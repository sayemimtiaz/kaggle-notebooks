The personal model:\nAssess how likely pupil characteristics and social life/circumstances are to contribute to a pupils grade.\n\nTakes into account:\n*Sex,\nRural or urban living space,\nReason for choosing school,\nRomantic relationship status,\nHealth,\nQuality of family relationships,\nFrequency of outings with friends.*\n\n3. The academic model:\nAssess how important academic life and exam performance rating is to pupil grades.\n\nTakes into account:\n*Whether a pupil had extra paid classes,\nIf a pupil went to extra curricular activities,\nPeriod 1 grade,\nPeriod 2 grade,\nAbsences,\nWeekly study time,\nWants to take higher education.*"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Data comes in as two csv files so I chose to combine the math and portuegese students into one data frame."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_math = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/student-alcohol-consumption/student-mat.csv\")\ndf_por = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/student-alcohol-consumption/student-por.csv\")\n\n# set math and por to binary\ndf_math[\"subject\"] = \"0\"\ndf_por[\"subject\"] = \"1\"\n\ndf = pd.concat([df_por, df_math])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data is then split into three seperate data frames, one for each model."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_mod1 = df.loc[:, ['Pstatus', 'Medu', 'Fedu', 'Mjob', 'Fjob', 'failures', 'nursery', 'G3']]\ndf_mod2 = df.loc[:, ['sex', 'address', 'reason', 'romantic', 'health', 'famrel', 'goout', 'G3']]\ndf_mod3 = df.loc[:, ['G1', 'G2', 'paid', 'activities', 'absences', 'higher', 'studytime', 'G3']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Standardising Variables\n\nI chose to set all text values to either binary -1 or 1 if there were two output options or to equal distances between -1 and 1 for wider categorical variables.

whether parents are still together.\n\nModel two seems to have the weakest coefficients though the strongest of these are where the student lives and how often they go out; with students in urban areas who go out less having better results this makes sense as they have a wider access to resources and more time to study.\n\nModel three however has strong coefficients especially for G2 this is

The modelling data used was the past academic performance of the pupil as well as other activities undertaken in their academic life.

The first lesson learned was that a pupils personal and family history have very little use when trying to determine how far a pupil will go meaning the son of a married teacher is just as likely to over-achieve or indeed under-achieve as the daughter of a divorced stay at home parent.\n\nThe second lesson learned was when predicting pupil results as with anything it's best (as with anything else) to work from the problem not from the photograph and use the closest data that accurately models the same system. In this case the best feature selected was grade during term two (G2) which is the most direct comparison as opposed to quality of family relationships (famrel) which is fairly abstract.\n\nFinally even though we decided model three (academic life) was the most accurate, it wasn't perfect. The students predicted to perform poorly mostly due to their G2 grade who then bootstrapped their learning or performed better on exam day in G3 (period three) were inaccurately placed by the regression. This to me seems like a feedback system in which the pupils found out how they performed in G2 and used the feedback to change the outcome.\n\nThe thing I would recommend coming out of the project is a message of acceptance, pupils from all backgrounds are equally capable or performance and under performance. The predictive power of any model is limited by the data it holds but so are human brains. The students who performed poorly and improved were able to use the feedback to their advantage and in future pupils who don't feel limited by social circumstance can out-perform every previous iteration of student that came before them."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
