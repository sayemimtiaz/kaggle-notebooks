It is crucial in the development of a successful product. In this notebook, we'll use the Meta Kaggle dataset to learn how to visualize, understand, and explore this key performance indicator.\n\nI'm particularly interested in the usage of Kernels. Therefore this notebook will only look at users which have created/forked at least one notebook.\n\nIn the end, I hope you'll be able to apply what you've learned and look at the retention of your own product.\n\n<img src=\"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/metricsandksfsforbuildingahighperformingcustomersuccessteam-150410171710-conversion-gate01/95/customer-success-best-practices-for-saas-retention-metrics-and-ksfs-for-building-a-high-performing-customer-success-team-10-638.jpg?cb=1428686468\" alt=\"thatdbegreat\" style=\"width: 400px\"/>\n\n## Overview\nBefore we dive into the data, let's understand what user retention is and why it's important. \n\n### What is retention?\nAt a high level, retention is our ability to make users come back to our product within a certain time period. \n\nIn our example, we would like users who created a notebook today to use Kernels again when they write their next notebook.\n\n### Why is retention important?\n***Retention tells us if we're building something worth building***. It helps us understand if we're providing value to our users. In ther words, retention tells us whether or not our product has market fit.\n\nIf we provide no value, we don't have a sustainable business.\n\nAcquiring new users is also expensive. And if we can't retain them, all the money put into user acquisition and growth hacking tactics will go to waste. \n\n### Spoiler Alert! What's a good retention rate?\nMaybe you already know what retention is. You might be simply trying to figure out what is a good number for your retention rate.\n\nA good retention rate is 15%! No wait... It's 10%. But it could also be 28%, 95% is definitely good I guess - *There's no magic number.* \n\nPersonally, I was frustrated when I couldn't find that magic number. Only after watching Alex Schultz's  [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_yHZ_vKjno) about retention that I understood why no particular number existed . I highly encourage you to do the same!\n\n## Exploring User Retention of Kernels\nIt's time for us to look at the data! \n\nWe will be looking at what percentage of new users come back in the following week, the week after, and so on. This will tell us how *sticky* Kernels is. Once we have a grasp in the overall user retention, we'll look at ways to make our insights actionable.\n\nIn the following sections we will:\n- Import libraries and load tables\n- Prepare the data for exploration (Data Wrangling).\n- Compute overall week-over-week (WoW) user retention.\n- Explore ways to make our analysis actionable.\n\n\n## Libraries and Tables\n\nTo compute user retention, we need only two tables:\n* A table with user signup dates\n* A table with user events (used to determine the dates an user was active)\n\nWe'll derive these tables from the `KernelVersions` dataset + competition activity\n\n* Note that we will set the \"start\" date by the first \"Activity\" from these tables, not the user registration date . (A user might register than have no activity for a while, then become active.

The overall user retention is what we've plotted above. However, there are certain groups of users who are more engaged than others.
