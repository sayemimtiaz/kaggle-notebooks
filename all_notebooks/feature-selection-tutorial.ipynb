We  all may have faced this problem of identifying the good features from the set of features we have or the features we created. Feature selection techniques will comes to rescue in this case. It is one of the core concepts in machine learning which hugely impacts the performance of your model. \n\nThe data features that you use to train your machine learning models have a huge influence on the performance you can achieve.Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact model performance.Feature selection and Data cleaning should be the first and most important step of your model designing.\n\n\n**Advantages of Feature selection:**\n\n<b>Reduces Overfitting:</b> Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.<br>\n\n<b>Improves Accuracy:</b>Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.<br>\n\n<b>Reduces Training Time:</b> fewer data points reduce algorithm complexity and algorithms train faster.<br>\n\nIn this notebook, we will familirize with some of the commonly used feature selection techniques.\n\n**1.
