In the *second kernel*, the first component of the solution pipeline : data integration and processing is implemented. It processes both core level data as well as department level data. In the *third kernel*, this pipeline is executed and run for several departments. After all the standardized and clean data is produced, it is analysed with different formats of the Analysis Framework in 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 kernels. In *kernel 4.1*, core analysis is done along with link with crime rate and poverty data. In *kernel 4.2*, core analysis is done along with statistical analysis.

Key Highlights <hr></font>\n\n\n- Different district's have witnessed different number of use-of-force incidents by police. Maximum use of force incidents are centered in district 1 where approximately 4,000 incidents occured in last 5 years. While in District 2 and District 3, only about 1000-1200 incidents occured.  \n- This data suggests that about use of force on Blacks was 3 times that of Whites. The percentage of Blacks being targeted equals 60% on an average which is quite higher than the other races, espicially Whites.  \n- About 71% of the police incidents are targeted on Blacks (population : 20%) while only, 27% incidents are targeted on Whites (population : 72%). Similarly, Asian population proportion is very low (about 1.5%) in all districts, but the use-of-force on them is higher (6.5% incidents).  \n- In three districts (1, 3, and 4), the subjects, the proportion of blacks being injured is very high ( about 50% in Dist 1, and 3, and about 80% in dist 4). However their population proportion in these districts is only (26%, 17%, and 40% respectively)  \n- Though the aggregted black's population is only 18% in all the districts, but the different use-of-force by police is on-an-average about 60% on blacks.  \n- While in districts 2 and 5, surprizingly a higher percentage of white population is stopped for vehicle checks. This also aligns with the subject injuries insights that we saw were higher among whites in district 2 and 5.  \n\n\nAll insights are obtained from the analysis framework and the detailed explanaions are provided in section 2. \n\n<a id=\"2\"></a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2. Deep Exploration of Police Activity : Use of Force <hr></font>\n\nAll the analysis is first done at high level and then by controlling the socio-econometric or demographic factors of the area which the department serves. The main idea of this analysis is to measure following points : \n\n- Are there racial disparities ?   \n- To what extent the racial disparities exist in the department ?  \n- What are the key factors that can explain racial disparities ?  \n\nAs the first step, we select the department and load the relevant datasets (that were produced from the data processing and analysis pipeline). There are two main datasets : Enriched district level data and processed Police Incidents Data.

For this purpose, We will explore two main metrics - \n\n1. High Crime Rates \n2. Low Poverty Ratios\n\n<a id=\"3.1\"></a>\n### <font color=\"#703bdb\">3.1 High Crime Rates</font>\n\nKey Questions that ponder are : \n\n- Can police behaviour be explained by high crime rates ?  \n- Does police are more active in areas where crime is actually high ? \n- Or more preciesly, police are active in areas where black population are higher ?   \n\nLet's explore the crime data of minneapolice districts in order to get these answers. We will plot the crime incidents that occured in Minneapolis city and their 5 districts along with the police activities. \n\nIn the following graph:\n\n- The <font color=\"blue\">\"blue\"</font> polygons represents the police districts.   \n- The <font color=\"red\">\"red\"</font> circles represents the aggregated crime statistics.  \n- The <font color=\"gray\">\"gray\"</font> circles represents the \"Use-of-Force\" by police  \n- The <font color=\"green\">\"green\"</font> circles represents the \"vehicle stops\" by police.  \n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"13b49548393e3fdaac199e1814a4570bc9da86bc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Load an external dataset about crime in minneapolis\ncrime = pd.read_csv(\"../input/external-datasets-cpe/minneapolis_Police_Incidents_2016.csv\")\n\ncr = crime[\"Precinct\"].value_counts().to_frame().reset_index().rename(columns={\"Precinct\" : \"CrimeCount\", \"index\" : \"LOCATION_DISTRICT\"})[:5]\ncr[\"LOCATION_DISTRICT\"] = cr[\"LOCATION_DISTRICT\"].astype(str)\npolice_df = police_df.merge(cr, on=\"LOCATION_DISTRICT\")\n\nmapc = folium.Map(center_ll, zoom_start=10.5, tiles='CartoDB dark_matter')\nfolium.GeoJson(shape_gdf, style_function = lambda feature: { 'fillColor': \"blue\", 'color' : \"blue\", 'weight' : 1, 'fillOpacity' : 0.2}).add_to(mapc)\nfor i, row in crime[crime['Description'] == \"Asslt W/dngrs Weapon\"].iterrows():\n    folium.CircleMarker([float(row[\"Lat\"]), float(row[\"Long\"])], radius=1, color='white').add_to(mapc)\n\nfor i, row in police_df.iterrows():    \n    dist_ll = _get_latlong_point(row[\"geometry\"].centroid)\n    folium.CircleMarker(dist_ll, popup=\"<b>District ID:</b>\" + row[\"LOCATION_DISTRICT\"] +\"<br> <b>Vehicle Stops:</b> \"+str(row[\"total_vstops\"]), \n                       radius=float(row[\"total_vstops\"])*0.01, color='green', fill=True).add_to(mapc)\n\n    folium.CircleMarker(dist_ll, popup=\"<b>District ID:</b>\" + row[\"LOCATION_DISTRICT\"] +\"<br> <b>Use of Force:</b> \"+str(row[\"total_incidents\"]), \n                       radius=float(row[\"total_incidents\"])*0.01, color='gray', fill=True).add_to(mapc)\n\n    folium.CircleMarker(dist_ll, popup=\"<b>District ID:</b>\" + row[\"LOCATION_DISTRICT\"] +\"<br> <b>Total Crime: </b> \"+str(row[\"CrimeCount\"]), \n                       radius=float(row[\"CrimeCount\"])*0.005, color='red', fill=True).add_to(mapc)\n\nmapc","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bd4c1302335d62f13fcfc614af9d1c2877d7967d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Inferences**\n\n> **Ideal Scenario :** More Crime Means More Vehicle Stops and More Use of Force   \n> ie.

Here, we want to check if the crime rate is higher where black population is higher.
