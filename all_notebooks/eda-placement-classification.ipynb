Having work experience increases the chance of being placed. Statistically speaking, 86.4% of students with work experience are placed while only 60% of students without it got placed. So we can say that having work experience is an opportunity worth chasing.  \n\n> from graph 4.0\n* If a student gets a degree from Science or Tech rather than  Communication or Management, the student will have a higher chance of being recruited.

Now it's time to modeling it using machine learning algorithms!\n\nI believe there is more than one task to use machine learning, such as: \n- Finding out if the student is placed or not,\n- Predicting the offered salary for placed students,\n\nI'll try to create a model to predict if a student is going to be placed or not. I'm going to compare different classification algorithms using k-fold cross-validation.\n\nRecall that the data was unbalanced. So we should consider using different metrics to evaluate our models. \n\nI'll use the following metrics:\n### Accuracy\nAccuracy is the most common metric for binary classification problems. \nIt's pretty preferable as a metric but when you have an imbalanced dataset like we have, upper-average accuracy may be obtainable by basic approaches such as picking the majority class.\n\n### Fbeta Measure\nFbeta score provides a way to combine recall and precision into a single measure that captures both of them, it's also widely used while working on imbalanced datasets. The mathematical formula for Fbeta measure is\n\n$ F_{beta} = \\frac{( 1+(\\text{beta}^2) ) \\times \\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{(\\text{beta}^2 \\times \\text{Precision}) + \\text{Recall}} $\n\nI think we can say that Fbeta measure is just a modified version of the F1 measure. We can control the calculation of harmonic mean with coefficient __beta__. When beta is equal to `1`, that means we're using the F1 score.\n\n### G-Mean\nG-Mean is the geometric mean of Recall and True Negative Rate. So it also provides a way to combine two different metrics into a single measure just like Fbeta measure.\n\n\n### ROC AUC Score\nTo understand the ROC AUC score, we should understand what ROC is. ROC curve summarizes the model behavior by using TPR (True Positive Rate) and FPR (False Positive Rate). When we plot these two by different thresholds, we get a curve that is called as the ROC curve. The area under this curve is the metric known as ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). \nIn simple terms, the ROC curve describes how good our model is at discriminating the target classes. The area under the curve gives us this description as a scalar value.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import the classification models \nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n# I'll be testing the models using different metrics.\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, fbeta_score, average_precision_score, roc_auc_score, roc_curve\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import make_scorer\n# In order to do a proper test on the models, we should use KFold cross-validation\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, KFold\n# After testing different algorithms, we need to optimize the algorithm further.\n# I'll try to do this by using Grid Search\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV\n# Evaluation with cross validation offers more generalized results\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# the most basic approach would be picking the majority class all the time. \nsimple_baseline = np.ones(len(y_test))\naccuracy_score(y_test, simple_baseline)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Utility function to calculate the geometric mean of sensitivity (recall) and specificity (TNR)\ndef g_mean(y_true, y_preds):\n    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_preds)\n    tn, fp, fn, tp = cm.ravel()\n    sensivity = tp / (tp + fn)\n    specifity = tn / (tn + fp)\n    g_mean_score = np.sqrt(sensivity * specifity)\n    return g_mean_score\ng_mean_scorer = make_scorer(g_mean)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# I'll store the models in baseline_models list.\nbaseline_models = [LogisticRegression(), SVC(probability = True), \n                   KNeighborsClassifier(), GaussianNB(), \n                   DecisionTreeClassifier(), RandomForestClassifier()]\n\nbaseline_model_names = ['Logistic Regression', 'Support Vector Classifier', \n                        'K Nearest Neighbors', 'Gaussian Naive Bayes', \n                        'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest']\n\nmetric_names = ['Accuracy', 'F1 Score', 'G-Mean', 'ROC AUC Score']\n\n# I'll apply 5 fold cross-validation to get a better inspection about the models\nn_splits = 5\n\n# Store the results so we can compare the models\nresults = np.zeros((len(baseline_models), len(metric_names)))\n\nfor i in range(len(baseline_models)):\n    # Initialize an array to store the fold results\n    model_results = np.zeros((n_splits, len(metric_names)))\n    \n    # Initialize the StratifiedKFold object with 5 splits.    \n    skf = KFold(n_splits)\n    skf.get_n_splits(X_train, y_train)\n    \n    # Get the model\n    model = baseline_models[i]\n    \n    for fold_iter, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(skf.split(X_train,y_train)):\n        # Get the training and test folds\n        X_train_fold, X_test_fold = X_train[train_index], X_train[test_index]\n        y_train_fold, y_test_fold = y_train[train_index], y_train[test_index]\n        \n        # Fit the data to the model \n        model.fit(X_train_fold, y_train_fold)\n        # Evaluate the test fold\n        model_predictions = model.predict(X_test_fold)\n        model_pred_probs = model.predict_proba(X_test_fold)\n        # Get the evaluation scores \n        acc = accuracy_score(y_test_fold, model_predictions)\n        f1_score = fbeta_score(y_test_fold, model_predictions, beta = 1)\n        g_mean_score = g_mean(y_test_fold, model_predictions)\n        roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test_fold, model_pred_probs[:,1])\n        # Store the results in the model_results array\n        model_results[fold_iter] = [acc, f1_score, g_mean_score, roc_auc]\n        \n    # The final result for the model is going to be the average of stratified cross-validation results\n    final_result = model_results.mean(axis = 0)\n    # store the results along with the model name in \"results\" list\n    results[i] = final_result\n\n# print out the results as a dataframe\nskf_results_df = pd.DataFrame(results, \n                              columns = [\"Average %s for %d Folds\"%(metric, n_splits) for metric in metric_names],\n                              index = baseline_model_names)\nskf_results_df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In over-all performance, Logistic Regression beats the other models.
