All comments welcome :)\n\nSome parts of the code (modfied and used as is) has been taken or was inspired from the original work by Dr Mehdi Mohammadi and improvisation work by ryches.

Data was collected using iPhone 6S. The dataset contains two sub-datasets: a labeled dataset (1420 instances) and an unlabeled dataset (5191 instances). The recording was performed during the operational hours of the library. For the labeled dataset, the input data contains the location (label column), a timestamp, followed by RSSI readings of 13 iBeacons. RSSI measurements are negative values. Bigger RSSI values indicate closer proximity to a given iBeacon (e.g., RSSI of -65dBm represent a closer distance to a given iBeacon compared to RSSI of -85dBm). For out-of-range iBeacons, the RSSI is indicated by -200dBm. The locations related to RSSI readings are combined in one column consisting a letter for the column and a number for the row of the position.\n\n## Importing Data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"path='../input/ble-rssi-dataset/iBeacon_RSSI_Labeled.csv'\ndata = pd.read_csv(path, index_col=None)\ndata.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Exploration","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plots = data.hist(bins=15, figsize=(20,20))\n\nfor ax in plots.flatten():\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Signal Strength\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"count\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the above plot, we can understand that the strength of signal from each of the beacons is on either ends of the strength spectrum i.e. either good signal or no signal at all.
