Due to its technological impact, its open-source code and the possibility of installing applications from third parties without any central control, Android has recently become a malware target. Even if it includes security mechanisms, the last news about malicious activities and Android´s vulnerabilities point to the importance of continuing the development of methods and frameworks to improve its security.\n\nTo prevent malware attacks, researches and developers have proposed different security solutions, applying static analysis, dynamic analysis, and artificial intelligence. Indeed, data science has become a promising area in cybersecurity, since analytical models based on data allow for the discovery of insights that can help to predict malicious activities.\n\nWe can analyze cyber threats using two techniques, static analysis, and dynamic analysis, the most important thing is that these are the approaches to get the features that we are going to use in data science.\n\n+ **Static analysis**: it includes the methods that allow us to get information about the software that we want to analyze without executing it, one example of them is the study of the code, their callings, resources, etc.\n+ **Dynamic analysis**: it is another approach where the idea is to analyze the cyber threat during its execution, in other words, get information about its behavior, some of their features are the netflows.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# State of the Art\n\nIn 2016 we published an article [2] about the state of the art of frameworks and results about Android malware detection. This work reflects different static analysis tools (TaintDroid, Stowaway, Crowdroid y Airmid), dynamic analysis systems (Paranoid and DroidMOSS), frameworks (MobSafe, SAAF, and ASEF) and some research results about using machine learning. From this article we concluded that the idea is using both static and dynamic analysis in order to get spectra of features, moreover, some works have been working to use virtual devices in the cloud.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Datasets\n\nIn 2016 we explored [3] Android Genome Project (MalGenome), it is a dataset which was active from 2012 until the end of the year 2015, this set of malware has a size of 1260 applications, grouped into a total of 49 families. Today, we can find other jobs such as: Drebin, a research project offering a total of 5560 applications consisting of 179 malware families; AndrooZoo, which includes a collection of 5669661 applications Android from different sources (including Google Play); VirusShare, another repository that provides samples of malware for cybersecurity researchers; and DroidCollector, this is another set which provides around 8000 benign applications and 5560 malware samples, moreover, it facilitates us samples of network traffic as pcap files."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Static Analysis \n\nIn this first step, I'm going to analyze some features in order to answer the next hypothesis, *exist a differential of the permissions used between a set of malware and benign samples*, in other words… \n\n<img src=\"https://pics.me.me/when-the-flashlight-app-wants-access-to-your-call-history-32812256.png\" height=\"250\" width=\"250\">\n\nFor this approach, I developed a code that consisted to extract and make a CSV file which has information about permissions of applications, through this script you can map each APK (Android Application Package) against a list of permissions.
