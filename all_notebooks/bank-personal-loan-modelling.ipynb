The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan\ncampaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted\nthe personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.\n\n<b>Domain:</b>\n    Banking\n\n<b>Context:</b>\n    This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as\ndepositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a\nhealthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing\ndepartment to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success\nratio with minimal budget.\n\n<b>Learning Outcomes:</b>\n\n   -  Exploratory Data Analysis\n   -  Data Cleaning\n   -  Data Visualization\n   -  Preparing the data to train a model \n   -  Training and making predictions using a classification model\n   -  Model evaluation\n    \n<b>Objective:</b>\n    The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans which means we have to build a model which will be used to predict which customer will most likely to accept the offer for personal loan, based on the specific relationship with the bank across various features given in the dataset. Here I will be using the Supervised Learning methods to predict which model is best for this problem amongst Logistic Regresssion, K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and Naive Bayes Algorigthm.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import the necessary libraries :"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nfrom scipy import stats\n\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n# To model the Gaussian Navie Bayes classifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report,confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score # Performance measure – Accuracy\n\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<b>Comment :</b> Here I have used numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy for EDA and Data Visualization.
