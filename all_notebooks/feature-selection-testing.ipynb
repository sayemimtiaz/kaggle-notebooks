This can lead to two problems. First, the more features you have, the more likely you are to overfit to the training and validation sets. This will cause your model to perform worse at generalizing to new data.\n\nSecondly, the more features you have, the longer it will take to train your model and optimize hyperparameters. Also, when building user-facing products, you'll want to make inference as fast as possible.

The F-value measures the linear dependency between the feature variable and the target. This means the score might underestimate the relation between a feature and the target if the relationship is nonlinear. The mutual information score is nonparametric and so can capture nonlinear relationships.\n\nWith `SelectKBest`, we define the number of features to keep, based on the score from the scoring function.

Instead, we can make our selection using all of the features by including them in a linear model with L1 regularization.

This allows us to perform feature selection by adjusting the regularization parameter. We choose the parameter by finding the best performance on a hold-out set, or decide ahead of time how many features to keep.\n\nFor regression problems you can use `sklearn.linear_model.Lasso`, or `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` for classification.

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) learns a new representation for your data that reduces the number of features while retaining information. \n\nPCA learns a set of linearly uncorrelated component vectors, the number of components defined by the user. The first component points in the direction of the greatest variance in the original data. The second component points in the direction of the next highest variance, with the constraint that it is orthogonal to the first component. Each higher component follows similarly, they point in the direction of highest variance given the constraint of orthogonality.\n\nScikit-learn provides this as `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`. Our data here has only 3 numerical features so this isn't a great example, but I can still show how it works. Fitting the components is straightforward, it follows the sklearn API.

This method is the slowest, but also attempts to keep all the relevant features.\n\nBoruta firsts creates a clone of the original dataset then shuffles the values in each feature creating \"shadow features\". Then it trains a tree-based model on the merged original and shadow datasets to get importances for each feature.\n\nThe features that have a higher importance than the best shadow feature are recorded and the process is repeated. Features that are doing better than the shadow features, above random chance, are selected and removed from the dataset. Features that go 15 iterations without being better than the shadow features are removed.
