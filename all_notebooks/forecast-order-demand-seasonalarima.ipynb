Either by transforming the data using box-cox or log transformation which 'normalizes' the data. Alternatively, a model that does not require a linear trend on continuous features can be used too. Some models include the grand dad ARIMA model or the newer ones including facbook's prophet or even deep learning. I will implement them in subsequent commits.
