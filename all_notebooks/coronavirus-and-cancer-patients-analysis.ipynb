The most detailed dataset I have seen is the [dataset from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in São Paolo, Brazil](https://www.kaggle.com/einsteindata4u/covid19/) that contains anonymized lab results for patients, including whether they tested positive for COVID-19. The description of the data is as follows:\n\n>This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at São Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.\n>\n>All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.\n\nI hypothesize that it is possible to use the lab results in this dataset to infer which patients may have cancer, allowing us to answer the questions posed by this task."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here are the details about this notebook that address the evaluation criteria:\n\n>1. Scientific rigor\n>a. Is the solution evidence based? I.e. does it leverage robust data?\n\nYes, the solution is based on data collected by a well-regarded hospital.\n\n>2. Scientific model/strategy\n>a. Did the solution employ a robust scientific method?\n\nThe solution attempts to answer the question posed while being conservative about which data is used in the analysis (since the solution uses the data to infer the answer to the question, it was prudent to consider a more-conservative approach).\n\n>3. Unique and novel insight\n>a. Does the solution identify information (new data, features, insights etc) that is yet to be “uncovered?”\n\nYes, the solution attempts to identify cancer patients based on their lab results instead of a direct cancer diagnosis.\n\n>4. Market Translation and Applicability\n>a. Does the solution resolve an existing market need for either an individual, health institution or policy maker?\n\nPossibly; given more complete data, this method could identify specific lab markers or tests that could be used to identify severe cases of the coronavirus.\n\n>5. Speed to market\n>a. Does it apply to an existing product vision such as a self assessment tool or policy decision-making tool?\n\nPossibly, given more data (as stated in the previous question.\n\n>6. Longevity of solution in market\n>a. Is the solution one that could be used in various markets through time?\n\nYes, given more data.\n\n>7. Ability of user to collaborate and contribute to other solutions within the Kaggle community\n>a. Did the user provide expertise and or resources in the form of datasets or models to their fellow Kaggle members?\n\nI have not created any models yet, due to the small amount of data I have been able to extract from this dataset. If I am able to find other datasets, it would be possible to create models based on this technique."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import csv, sys, math\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Read data into a pandas dataframe\neinsteinFile = \"/kaggle/input/uncover/einstein/diagnosis-of-covid-19-and-its-clinical-spectrum.csv\"\nhealthDF = pd.read_csv(einsteinFile)\n\nhealthDF.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Show the columns available in this dataset\nhealthDF.columns.values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From a quick peek at the data:\n* the 3rd column, *sars_cov_2_exam_result*, indicates whether the patient tested positive for COVID-19 or not\n* the next three columns indicate whether the patient was admitted to the hospital and if so, to which unit (regular ward, semi-intensive unit, intensive care) -- **these columns can be used to indicate the severity of the sickness for these patients**\n* the columns after that (column 7 and later) represent results of tests that were run on the patient -- **these columns can be used to determine which patients had cancer**\n\nTo start, I identify the lab tests for which we have a large enough sample size to be considered representative of the population.

With additional data, we may be able to delve more into how specific parts of the population are affected. Aspects I would hope to be able to study in the future (assuming more data is forthcoming) are:\n\n* With more data, we could use Machine Learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest) to predict when cancer and non-cancer patients are likely to have the coronavirus. With algorithms like Random Forest, we can also determine which lab tests (features) are important to and indicative of a positive coronavirus test. If the features are different for cancer patients vs non-cancer patients, that might give doctors a good idea of which tests to prioritize for the patient. \n*Note: I started going down this path, and saw some differences in models created from cancer vs. non-cancer patients, but I didn't feel confident in reporting the results given I only had 28 non-cancer datapoints to work with).*\n\n* With more lab tests reported per patient, we could include more numerical lab tests in our analysis (sample size would be larger).\n\n* If the gender of the patient is provided, we may be able to pinpoint how high/low test results contribute towards a coronavirus diagnosis (normal ranges for lab tests are often different between male/female).\n\n* We could also start to delve into how much higher/lower a patient's test results are from the mean, and determine how that affects the coronavirus diagnosis.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
