A person can choose between purchasing a membership\nkey or short-term pass. A membership key entitles an annual membership, and the key\ncan be obtained from a kiosk. Advantages for members include quick retrieval of bikes\nand unlimited 45-minute rentals. Short-term passes offer access to bikes for a 24-hour\nor 3-day time interval.
