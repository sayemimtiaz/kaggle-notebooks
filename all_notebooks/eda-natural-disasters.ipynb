Overview**\n\nIn 1988, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) launched the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). EM-DAT was created with the initial support of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Belgian Government.\n\nThe main objective of the database is to serve the purposes of humanitarian action at national and international levels. The initiative aims to rationalise decision making for disaster preparedness, as well as provide an objective base for vulnerability assessment and priority setting.\n\nEM-DAT contains essential core data on the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day. The database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies.\n\n## 1.1. Content ##\n\nThe current data was obtained by querying the EM-DAT database on 4th March 2021. Only Natural Disasters were considered, excluding Technological and Complex Disasters options. All locations of the world were also enabled. The time period starts in 1900 to the current year, 2021.\n\nFor an event to be registered into the EM-DAT database it must fulfill one of three entry criteria:\n\n* **Deaths**: 10 or more people deaths\n\n* **Affected**: 100 or more people affected/injured/homeless.\n\n* **Declaration/international appeal**: Declaration by the country of a state of emergency and/or an appeal for international assistance\n    \n\n## 1.1. Acknowledgements ##\n\nI cannot make this dataset public as I am not the one creating or mantaining it. It can be downloaded in the link below.\n\nThe credit for creating and maintaining the Database is for the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters - CRED and the School of Public Health from the Université catholique de Louvain.\n\n“EM-DAT, CRED / UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium – www.emdat.be (D.
