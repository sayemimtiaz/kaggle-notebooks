While disease onset is usually focal (symptoms start in one specific site – either limb or bulbar), multifocal (symptoms start in multiple sites) onset is possible and can occur in both limbs and bulbar regions simultaneously.\n\nALS is defined as Limb Onset when the symptoms initially appear in the limbs of the body, either the arms or legs. Limb Onset ALS accounts for the majority of all cases of ALS.\n\nAccording to two independent studies, approximately three-quarters of all ALS cases with a focal onset (onset of the disease in one specific site) are reported as limb onset. It was found that 74% of focal ALS cases were limb onset and  reported that 71% of focal ALS cases were limb onset.\n\nSymptoms vary from person to person but typical initial symptoms of Limb Onset ALS include muscle cramps or stiffness, muscle twitching (fasciculation), muscle loss (atrophy), weakness in the hands, legs, feet or ankles, and loss of grip strength.\n\nEarly signs that you may have one or more of these symptoms include loss of balance or problems with walking such as tripping or stumbling, as well as difficulty performing routine tasks such as buttoning a shirt or writing with a pen.\n\nALS is classified as Bulbar Onset when the symptoms first occur in the face or neck. Although progression is variable by case, Bulbar Onset ALS tends to have a faster progression than Limb Onset cases.\n\nEarly symptoms include slurred speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, excessive choking and weakness or twitching in the muscles of the face, jaw, throat and voice box, particularly the tongue.\n\nSigns that these symptoms may be occurring include difficulty forming words, poor articulation and changes in voice or speech patterns, including a harsh, hoarse or strained voice, and decrease in range or loudness of voice.\n\nhttps://www.als.net/news/science-sunday-limb-and-bulbar-onset-als/#:~:text=ALS%20is%20classified%20as%20Bulbar,progression%20than%20Limb%20Onset%20cases.
