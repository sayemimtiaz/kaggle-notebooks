Such a foundation consist of specific steps that we need to perform necessary actions, gather the required information, and finally perform a well-structured and holistic data analysis.\n\n#### Problem Identification/ Problem statement\n\nAt the first step, we should understand what exactly the problem is, which logics exist behind the problem, how does it affect all the involved parties, and what are clarified points of the main objective in the current data science project.\n\n\nThe main idea of this project is to extract actionable insights from the given data of a company that improves their decision-making process. Furthermore, we want to provide the best possible predictive model for the marketing campaign of their new product which shows if a customer buys the new product or not and how much is the possibility of the purchase.\n\n\n#### Data Description\n\nThe provided data is split into two CSV files containing the training (`train.csv`), and the test data (`test.csv`). The **training date set** includes **31480 records**, containing customer and operational features. Customer features cover master data of customers such as their `age`, `gender`, `occupation`, `marital status`, `education level` and `account balance`, while operational features are related to the last campaign activities including `last campaign result`, `contact date`, `contact duration`, etc. The **test date set** consists of **13732 samples** containing all the provided features in training data except the target value. In general, we have **19 features and one target variable**\nthat should be predicted. These features can be described as follows:\n\n| Feature                       | Type      | Description                                                |\n| :--                           | :--       | :--                                                        |\n| id                            | Numerical | record ID                                                  |\n| target                        | Nominal   | target value (customer response to the marketing campaign) |\n| day                           | Numerical | contact day in previous campaign                           |\n| month                         | Nominal   | contact month in previous campaign                         |\n| duration                      | Numerical | contact duration in previous campaign                      |\n| contactId                     | Numerical | contact ID                                                 |\n| age                           | Numerical | age of the customer                                        |\n| gender                        | Nominal   | customer gender                                            |\n| job                           | Nominal   | customer occupation                                        |\n| maritalStatus                 | Nominal   | customer marital status                                    |\n| education                     | Nominal   | customer educational degree                                |\n| craditFailure                 | Nominal   | if the customer has a default credit                       |\n| accountBalance                | Numerical | customer account balance                                   |\n| house                         | Nominal   | if the customer owns a house                               |\n| credit                        | Nominal   | if the customer has a credit                               |\n| contactType                   | Nominal   | contact media                                              |\n| numberOfContacts              | Numerical | number of contacts during the current campaign             |\n| daySinceLastCampaign          | Numerical | days after the last contact of the previous campaign       |\n| numberOfContactsLastCampaign  | Numerical | number of contacts during the previous campaign            |\n| lastCampaignResult            | Nominal   | result of the previous campaign                            |\n\n\n#### Brainstorming\n\nDuring the brainstorming, we need to ask some interesting questions that we can try to answer during our data analysis process. This step is really useful for providing meaningful and actionable insights for the customer. Here we might ask:\n\n- What are the most important factors that influence the success rate of the campaign?\n- What is the amount of correlation between the given features and target value? \n- Does the age, gender, education level, and other individual properties of each customer affect the campaign result? \n- Does the campaign performance vary in different seasons?\n- Does the time of contacts and their frequencies affect the result?\n- Is there any correlation between results of the previous campaign and the current one? \n- How can we detect our most loyal and most unsatisfied customers?\n- Is there any relationship between the contact type and the campaign result?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exploratory Data Analysis - Business Intelligence\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important primary step in each data analytics process.

As described earlier, this can be due to a change in marketing strategy (contacting new customers more than the loyal ones to attract more new customers) during those periods.   \n\nFor a better visualization of these insights, I divided the year into 4 quarters and showed the result for each quarter separately.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Campaign Cumulative Flow Diagram(CFD)\n\nIn this part, the Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) of the both success and failure rates of the campaign is used as a valuable tool for tracking the performance of the campaign: ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# cumulative results of the campaign along the year\n\nmonths = ['feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']\ndays   = [31, 59, 90, 120, 151, 181, 212, 243, 273, 304, 334]\n\nsuccesses = Data.loc[Data['target'] == 'yes'][['dayNum', 'target']]\ns_acc = successes.groupby('dayNum').count()\ns_acc['yes'] = s_acc['target'].cumsum()\ns_acc['dayN'] = s_acc.index\n\nfailures = Data.loc[Data['target'] == 'no'][['dayNum', 'target']]\nf_acc = failures.groupby('dayNum').count()\nf_acc['no'] = f_acc['target'].cumsum()\nf_acc['dayN'] = f_acc.index\n\nacc= pd.merge(f_acc, s_acc, how='inner', on='dayN')\n\nsuccesses = acc['yes'].fillna(0).astype('int16')\nfailures = acc['no'].fillna(0).astype('int16')\ndayNums = acc['dayN'].astype('int16')\n\nx_tick_location = [min(dayNums)] + days + [365] \nx_tick_labels = [mon for mon in months]\nx_tick_labels = ['jan'] + x_tick_labels + ['']\n\n\nhist_data = [successes, failures]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Success', 'Failure']\n\nfig = go.Figure(data=[\n    go.Line(name='Success', x= dayNums, y=successes, line=dict(color='green')),\n    go.Line(name='Failure', x= dayNums, y=failures, line=dict(color='red'))\n]\n               )\n\n\nfig.update_layout(\n        xaxis = dict(\n        #tickmode = 'array',\n        tickvals = x_tick_location,\n        ticktext = x_tick_labels\n        )\n)\n\nfig.update_layout(\n        xaxis_title_text = 'time of the year',\n        yaxis_title_text = 'campaign success/failure quantity',\n        title = 'Cumulative campaign success/failure rates along the year'\n    )\n\n\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-20T05:04:57.949323Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-20T05:04:57.949778Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-20T05:04:58.013106Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-20T05:04:57.949733Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-20T05:04:58.011986Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, we can see the cumulative illustration of the campaign results along the year showing how fast the number of negative feedbacks grows in comparison with the positive answers.

The <span style=\"color:green\">**call duration (duration)**</span> has a positive influence on response of the customer to the campaign.

So, the likelihood of the campaign success is more for the customers who have <span style=\"color:green\">**accepted the previous campaign**</span>, too (remeber those lovely super positive clients?).\n\n3. Concering the correlation of the contact type, <span style=\"color:black\">**cellPhone>landline>unknown**</span>. It's a good idea, to call the customers on their <span style=\"color:green\">**cell phone**</span> rather than a <span style=\"color:red\">**landline number**</span>. But remember, during the campaign, we contacted the vast majority of the customers through their cellphone. So, there is a bias on contact type of the customers and so, such a conclusion does not provide a real benefit. \n\n4. Some months of the year such as <span style=\"color:green\">**March, October** </span>and <span style=\"color:green\">**September**</span> are the best time to call the customers. But again, we remember that those months are the time in which our contact numbers were low and possibly limited to our loyal customers, so the campaign success rate growed due to less number of contacts not the time of the year. But still, let's ask our employees to be more active during those months. :) \n\n5. Since both the <span style=\"color:green\">**daySinceLastCampaign & numberOfContactsLastCampaign**</span> have a positive correlations with the target, it's a good idea to call the customers whom we did not call for a while and were strongly involved in the last campaign.\n\n6. It's beneficial to concentrate on <span style=\"color:green\">**retired customers**</span> as well as customers who are <span style=\"color:green\">**student**</span>.\n\n7. For <span style=\"color:green\">**single customers**</span> it's more likely to accept the campaign than the ones who are <span style=\"color:red\">**married**</span> (being single has a positive correlation with the target, while being married has a negative correlation)\n\n8.

This is simple to implement and sets a relatively low bar for our models: if they cannot do better than guessing the medin value, then we will need to rethink our approach.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To be sure that our data is splitted correctly, we may check if two sets of training and test data have an equal proportion of positive samples:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"[dataCols, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test] = orgData(Data)\n\nprint('percentage of positive labels in training data: {:.2f}%' . format(sum(y_train)/len(y_train)*100))\nprint('percentage of positive labels in test data: {:.2f}%' . format(sum(y_test)/len(y_test)*100))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.698282Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.698735Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.744163Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.698691Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.743171Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"y_baseline = np.random.randint(2, size=len(y_test))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.745489Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.745813Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.750766Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.74578Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-20T05:05:04.749914Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before going further we have to think about the meaning and the importance of two concepts in our problem:\n\n1. **False Positive predictions (Type I error)**: means we wrongly classified negative customers (who will reject the campaign) as positive customers (who will accept the campaign).
