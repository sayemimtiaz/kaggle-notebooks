{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Storytelling COVID-19; New York update\n\nInitially, I just wanted to know how bad the situation in my country, the Netherlands, was compared to other countries as we had high numbers of confirmed cases and only 17 million inhabitants. In order to do so, I used the [Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) and I uploaded my own dataset: [Countries of the World; ISO codes and population](https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin/countries-of-the-world-iso-codes-and-population), and made plotly world maps based on the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths per million inhabitants.\n\nAfter having done that, the pandemic unfortunately became worse and worse, and I wanted to investigate more. This version includes time series trends and also time series trends that start at the date of the first confirmed case/death reported (\"Day Zero\"). On April 12th, I wanted to add more insight on the situation in the US, and therefore added dataset [COVID-19 US County JHU Data & Demographics](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/covid19-us-county-jhu-data-demographics).\n\nI will continue to keep adding interesting insights to this notebook and polish my story. If you like what I am doing, an upvote is always appreciated.\n\n**Observations on April 22nd**\n*(Please be aware that this may be different if you fork and run this kernel, as the dataset is updated daily)*\n\n- When looking at the number of death per million, Belgium is now the country with the highest number of Deaths per Million. However, if we would treat the US states of New York and New Jersey as countries, the ranking would be as follows:\n    - 1. New York State, 2. New Jersey, 3. Belgium, 4. Spain, 5 Italy\n- The relative Death rate of New York are terrible. While countries such as Belgium, Italy and Spain have rates around 400 Death per Million, the state of New York has 958 Deaths per Million , and New York City has 1730 Death per Million!\n\n- Spain is the country with most confirmed cases per million inhabitants, with Switzerland, Italy and Belgium also having high ratio's. All other countries in the \"top\" 10  of countries with the highest numbers of cases per million inhabitants are also Western European countries, with the US at 7th place.\n\n- The US is the country with the highest (absolute) number of confirmed cases and unfortunately the trend is steep upward. Over the past couple of days the US has also passed Spain and became the country with the second highest number of victims after Italy.\n\n- When looking the the time series of the cumulative numbers of deaths while taking the day of the first reported death as \"Day Zero\", we can see that China managed to flatten the curve while in Italy and Spain the number of victims really exploded after 15-20 days after the first casualty. Although more \"delayed\", the trend is now looking very bad for especially the US.\n\n- Russia, Saudi Arabia and Israel are doing best when looking at the number of deadly victims relative to the number of confirmed cases.\n\n# Table of contents\n* [1.
