This notebook discusses the performance of Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) [1], and efficient transfer learning approach that can be applied to any NLP function, and implementing techniques that are essential to fine-tune a language model.

However, finetuning inductive transfer was ineffective for NLP. Language model (LM) fine-tuning requires millions of in-domain documents to achieve good results, which significantly limits its applicability. Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) solves these issues and facilitates stable, inductive learning transfers for any NLP function.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"3- Model Description\n=================\n\nThe model used is the state-of-the-art language model AWD-LSTM \\[2\\], a\nstandard LSTM with various tuned dropout hyper-parameters (with no\ninput, short-cut links, or other sophisticated additions).\n\nULMFiT consists of three stages (Figure 1):\n\n> a\\) The LM is trained on a **general-domain** corpus to capture\n> general features of the language in different layers.\n>\n> b\\) The full LM is **fine-tuned** on target task data using\n> discriminative fine-tuning ('Discr') and slanted triangular learning\n> rates (STLR) to learn task-specific features.\n>\n> c\\) The classifier is fine-tuned on the target task using **gradual\n> unfreezing**, 'Discr', and STLR to preserve low-level representations\n> and adapt high-level ones (shaded: unfreezing stages; black: frozen).\n\n<img src=\"../input/images/ULMFit.png\" alt=\"Figure 1.

Instead of using the same learning rate for all layers of the model, Discriminative fine-tuning allows one to apply specific learning levels to each layer. \nIt was empirically found that it performed well to select the last layer's Alpha^L learning rate first by fine-tuning only the last layer and using Alpha^(L-1) = (Alpha^L)/2.6 as the lesser layer learning rate.
