Structure the literature corpus as a dataframe of article sections\n1. Keyword search to identify articles that contain entities of interest: COVID-19\n2. Information Extraction using Stanford's OpenIE to extract IE triplets: (`object`, `relation`, `subject`)\n3. Removing redundant triplets in each article section\n4. Generating Triplet Database to answer questions\n5. Report creation by building a Knowledge Graph and providing structured insights\n\n### Acknowledgements\n* Ivan Ega Pratama.

of this approach"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have implemented a general solution that provides an end-to-end methodology to extract information of interest from a text corpus.\nBy applying it to articles related to Covid-19, our tool can provide any information of interest in a concise, structured manner (Knowledge Graph representation and CSV table with relevant subject-relation-object triplets) given a keyword search by the user.\nWe apply our solution on the Covid-19 subset of articles to extract information of interest for the Challenge Task \"What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?\".\n\nWe would like to emphasize the flexibility of our approach, which is based on dividing the corpus of articles in article sections, and within those, extracting and indentifying relevant triplets.\n\nOur solution provides:\n- A flexible framework for information retrieval from a corpus of scientific articles\n- Extraction of triplets per article section, providing full traceability back to the source article(s)/section(s)\n- Keyword search based on both title/section/content of the articles and extracted triplets (object, relation, subject)\n- Knowledge Graph representation of the results\n- Graphical front-end as implemented in our externally hosted tool http://covid19search.net\n\n\nWe also identify some current weaknesses that we can improve and iterate in next revisions:\n- Expand the search to articles in the corpus that do not explicitly mention the Covid-19 keywords\n- Improve the flexibility of the search approach by adding more logical operators, at the moment the different keys of the filter dictionary are combined in an AND fashion, and the values only allow OR opperations\n- Usage of NLP techniques from lemmatization, stemming and even embedding feature representations to obtain better results than using keyword searches and being able to normalize triplet entities\n- Exploit the Knowledge Graph representation by leveraging transitive relations between the nodes, this would require good normalization of the triplet entities in the fashion indicated above\n\nThe usage of more sophisticated NLP would help combat the main limitation of the current approach: much of the ability to find relevant answers to these questions rely on a skilful selection of the keywords. In cases where the keywords are nouns that are highly specific medical terms (e.g. naproxen, ADE) it is much more straightforward to extract relevant information. However, when the questions are asked around more general nouns (e.g. production, healthcare workers) it is more challenging to find specific results. The sub-graph produced by the search algorithm becomes non-sparse due to the use of these general nouns in a wide-variety of contexts, that may not necessarily relate to the question being answered. Moreover, a large number of synonyms for one given keyword can present time-constraint challenges to performing a full search on the knowledge graph.\n\nDue to these limitations we were not able to find direct answers to the posed questions. Here are some hand-picked examples of triplets related to the questions, although they do not directly provide the answer.
