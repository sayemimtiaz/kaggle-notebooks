Set was read\n#### 2) With Exploratory Data Analysis;\n* Structural information of the dataset was checked.\n* Types of variables in data set were examined.\n* The size information of the data set has been accessed.\n* The number of missing observations from which variable in the data set was accessed. It was observed that there were 59 missing observations only in \"Salary\" which was dependent variable.\n* Descriptive statistics of the data set were examined.\n\n#### 3) In Data Pre-Processing section;\n*For df: ** NA values were filled by looking at \"Salary\" averages in age, league and division variables, Dummy variables were created. The X variables were normalized.\n\n#### 4) During the Model Building phase;\n\nUsing the Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet machine learning models, ** RMSE ** values representing the difference between actual values and predicted values were calculated. Later, hyperparameter optimizations were applied for Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet to further reduce the error value.\n\n#### 4) Conclusion;\n\nWhen the model created as a result of Elastic Net Hyperparameter optimization was applied to the df6 Data Frame, the lowest RMSE was obtained.
