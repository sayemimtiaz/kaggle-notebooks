As a user types their question, 22,000+ abstracts are ranked in realtime, and the top result is displayed. Additionally, users may filter by automatically determined topics. To run, log in to Kaggle, click the \"Copy and Edit\", and run all cells (takes about 3 minutes). Scroll to the bottom to see the following search widget:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ptrEnu0.png)\n\nThis notebook strives to demonstrate the simplest way to use BioBERT for vectorizing academic medical texts, and how to use CorEx for topic modeling.
