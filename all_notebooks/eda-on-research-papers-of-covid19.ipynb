These too are arranged in descending order of their counts.\n\n**Findings:** In my findings I see that Table 1 varies greatly from Table 2 in terms of the papers selected i.e. the papers which have a target word occuring frequently in its abstract doesnot necessarily have the word occuring frequently in its full-text. Hence Table 3 comes into play\n\n* Table 3: Displays the same paper as Table 1 but with  the count of the target words in the full-text\n\nGraph: I then used a clustered stacked bar-graph to compare Table 1 and Table 3 i.e. it will show me- if a paper has a target word occuring frequently in its abstract field then what is its count in the full-text field.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"targets = ['vaccine','vaccination','vaccines','vaccinations'] ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_wordcount_in_dataframe(df1, df2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Getting index from df1 and finding wordcount with same index in df2.\n    \"\"\"\n    l=[]\n    for index, row in df1.iterrows():\n        try:\n            l.append(df2.loc[index,:])\n        except:\n            data = {'vaccine':0,'vaccination':0,'vaccines':0,'vaccinations':0}\n            s = pd.Series(data,dtype='int64',name=index)\n            l.append(s)\n    df3 = pd.DataFrame(l)\n    return df3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"DF_list = list()\n\nlimit = 1\na,b = get_word_count(targets,df_abstract,'abstract','paper_id')\npaper_word_distribution1 = get_word_distribution(b,limit)\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(paper_word_distribution1, orient='index')\n\n#vaccine had the highest count among the target words hence sorted in descending order by vaccine\ndf1 = df1.sort_values(by='vaccine', ascending=False)\ndisplay('Table 1 :Count of target words in abstracts')\ndisplay(df1[0:10])\n#considering only first 5 values of this list for better plotting\nDF_list.append(df1[0:10])\n\nc,d = get_word_count(targets,df_abstract,'full_text','paper_id')\npaper_word_distribution2 = get_word_distribution(d,limit)\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(paper_word_distribution2, orient='index')\ndf2 = df2.sort_values(by='vaccine', ascending=False)\ndisplay('Table 2: Count of target words in full_text')\ndisplay(df2[0:10])\n\ndisplay('Table 3: Count of target words in full text for papers in Table 1')\ndf3 = get_wordcount_in_dataframe(df1[0:10], df2)\ndisplay(df3)\nDF_list.append(df3)\n\nplot_clustered_stacked(DF_list, cmap=plt.cm.Set2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I then proceed to do the comparison the other way round i.e. I considered papers where the target words have occured frequently in the full-text section and then checked their frequency in the abstract section of the paper.
