To further improve their experience with this product, we try to personalize it to their needs. For this we have to look up at their past interactions with this product.\n\n*In one line* -> **Specialized content for everyone.**\n\n*For further info, [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#:~:text=A%20recommender%20system%2C%20or%20a,would%20give%20to%20an%20item.)*\n\nHere we will learn the foll.\n\n* 1.
