The generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to keep from being fooled. Using this architecture GANs can create images that resemble the training set.

We will use the dataset provided by https://www.kaggle.com/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types. \n\nWe will create a `tf.data.Dataset` as this appears to be the fastest solution. I have previously tried `tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory` and although this makes things simpler and has built in augementation it became a bottleneck for the GAN. It is not necessarly important to understand what is happening here but I will explain anyway. We load up images from the input folder, allow caching (for GPU), prefetching (so we do not have to loadup data just in time), tell the dataset to use batching and apply preprocessing and filtering.\n\n### Preprocessing\nImages are loaded up as RGB (or grayscale if `IMAGE_CHANNELS = 1`), scaled to `[IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE]` and each image channel is transformed from $[0, 255]$ to $[-1, 1]$. The images are now stored as a matrix of shape `[IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_CHANNELS]`.\n\n### Filtering\nWe kick out all images that have a white background (ca. 10%). This decreases our already quite small dataset to 721 images but also prevents color bleeding and improves convergence. We detect images with a white background by simply checking the red channel of the top left pixel - this will be a bad estimate in most cases but works well for this dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.data.experimental import AUTOTUNE\nimport glob\nimport imageio\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport PIL\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nimport time\nfrom IPython import display\n\nBATCH_SIZE = 128\nIMAGE_SIZE = 120  # reduce this to increase performance\nIMAGE_CHANNELS = 3  # can be 3 (RGB) or 1 (Grayscale)\nLATENT_SPACE_DIM = 100  # dimensions of the latent space that is used to generate the images\n\nassert IMAGE_SIZE % 4 == 0\n\n\ndef preprocess(file_path):\n    # load the raw data from the file as a string\n    img = tf.io.read_file(file_path)\n    # load the image as uint8 array and transform to grayscale\n    img = tf.image.decode_jpeg(img, channels=IMAGE_CHANNELS)\n    # resize the image to the desired size\n    img = tf.image.resize(img, [IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE])\n    # transform the color values from [0, 255] to [-1, 1].
