After 2 years another store of Supermarket Type-1,  was established in same location Tier-1 may be to boost sales in the region.\n\nAfter 3 years company thought of exploring new location, so set up Supermarket Type-1 in Tier-2. After 2 years another store of same type,  was established in same location may be to boost sales in the region. Maybe as this store had nearly good revenue as store no:27, in the same location, another store of Supermarket Type-1 was added to same location Tier-2. This time may be revenue decreased and company stopped establishing more stores till 2013.\n#### We can observe a pattern that the retail chain had habit of establishing new stores very often like within 1-2 years.
