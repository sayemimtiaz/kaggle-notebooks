Only 10/21 teams on the top 200 of both lists won it all.\n* Historic greatness on offense OR pitching/defense alone does not guarantee World Series wins. Four of the top five offenses failed to win the World Series. Four of the top five defensive/pitching teams failed to win it all.\n* Only 19 teams have won a World Series with below average runs scored or runs allowed. Most of those (16) had below average offense; only 3 won the World Series with a runs allowed metric worse than league average.\n\n**In short, baseball is hard and has lots of randomness -- regular season success does not guarantee a World Series win.**\n\n\n\nTo begin the analysis, the code below looks at some of the World Series winners with most and least **runs scored per game** and **runs allowed per game**:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/the-history-of-baseball/team.csv\")\n# modern era only (after 1900)\ndf = df[df[\"year\"]>1900]\n\nfor col in [\"w\", \"r\", \"ra\"]:\n    col_name = str(col + \"_per_game\")\n    df[col_name] = df[col] / df[\"g\"]\n\n# WS winners in the modern era (since 1900)\ndf_ws = df[df[\"ws_win\"]==\"Y\"]\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Runs Scored Per Game\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Runs Allowed Per Game\")\nplt.title(\"WS winners in the modern era\")\n\nplt.scatter(df_ws[\"r_per_game\"], df_ws[\"ra_per_game\"])\n\nplt.annotate('1936 NY Yankees', xy=(6.87, 4.7), xycoords='data', xytext=(6.5, 4.25), size=10, color=\"navy\", arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"simple\",fc=\"0\", ec=\"none\"))\nplt.annotate('1916 Boston Red Sox', xy=(3.5, 3.07), xycoords='data', xytext=(2.5, 2.7), size=10, color=\"navy\", arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"simple\",fc=\"0\", ec=\"none\"))\nplt.annotate('2000 NY Yankees', xy=(5.41, 5.06), xycoords='data', xytext=(6, 5), size=10, color=\"navy\", arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"simple\",fc=\"0\", ec=\"none\"))\nplt.annotate('1907 Chicago Cubs', xy=(3.7, 2.5), xycoords='data', xytext=(4.25, 2.5), size=10, color=\"navy\", arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"simple\",fc=\"0\", ec=\"none\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Hitting and pitching performance relative to league\n\nRather than the absolute metrics above, we now look at runs scored and runs allowed *relative* to the league average in a given year.
