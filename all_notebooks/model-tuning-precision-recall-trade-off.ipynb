Precision-Recall trade off\n\nThere is a trade off taking place here; would we rather have high precision, where our predictions of positive cases are very accurate but perhaps a few actual true cases are missed, or would we rather have high recall, in which very few actual true cases are missed?\n\nThis is called the **Precision - Recall trade off**, and the answer depends on our data set/situation. If we think about the dataset we are dealing with, missing a case of heart disease and leaving that patient untreated is probably worse than calling a few extra people back who don't have heart disease but who the model would flag up; we are willing to accept more false positives than false negatives. Here therefore, we would rather have high recall than high precision. \n\n\nBut how do we change the number of false positives/false negatives our model produces? Ultimately, our logistic regression estimated for each patient, how likely it was that there was heart disease present. The default decision boundary is 0.5; if the model considers the probabilty of heart disease being present to be > 50%, it will classify as true, if < 50% it will classify as false. By changing this decision boundary, we will change the number of false positives and false negatives, and hence the values of precision and recall.\n\n## 5. Plotting the Precision-Recall Curve\n\nWe can actually plot the values of precision and recall our model will produce for every value of the decision boundary.

ROC curves and AUC (area under curve)\n\nPrecision-Recall curves are useful, but not the only way we can assess our model's performance. We can also plot what is known as an ROC curve, which essentially plots:\n* **false positive rate** (how many patients falsely predicted as positive out of all actually negative cases: FP/TN + FP) \n\nagainst the\n\n* **true positive rate** (same as recall - out of all actually true cases how many did we accurately predict: TP/TP + FN)\n\nLike with the precision recall trade off, we can calculate our false positive and true positive rate for every value of the decision boundary and plot this as a curve.

Model tuning with Grid Search\n\nWe can use GridSearch to see how changing parameters in the model impacts accuracy, precision, and recall scores. \n\nTo illustrate I am going to fit a non-linear support vector to the model.

Essentially, this impacts how complex our decision boundaries will be; low gamma means a high similarity radias (points far apart are considered similar), resulting in smoother boundaries, whilst high gamma means points further apart are considered less similar, leading to more complex decision boundaries. \n\nI am going to use GridSearch to find the value of parameter Gamma which optimises for overall accuracy, then precision, then recall.
