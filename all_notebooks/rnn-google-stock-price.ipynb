{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Recurrent Neural Network is a generalization of a feed-forward neural network with internal memory. Well, ‘recurrent’ sounds complicated and they indeed are. They exhibit temporal dynamic behavior with a sequence dependence. That means RNNs have got to do something with regular or irregular time-based information retrieval over a period of time where the current information is influenced by the previous one in the memory. Most widely known RNNs are Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs). Please Refer LSTMs for detailed info. \n\nWhile trying to predict the Stock market trends, one must understand that future stock price is not dependent on past stock prices. Yet, by using the RNNs we can extract the time-based patterns (irregular or regular) for a certain period to evaluate the future expectation of stock being bullish or bearish. There could be various ways of prediction based on the features we choose. For example, analysis of GoogleTrend search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance, published in Scientific Reports, suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets. For our understanding, we will only focus on time-series learning using LSTMs.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0b3ea4ab-12c7-4cec-bea2-60e4a2f2f758","_cell_guid":"d20589b5-6005-48b6-ab6e-c3e870b83166","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\"\"\"\nCreated on Thu Jun 18 06:56:31 2020\n\n@author: G.Varchaleswari\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pt\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport pandas as pd\n\n#%%import the data\nstock_data = pd.read_csv('../input/google-stock-price/Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv')\ndata_train = stock_data.iloc[:,1:2]\ndata_train = np.array(data_train)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\n#%%feature scaling\nmsc = MinMaxScaler()\ndata_train = msc.fit_transform(data_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Data preparation for the LSTM network includes time steps. Some sequence problems may have a varied number of time steps per sample. You may have certain features of a dataset determining its relevant outcome. For example, a player's victory or loss in a game is contingent on the number of moves and the type of moves he does in the game, Each move would be a sample of the observations that lead up to the event and that would be the time steps, and the variables observed would be the features (types and number of moves). Instead of feeding the past observations as separate input features, we can use them as time steps of one input feature. This helps the RNN to build its internal memory.\n\nThe choice of the number of timesteps to implement depends on the learning rate and loss values of the algorithm. We want the loss to be minimized but not as much as to 0.0 percent as this may lead to overfitting. By experimenting with the number of time steps, 60 seemed most effective in my case. \n\nThe code below runs a for loop with the range of input data with 60 intervals for training each value where one time step is one point of observation in the sample.
