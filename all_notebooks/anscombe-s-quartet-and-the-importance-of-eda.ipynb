Here is a classic example, known as *'Anscombe's quartet'*, as to just why the use of graphical techniques to inspect the data before proceeding with any further action, such as [feature selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection) etc. is so crucial.\nThis notebook reproduces the four [scatter plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot) as well as the regression analysis of the data provided in the famous paper by the statistician [Frank J. Anscombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Anscombe) titled [\"Graphs in Statistical Analysis\"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1973.10478966) which was published in 1973.\n\nFirst we shall perform an [ordinary least squares regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression) on the aforementioned [four sets of data points](https://www.kaggle.com/carlmcbrideellis/data-anscombes-quartet). The model that we use is that of a straight line; $ y = mx + c $, where $m$ represents the slope and $c$ is the intercept on the $y$-axis.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\n\n# read in the csv file containing the data\nquartet_data = pd.read_csv('../input/data-anscombes-quartet/Anscombe_quartet_data.csv')\n\n# Figure 1 fit:\nx1 = quartet_data['x123']\ny1 = quartet_data['y1']\nm1,c1 = np.polyfit(x1, y1, 1)\n# Figure 2 fit:\nx2 = quartet_data['x123']\ny2 = quartet_data['y2']\nm2,c2 = np.polyfit(x2, y2, 1)\n# Figure 3 fit:\nx3 = quartet_data['x123']\ny3 = quartet_data['y3']\nm3,c3 = np.polyfit(x3, y3, 1)\n# Figure 4 fit:\nx4 = quartet_data['x4']\ny4 = quartet_data['y4']\nm4,c4 = np.polyfit(x4, y4, 1)\n# plot all four plots in a multiplot:\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, sharex=True, sharey=True, figsize=(18,9))\nplt.xlim(3,20)\nplt.ylim(2,14)\naxs[0, 0].set_title('Figure 1', fontsize=16)\naxs[0, 0].plot(x1, y1, 'yo', x1, m1*x1+c1) \naxs[0, 1].set_title('Figure 2', fontsize=16)\naxs[0, 1].plot(x2, y2, 'yo', x2, m2*x2+c2)\naxs[1, 0].set_title('Figure 3', fontsize=16)\naxs[1, 0].plot(x3, y3, 'yo', x3, m3*x3+c3) \naxs[1, 1].set_title('Figure 4', fontsize=16)\naxs[1, 1].plot(x4, y4, 'yo', x4, m4*x4+c4);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that:\n\n* In Figure 1 the points almost lie along a straight line, and that our straight line model seems to be a reasonable choice.\n* In Figure 2 the points would really be better fitted by a smooth curve, such as a quadratic model (i.e. $y = ax^2 + mx +c$).\n* In Figure 3 we see an outlier point, whose removal from the data set would result in a much better fit.\n* In Figure 4 we see that outcome variables are completely independent of the explanatory variable, and a regression is only possible because of one single point, in this case it is a 'high-leverage' point, i.e. this point is exerting a large (or in this case total) influence on the slope of the fit.\n\nHowever, we can see form the Table below that all the simple 'descriptive' statistical properties, for each of the four plots, are **almost exactly the same** (Note that I have deliberately printed all of the available significant figures to show just how well this example data set was designed).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# mean values (x-bar)\nx1_mean = quartet_data['x123'].mean()\nx4_mean = quartet_data['x4'].mean()\n# y-bar\ny1_mean = quartet_data['y1'].mean()\ny2_mean = quartet_data['y2'].mean()\ny3_mean = quartet_data['y3'].mean()\ny4_mean = quartet_data['y4'].mean()\n\n# Sum of squares of x -
