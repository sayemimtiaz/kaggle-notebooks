It lets you scale QA models to large collections of documents! You can read more about this amazing library here https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack\n\nFor installation: ! `pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git`\n\nBut just to give a background, there are 3 major components to `Haystack`.\n\n**Document Store**: Database storing the documents for our search. We recommend `Elasticsearch`, but have also more light-weight options for fast prototyping (SQL or In-Memory).\n\n**Retriever**: Fast, simple algorithm that identifies candidate passages from a large collection of documents. Algorithms include `TF-IDF` or `BM25`, custom `Elasticsearch` queries, and embedding-based approaches. The Retriever helps to narrow down the scope for Reader to smaller units of text where a given question could be answered.\n\n**Reader**: Powerful neural model that reads through texts in detail to find an answer. Use diverse models like `BERT`, `RoBERTa` or `XLNet` trained via `FARM` or `Transformers` on SQuAD like tasks. The Reader takes multiple passages of text as input and returns top-n answers with corresponding confidence scores. You can just load a pretrained model from Hugging Face's model hub or fine-tune it to your own domain data.\n\nAnd then there is **Finder** which glues together a **Reader** and a **Retriever** as a pipeline to provide an easy-to-use question answering interface.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# installing haystack\n\n! pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing necessary dependencies\n\nfrom haystack import Finder\nfrom haystack.indexing.cleaning import clean_wiki_text\nfrom haystack.indexing.utils import convert_files_to_dicts, fetch_archive_from_http\nfrom haystack.reader.farm import FARMReader\nfrom haystack.reader.transformers import TransformersReader\nfrom haystack.utils import print_answers","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setting up DocumentStore\n`Haystack` finds answers to queries within the documents stored in a `DocumentStore`.
