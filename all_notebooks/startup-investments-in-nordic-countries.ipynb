At face level, this sounds like a obvious description, but we were interested in digging deeper into the data relating to the industries that could possibly employ us and funders that could possibly finance any startup ideas of ours.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing necessary Python packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Challenges of the dataset and Jupyter collaboration**\n- The dataset is fairly large at 39 columns and 50k rows, so we knew a lot of the data would not readily serve our purposes. Also there was some data that would be redundant for us, duplicating date data etc. This we would tackle in our choices tof focus on a subset of countries and columns as well as in the clean up stage. \n- In researching collaboration methods for our group, we landed on using Google's Colab tools, which is an online Jupyter environment linked to your Google account. We used this, Hangouts and Whatsapp for communication and had set up a Google Slides doc in case we had to present in Powerpoint/Slides format. \n- Although Colab has proven to be reliable, there have been some hiccups and therefore, we mainly used our Colab Jupyter document as a central repository of our current/overnight work as well as a sketchbook while meeting in Google Hangouts. We did our main data analysis on our own Jupyter environments on our computers. \n- Another thing to note about Colab: we stored our Colab work in Dmitry's Google Drive, which required frequent authentication for every user, so to solve this issue, the CSV file was moved to a website (dmitrytolonen.com in the read_csv cell), as this avoided the authentication issue and allowed everyone better access to the work file. \n- Finally, the dataset lacked some data to which we would have liked to have access, such as more data about the entities making acquisitions, whether they were large, rich countries such as the US, China etc. or whether the Nordic IP remained in the region (with its potential employment and taxation ramifications).\n​"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None\npd.set_option('display.max_column',None)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"investments = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/startup-investments-crunchbase/investments_VC.csv', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Focusing our study: Startup investment in the Nordic countries**\n\nOk, let's get to work!

**Cleanup and collaboration** \n- Online collaboration tools are only as strong as their weakest link: in Google Colab’s case, if all participants have full editing access to a file, but Colab keeps asking for authorisation, you need to start hacking solutions. \n- Try not to change software, tools, platforms or update py modules in the middle of a project, it may cause problems or change your output in unexpected ways. \n\n\n\n2) **Status, scale and market segments**\n- We can see that there is still a significantly larger volume of startups coming out of Sweden than Finland, and that the startups are largely driven by the software, biotech and mobile market segments. Certain large companies such as Spotify and Supercell account for a large part of this.\n- The ratio of acquired startups (in 'status') to the total seems to be lower than one would expect based on the public perception of fast-moving startup culture.\n- The top 5 funded startups can be found in entertainment (Spotify leading the way), biotech (Symphogen), payments (Klarna), clean technology (NorSun), and games (Supercell).\n- according to our data, startup formation has had two spikes in 2006 and 2012.  \n\n\n3) **Public grants, debt and Finland**\n- It is likely that taxation and incentives would play a part in investment. Unfortunately, this didn't form a part of our dataset, but is a worthy area of research in the future. Here, a comparison of neighbouring countries could yield an understanding e.g. of Finland's place in the startup investment arena.\n- There were 11 startups each in the categories of Mobile and Software, and 7 in Biotech, with a higher than 1 million USD investment in the Finnish market. By comparison, the Nordic figures put the number of startups with over 1 million USD investment at 50 startups (Software), 46 startups (Biotech) and 32 (Mobile). We can see that the Nordic figures reveal a higher focus on the Biotech segment than in Finland.\n- Startups seem to take more debt than receive grants in Finland, although the main investment type is still venture capital, and those grants are focused mostly in the Helsinki region, with Oulu coming in second and Turku third. The further we move into the periphery, the fewer the grants in an industry that is built on decentralisation.  \n \n\n4) **Success stories, funding rounds and private funding**\n\n- Data for interesting questions related to who is acquiring startups was thin. Yes, there was data related to how many startups had been acquired, but we would need further research to understand better the retention of IP in the Nordic countries or Finland.\n- To this end, we would have liked to take advantage of such additional data to employ Machine Learning techniques for predictions of trends in startup investment.\n- We can see that, overall,  just over a quarter of startups got seed funding, which is slightly higher in Finland at 39.7 percent. Only Iceland has a higher share of startups receiving seed funding at 43.8 percent. \n- When it comes to venture capital funding, however, Iceland is the lowest at 25 percent with Finland (48.5 percent) sitting roughly at the Nordic average of 46.9 percent. \n- Angel funding accounts for 8.9 percent for the Nordic countries, with most companies in this area - Finland sits at 8.2 percent.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
