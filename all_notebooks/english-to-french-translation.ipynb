Instead, you'll convert the text into sequences of integers using the following preprocess methods:\n1. Tokenize the words into ids\n2. Add padding to make all the sequences the same length.\n\nTime to start preprocessing the data...\n### Tokenize (IMPLEMENTATION)\nFor a neural network to predict on text data, it first has to be turned into data it can understand. Text data like \"dog\" is a sequence of ASCII character encodings.  Since a neural network is a series of multiplication and addition operations, the input data needs to be number(s).\n\nWe can turn each character into a number or each word into a number.  These are called character and word ids, respectively.  Character ids are used for character level models that generate text predictions for each character.  A word level model uses word ids that generate text predictions for each word.  Word level models tend to learn better, since they are lower in complexity, so we'll use those.\n\nTurn each sentence into a sequence of words ids using Keras's [`Tokenizer`](https://keras.io/preprocessing/text/#tokenizer) function.
