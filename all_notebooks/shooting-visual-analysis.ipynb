The 3 has become so ingrained into the modern game that the traditional positions don't really encapsulate the different classes of players anymore. For example, look at these players who are both classified as power forwards: \n- Davis Bertans, who shot 8.7 of his 11.3 shots/game from 3-point range\n- Domantas Sabonis, who shot 1.1 of his 13.7 shots/game from 3\n\nOr, look at these rival, star point guards:\n- Damian Lillard - 10.2 of 20.4 shots/game from 3\n- Russell Westbrook - 3.7 of 22.5 shots/game from 3\n\nSo does it really make much sense to lump these sets of highly contrasting players into the same position when the way they score - and fundamentally, the way they play - is so different? To me, a position is meant to label a player's style of playing and how they contribute to the team. Think about positions in football (soccer): the positions roughly denote the location on the pitch that a player predominantly fills and controls. If we really think about it, this already exist at some level in basketball; some players are pretty exclusively 3-point shooters, waiting on the perimeter for spot-up looks, other players might be purely interior lob threats, etc. \n\nI think it would be neat to consider a roughly equivalent position system in basketball. That leads us to the next part of this project, which aims to boil down the different shooting tendencies of players into new categories, redefining the notion of positions in NBA basketball."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
