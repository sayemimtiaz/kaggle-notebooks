We will be using Logistic Regression for classification purposes since it's good at text-classifying. Data used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).\n\nThe data is split into two datasets, containing 44898 articles in total. The columns include:\n\n* title: Contains the title of each article.\n* text: Contains the context of each article.\n* subject: Contains the subject of each article.\n* date: Contains the date each article was posted in a Month DD, YYYY format.\n\n## 1.

In the meanwhile, real news articles belong into either one of these categories: \"Politics\" and \"World\". Both real and fake articles have many articles in \"Politics\" category. \n\n## 4. Further Preprocessing\n\nBefore we move on to the classification, we will be working on the data further.\n\nOur first step will be dropping some data. We will drop articles that were released before 2016 because there are no real news articles in that period, therefore, the data is not representative enough. Talking about representation, we will also be dropping articles from subjects \"Government\", \"Left\", \"Middle East\" and \"US\". That's because the only common subject both fake and real articles have is \"Politics\" and we will be dropping too much data if we drop articles with \"All\" and \"World\" subjects. Also, their frequencies and names also indicate that the \"All\" subject for fake articles might be the equivalent of the \"World\" subject in real news.
