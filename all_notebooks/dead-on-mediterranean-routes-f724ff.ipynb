In cases where the exact date of death is not known, this variable indicates the date in which the body or bodies were found. In cases where data are drawn from surviving migrants, witnesses or other interviews, this variable is entered as the date of the death as reported by the interviewee.  At a minimum, the month and the year of death is recorded. In some cases, official statistics are not disaggregated by the incident, meaning that data is reported as a total number of deaths occurring during a certain time period. In such cases the entry is marked as a “cumulative total,” and the latest date of the range is recorded, with the full dates recorded in the comments.\n|Reported year|The year in which the incident occurred.\n|Reported month|The month in which the incident occurred.\n|Number dead|The total number of people confirmed dead in one incident, i.e. the number of bodies recovered.  If migrants are missing and presumed dead, such as in cases of shipwrecks, leave blank.\n|Number missing |The total number of those who are missing and are thus assumed to be dead.  This variable is generally recorded in incidents involving shipwrecks.  The number of missing is calculated by subtracting the number of bodies recovered from a shipwreck and the number of survivors from the total number of migrants reported to have been on the boat.  This number may be reported by surviving migrants or witnesses.  If no missing persons are reported, it is left blank.\n|Total dead and missing|The sum of the ‘number dead’ and ‘number missing’ variables.\n|Number of survivors|The number of migrants that survived the incident, if known. The age, gender, and country of origin of survivors are recorded in the ‘Comments’ variable if known. If unknown, it is left blank\n|Number of females|Indicates the number of females found dead or missing. If unknown, it is left blank.\n|Number of males|Indicates the number of males found dead or missing. If unknown, it is left blank.\n|Number of children|Indicates the number of individuals under the age of 18 found dead or missing. If unknown, it is left blank.\n|Country of origin|Country of birth of the decedent. If unknown, the entry will be marked “unknown”.\n|Region of origin|Region of origin of the decedent(s). In some incidents, region of origin may be marked as “Presumed” or “(P)” if migrants travelling through that location are known to hail from a certain region. If unknown, the entry will be marked “unknown”.\n|Cause of death|The determination of conditions resulting in the migrant's death i.e. the circumstances of the event that produced the fatal injury. If unknown, the reason why is included where possible.  For example, “Unknown – skeletal remains only”, is used in cases in which only the skeleton of the decedent was found.\n|Location description|Place where the death(s) occurred or where the body or bodies were found. Nearby towns or cities or borders are included where possible. When incidents are reported in an unspecified location, this will be noted.\n|Location coordinates|Place where the death(s) occurred or where the body or bodies were found. In many regions, most notably the Mediterranean, geographic coordinates are estimated as precise locations are not often known. The location description should always be checked against the location coordinates.\n|Migration route|Name of the migrant route on which incident occurred, if known. If unknown, it is left blank.\n|UNSD geographical grouping|Geographical region in which the incident took place, as designated by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) geoscheme.\n|Source quality|Incidents are ranked on a scale from 1-5 based on the source(s) of information available. Incidents ranked as level 1 are based on information from only one media source. Incidents ranked as level 2 are based on information from uncorroborated eyewitness accounts or data from survey respondents. Incidents ranked as level 3 are based on information from multiple media reports, while level 4 incidents are based on information from at least one NGO, IGO, or another humanitarian actor with direct knowledge of the incident. Incidents ranked at level 5 are based on information from official sources such as coroners, medical examiners, or government officials OR from multiple humanitarian actors.\n|Comments|Brief description narrating additional facts about the death.  If no extra information is available, this is left blank."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### BIBLIO BY COURSERA:\n#### 1) http://missingmigrants.iom.int/methodology\n#### 2) https://missingmigrants.iom.int/regional-classifications\n#### 3) https://www.iom.int/\n#### 4) https://gmdac.iom.int/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
