However, it can do more than load and transform your data: it can visualize it too! Indeed, the easy-to-use and expressive pandas plotting API is a big part of `pandas` popularity.\n\nIn this section we will learn the basic `pandas` plotting facilities, starting with the simplest type of visualization: single-variable or \"univariate\" visualizations.

An interval variable goes beyond an ordinal categorical variable: it has a *meaningful* order, in the sense that we can quantify what the difference between two entries is itself an interval variable.\n\nFor example, if I say that this sample of water is -20 degrees Celcius, and this other sample is 120 degrees Celcius, then I can quantify the difference between them: 140 degrees \"worth\" of heat, or such-and-such many joules of energy.\n\nThe difference can be qualitative sometimes. At a minimum, being able to state something so clearly feels a lot more \"measured\" than, say, saying you'll buy this wine and not that one, because this one scored a 92 on some taste test and that one only got an 85. More definitively, any variable that has infinitely many possible values is definitely an interval variable (why not 120.1 degrees? 120.001? 120.0000000001? Etc).\n\nLine charts work well for interval data. Bar charts don't—unless your ability to measure it is very limited, interval data will naturally vary by quite a lot.\n\nLet's apply a new tool, the histogram, to an interval variable in our dataset, price (we'll cut price off at 200$ a bottle; more on why shortly)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c8dbf164-a024-47c6-b0e7-5b1109f815a0","_uuid":"4ebe0e7312ed0a8c3d58f9740148de43843cbb16"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Histograms\n\nHere's a histogram:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4cd3fac2-0eeb-4519-8d66-348c0994b3d3","_uuid":"489e41a20bb5ecbbf29fb02f912fc74bc0dd0c66","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews[reviews['price'] < 200]['price'].plot.hist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"03058fba-c1ec-4263-97e0-ac2500f604d3","_uuid":"747d3a4ab5b14ce8a86c41d6086b3f3453052e2a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A histogram looks, trivially, like a bar plot.
