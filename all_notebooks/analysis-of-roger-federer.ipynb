At the point of 2020 May, he holds the highest number of grandslam titles, 20. I, myself, as a tennis player and a data scientist, would like to analyze his performance throughout his career from year 2000-2017 using the data from this file.\n\n\nI personally has been watching his play since 15 years ago and I have noticed a noticable improvement in his playing styles, including his serve, his forehand, his backhand, and his volley etc. However, most players have been probably improving themselves as well so this does not mean that Roger will remain the strongest of all time. We will look at the statistics to answer the following points.\n\n### Outline \n\n1. **Roger's Overall Performance**\n    We will also look whether he finishes the matches with fewere number of games or not.\n\n2. **Roger's Serve Performance**\n    We will see whether his serve improves overall by looking at his number of aces throughout the years. It is true that this might not accurately indicate his performance as most players are getting better and better all the time due to various reasons such as the advancement in technology, sport science, as well as food. However, we could see whether Roger has improved beyond other players or not.\n\n3. **Roger's Mentality**\n    We will look at his mentality according to the number of breakpoints he accomplised overtime.\n4. **Roger's Opponenets** \n    Here we will see who did Roger win and loss against the most.\n\n**Timeline**\nThis data in this data set includes all the matches from 2000 to 2017 (until January). Therefore, the information in 2017 might not well represent the entire year's data.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setting up","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n        for filename in filenames:\n            print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Cleaning","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cols = [\n    'tourney_id', # Id of Tournament\n    'tourney_name', # Name of the Tournament\n    'surface', # Surface of the Court (Hard, Clay, Grass)\n    'draw_size', # Number of people in the tournament\n    'tourney_level', # Level of the tournament (A=ATP Tour, D=Davis Cup, G=Grand Slam, M=Masters)\n    'tourney_date', # Start date of tournament\n    'match_num', # Match number\n    'winner_id', # Id of winner\n    'winner_seed', # Seed of winner\n    'winner_entry', # How the winner entered the tournament\n    'winner_name', # Name of winner\n    'winner_hand', # Dominant hand of winner (L=Left, R=Right, U=Unknown?)\n    'winner_ht', # Height in cm of winner\n    'winner_ioc', # Country of winner\n    'winner_age', # Age of winner\n    'winner_rank', # Rank of winner\n    'winner_rank_points', # Rank points of winner\n    'loser_id',\n    'loser_seed',\n    'loser_entry',\n    'loser_name',\n    'loser_hand',\n    'loser_ht',\n    'loser_ioc',\n    'loser_age',\n    'loser_rank',\n    'loser_rank_points',\n    'score', # Score\n    'best_of', # Best of X number of sets\n    'round', # Round\n    'minutes', # Match length in minutes\n    'w_ace', # Number of aces for winner\n    'w_df', # Number of double faults for winner\n    'w_svpt', # Number of service points played by winner\n    'w_1stIn', # Number of first serves in for winner\n    'w_1stWon', # Number of first serve points won for winner\n    'w_2ndWon', # Number of second serve points won for winner\n    'w_SvGms', # Number of service games played by winner\n    'w_bpSaved', # Number of break points saved by winner\n    'w_bpFaced', # Number of break points faced by winner\n    'l_ace',\n    'l_df',\n    'l_svpt',\n    'l_1stIn',\n    'l_1stWon',\n    'l_2ndWon',\n    'l_SvGms',\n    'l_bpSaved',\n    'l_bpFaced'\n]\n\ndf = pd.concat([\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2000.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2001.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2002.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2003.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2004.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2005.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2006.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2007.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2008.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2009.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2010.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2011.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2012.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2013.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2014.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2015.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2016.csv', usecols=cols),\n    pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/atp-matches-dataset/atp_matches_2017.csv', usecols=cols),\n],ignore_index=True) #have to make sure that the index will not be duplicated\n\ndf.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since we are doing solely an analysis of Roger Federer, we only need the rows with roger federer in it.
