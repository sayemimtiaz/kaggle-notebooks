The customer would like to know the likelihood of predicting whether it rains or not on a specific day by using MLAs.\n\n- The input variables (predictors) are Date, PRCP, TMAX, and TMIN. The last three are numerical continuous variables.\n\n- The outcome or dependent variable is: RAIN (boolean)\n\n- I will use knowledge and experience in the field of Atmospheric Science to improve the methodology, but an in-depth use of science is not possible in this framework.\n\n- In part 1, I  only used the available predictors (as they are) and dropped the ones that are not independent. That way, I reached an accuracy score of 68%.\n\n- Here, (part 2), I will perform advanced feature engineering and will extract new variables based on the available predictors in order to improve the accuracy score.\n\n----\nVariable 'PRCP' (precipitation amount) should be used with caution:\n\nCorrect use of PRCP as a predictor: \n\n1) We know PRCP in the last few days (e.g. 1-3 Jan.). How can that help predict 'RAIN' (binary rain: did it rain or not) for today (e.g. 4 Jan.)?\n\n2) We know the PRCP for 4 Jan. for all the previous years 1948-2017. Can we use this data to predict 'RAIN' for 4 Jan. 2018?\n\nWrong use of PRCP:\n\nWe know PRCP for 4 Jan. 2018. Can we use it to predict 'RAIN' for 4 Jan. 2018?\n\nThis is cheating: MLA would provide a perfect answer when the outcome is included among the predictors: when MLA knows the amount of precipitation on a specific day, it can certainly say whether it rains or not. \n\nNote that the other solutions to this problem, that I found on this website, did this mistake and kept the variable PRCP to predict RAIN. This motivated me to provide a better methodology.\n\n \n\n### Importing important libraries:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sb\nimport os\n\nfrom pandas import Series, DataFrame\nfrom pylab import rcParams\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\n\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB, BernoulliNB\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reading the data:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"met_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/did-it-rain-in-seattle-19482017/seattleWeather_1948-2017.csv')\nprint(met_df.head()); print(); print()\nmet_df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The description and unit of each variable:\n- DATE = the date of the observation\n- PRCP = the amount of precipitation, in inches\n- TMAX = the maximum temperature for that day, in degrees Fahrenheit\n- TMIN = the minimum temperature for that day, in degrees Fahrenheit\n- RAIN = TRUE if rain was observed on that day, FALSE if it was not"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Cleaing:\n\n### Step 1: Correcting wrong values or outliers:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"met_df.describe(include = 'all')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data description makes sense, and the mean, min, and max values of each variable is reasonable meaning there should not be a mistake in the data (such as a very large temperature of 200 F)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Step 2: Imputing missing values:\n\nThere are only three missing data points for each PRCP and RAIN.

I can think of (T_DIFF = TMAX - TMIN); and (T_RATIO = TMAX / TMIN). These new variables should have a higher correlation with 'RAIN', because when it rains there is less fluctuation in the daily change of Temperature, and TMAX and TMIN get closer. Therefore, T_DIFF (T_RATIO) becomes smaller (larger). This theory will be tested later. I will only use T_RATIO in this demo.\n- It takes about a week for a meteorological weather system to pass over a certain location. Consider a system is causing rain over Seattle for a week. I simply assume the average state, meaning that today is the 4th rainy day due to this system. In other words, the last 3 days were rainy and the next 3 days will also be rainy. So, I conclude that if I know the PRCP in the past 3 days, I can predict the RAIN for today. Therefore, I extract a variable \"average precipitation in the past n days\" (PRCP_n) where n = 3. For example, I know the average PRCP for 1-3 Jan. 2017. What is the predicted RAIN for Jan. 4 2017?\n- Imagine today is 4 Jan. 2018. If 4 Jan. was rainy in all previous years, there is a good chance that it will rain today. I would like to use average PRCP for 4 Jan. from 1948 to 2017 and predict RAIN for today. So, I calculate a new variable daily_PRCP (average PRCP on a specific day for all years)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## T_RATIO\nT_RATIO =  met_df.TMIN / met_df.TMAX\nT_RATIO[T_RATIO > 1]  = 1 #correcting an error in initial data where TMIN > TMAX\n\n## PRCP in the past n days (here, n = 3)\nn = 3\nPRCP_n = np.empty(len(met_df.PRCP))\nPRCP_n[:] = 0\nPRCP_n = [sum(met_df.PRCP.values[i-n:i]) / n for i in range(n, len(met_df.PRCP.values))]\n\n## daily PRCP\nfrom datetime import datetime\nDoY_str = met_df.DATE.dt.strftime('%j')\nDay_of_Year = [int(a) for a in DoY_str]\n#group data based on \"day of year\"\ngroupD     = met_df.groupby(Day_of_Year)\nDoY_PRCP   = groupD['PRCP'].mean()  # daily climatological mean PRCP\ndaily_PRCP = [DoY_PRCP[a] for a in Day_of_Year]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Add all these new variables to DataFrame:\nT_RATIO_df     = pd.DataFrame(T_RATIO,     columns = ['T_RATIO'])\nPRCP_n_df      = pd.DataFrame(PRCP_n,      columns = ['PRCP_n'])\ndaily_PRCP_df  = pd.DataFrame(daily_PRCP,  columns = ['daily_PRCP'])\n\nmet_new_df = pd.concat([met_df['DATE'],met_df['PRCP'],PRCP_n_df,daily_PRCP_df,\n                        met_df['TMAX'],met_df['TMIN'],T_RATIO_df,met_df['RAIN']], axis = 1)\n\nmet_new_df.PRCP_n.fillna(met_new_df.PRCP.median(), inplace = True)\n\nmet_new_df.describe(include = 'all')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\nrcParams['figure.figsize'] = 10, 8\nsb.set_style('whitegrid')\n\nsb.pairplot(met_new_df, palette = 'husl', hue = 'RAIN')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 10, 8\nsb.heatmap(met_new_df.corr(), vmin=-1, vmax=1, annot=True, cmap = 'RdBu_r')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- It seems that the new variabels extracted via feature engineering have high correlation with RAIN.\n- Compared to TMAX or TMIN, T_RATIO (equals to TMAX / TMIN) has higher correlation with RAIN.\n- PRCP_n (average precipitation in the past n days, here n = 3) and daily_PRCP (average PRCP on a specific day for all years) also have relatively high correlations with RAIN."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axis = plt.subplots(2, 2,figsize=(12,10))\nsb.scatterplot(x = 'TMIN', y ='TMAX', data = met_new_df, hue = 'RAIN', ax = axis[0,0])\nsb.scatterplot(x = 'daily_PRCP', y ='T_RATIO', data = met_new_df, hue = 'RAIN', ax = axis[0,1])\nsb.scatterplot(x = 'daily_PRCP', y ='TMAX', data = met_new_df, hue = 'RAIN', ax = axis[1,0])\nsb.scatterplot(x = 'daily_PRCP', y ='TMIN', data = met_new_df, hue = 'RAIN', ax = axis[1,1])\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- As expected, TMAX and TMIN are not independent: this means that there are factors such as season, weather systems and sky cloudiness that affect both TMAX and TMIN.
