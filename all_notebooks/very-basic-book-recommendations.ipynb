Number of ratings and average rating should definitely be more informative feature than from the current dataset. Goodreads also specifies what genre a book is and also allows users to hashtag any book with any hashtag. These hashtag could also serve as additional info about books if they are properly grouped.\n\nGoodreads features:\n- Number of ratings\n- Average rating\n- Number of stars (it is different if a book always get 3 stars from everybody or if it gets fives and ones)\n- How many times was the page with the book visited?\n- Number of pages\n- Average reading time\n- Genre\n- Is part of series? How many books does the series have? What is the number of the book in series?\n- Hashtag groups\n- How many books did the author write?\n- Is the author popular? (number of followers)\n- Number of editions\n- Number of translations \n\n## Additional ideal data\nAsk user what kind of books do they like; ideally have a page with sliders for different kind of books (sci-fi, romance...). Perhaps ask them what kind of book would they want to read next. They could also check a type of recommendations. \n\nIdeal additional features:\n- How much does the user like sci-fi/romance..."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Possible models\n\nWith additional features listed above the most transparent model would be lightGBM or a different regression forest as it can output the importance of features. I would guess that a neural network where user and book features are encoded separately would give better results. I would find interesting using a RNN or different NN with memory as the reader's taste changes and it does not make sense to base predictions on books read twenty years ago."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
