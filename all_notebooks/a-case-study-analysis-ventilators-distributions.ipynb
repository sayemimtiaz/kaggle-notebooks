And when does this occur in their disease course?\n\nBut why ventilators are important? Well if you get the disease and present serious symptoms those equipaments would be necessary to help you breath. So it's important for a country to present a large number of ventilators (to prevent population death).\n\n## Modules"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Standard modules\nimport numpy as np\nimport warnings\n\n# Data modules\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Modelling modules\nfrom scipy import integrate\nfrom scipy import optimize\n\n# Plot modules\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.offline as pyo\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n# Notebook commands\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\npyo.init_notebook_mode()\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Case Study: Italy\n![italy-flag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32513366/80289653-5eef6900-8716-11ea-9e12-4e3681b34a59.jpg)\n\n## Why Italy?\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, many countries including european, did not consider the SARS-COV-2 virus to be harmful. Italy's situation can be considered as the first western shock and what has caused many countries to take action. Given this fact, I chose an in-depth study in Italy to show what the impacts would be on other countries if no action was taken."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Study assumptions\n\n## Ventilators\nBased in this reference from Imperial College:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32513366/80289717-d7562a00-8716-11ea-9c94-899bcb159bd0.png)\n\nI assume that:\n- at least 80% (from 10%) of hospitalized pacients will require ventilators\n- 100% of ICU patients will require ventilators\n- I will not evalute different ventilators i.e. I will evaluate only required units\n- I will assume that if a pacient require a ventilator and doesn't have it, he dies.\n\nGiven that, I will considerer that **13%**(5% from ICU patients + 8% from hospitalized patients) of my infected cases will require ventilators.\n\n\n## Mathematical approach\nIn the next section I show my modelling approach. To understand my results, I present my major assumption: I assume a **static** approach for this case study, which means that my calculated parameters will not change over time. Basically my results here present a specific scenario:\n\n### What would happen if Italy doesn't take any action after ending of March\n\nThis is important to say because most of the world are doing a **dynamic** approach:\n- Measure the curve by chosen parameters\n- Make predictions to understand better the techniques they need to apply such as isolation or lockdown\n- Apply a technique and study if your situation has improved\n- Evaluate if your model start to show higher errors compared to reality\n- Restart the circle"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# SEIR Model Explanation\n\nSEIR is a set (system) of ODE (Ordinary Differencial Equations) which models the dynamics of four main dependent variables over time during a pandemic:\n- **S(t)**: Suscetible cases - Population fraction that can get a disease\n- **E(t)**: Exposed cases - Population fraction that got the virus, but doesn't present any symptom\n- **I(t)**: Infected cases - As exposed, but presents any symptom\n- **R(t)**: Recovered cases - Population fraction that got infected and recovered after some time\n\nThe mathematical ODE system is presented bellow:\n![seir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32513366/80239696-101ed200-8637-11ea-8ace-918fb5d98076.PNG)\n\nThe dynamics between them are correlated and reminds SIR model. For more modelling information I strongly recommend the [MAA SIR reading](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model) and [Numberphile - The corona curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6nLfCbAzgo) to understand SIR model (it helps to understand this model too) and a [SEIR Model doc](http://www.public.asu.edu/~hnesse/classes/seir.html).\n\nIn red, I specify the parameters that control SEIR curves:\n- **er**: exposed rate\n- **ir**: infection rate\n- **rr**: recovery rate\n\nSo when you hear:\n\n### \"Flatten the Corona curve\" \n\nThe objective is to decrease **infection rate** to flatten the Infection curve. This is achieve by lockdown/isolation techniques.\n\nA higher **recovery rate** is desired too, because the number of people in hospitals tends to decrease.\n\n\nThis ODE system present your dependent variables (s, i, e and r) in lowercase. This statement is important because for my solution I evaluated fraction values related to population size (N):\n![SEIR_CR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32513366/80240551-65a7ae80-8638-11ea-8784-6edad80e0ba2.PNG)\n\n## But how I will develop this model?\nGiven the fact that I have:\n- A model approach: SEIR\n- Initial curves for Infected and Recovered cases in each state\n\nI will implement an **optimization technique** to find the actual parameters that minimize my error for both initial curves: i(t) and r(t).\n\n## Defined functions"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# FUNCTION - Define SEIR Model ODE System\ndef seir_model_ode(y, t, params): \n    '''\n    Arguments:\n    - y: dependent variables\n    - t: independent variable (time)\n    - params: Model params\n    '''\n    # Parameters to find\n    infection_rate = params[0]\n    recovery_rate = params[1]\n    exposed_rate = params[2]\n    \n    # Y variables\n    s = y[0]\n    e = y[1]\n    i = y[2]\n    r = y[3]\n    \n    # SEIR EDO System \n    dsdt = -exposed_rate*s*i\n    dedt = (exposed_rate*s*i) - (infection_rate*e)\n    didt = (infection_rate*e) - (recovery_rate*i)\n    drdt = recovery_rate*i\n    \n    # Return our system\n    return (dsdt, dedt, didt, drdt)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# FUNCTION - Calculate SEIR Model in t (time as days) based on given parameters\ndef calculate_seir_model(params, t, initial_condition):\n    # Create an alias to our ode model to pass guessed params\n    seir_ode = lambda y,t:seir_model_ode(y, t, params)\n    \n    # Calculate ode solution, return values to each\n    ode_result = integrate.odeint(func=seir_ode, y0=initial_condition, t=t)\n    \n    # Return results\n    return ode_result","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# FUNCTION - Auxiliar function to find the best parameters\ndef fit_seir_model(params_to_fit, t, initial_condition, i_r_true):\n    # Calculate ODE solution for possible parameter, return values to each dependent variable:\n    # (s, e, i and r)\n    fit_result = calculate_seir_model(params_to_fit, t, initial_condition)\n    \n    # Calculate residual value between predicted VS true\n    ## Note: ode_result[0] is S result\n    residual_i = i_r_true[0] - fit_result[:,2]\n    residual_r = i_r_true[1] - fit_result[:,3]\n\n    # Create a np.array of all residual values for both (i) and (r)\n    residual = np.concatenate((residual_i, residual_r))\n    \n    # Return results\n    return residual","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Proposed approach\nI will present a step-by-step understanding approach:\n- **Data pre-processing**\n    - Here I imported my dataset and turned it more clean to work\n- **Exploratory Data Analysis** \n    - Here I evaluated the most impacted region in Italy.
