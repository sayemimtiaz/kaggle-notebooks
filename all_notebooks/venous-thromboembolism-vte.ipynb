Lisa Baumann Kreuziger, Agnes Lee, David Garcia, Adam Cuker, Mary Cushman, Maria DeSancho, and Jean M. Connors\n\nThe incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients is not well established. Reports have ranged between 1.1% in non-ICU hospital wards to 69% in ICU patients screened with lower extremity ultrasound. Small sample sizes, differences in patient characteristics, co-morbidities, hospital and ICU admission criteria, criteria for diagnostic imaging, and COVID-19 therapies likely contribute to this wide range of estimates. Like other medical patients, those with more severe disease, especially if they have additional risk factors (e.g. older, male, obesity, cancer, history of VTE, comorbid diseases, ICU care), have a higher risk of VTE than those with mild or asymptomatic disease. VTE rate in outpatients has not been reported.https://www.hematology.org/covid-19/covid-19-and-vte-anticoagulation","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcShHIpdubHvpUTuFU8w_GEhFBfZh04L_boM3psdecQiPg0wNnv2&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"stemlynsblog.org","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSJeIJf932CO0xINkzXfWW6mleSVLWP7vm67p5Y6GCKV7VF0jn-&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"slideplayer.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadsthromboembolismcsv/thromboembolism.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'thromboembolism.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#What is the recommended VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19?\n\nAll hospitalized adults with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with LMWH over unfractionated heparin to reduce contact, unless the risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of thrombosis.\n\nShould seriously ill COVID-19 patients receive therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation empirically (i.e., in the absence of confirmed or suspected VTE)?\nMicrovascular thrombosis is hypothesized to be involved in hypoxemic respiratory failure in some patients with COVID-19.
