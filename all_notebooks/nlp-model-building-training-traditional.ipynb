In this case, we will create an initial baseline with statistical classification algorithms by using both non semantic vectors as well as semantic vectors. Later we will try to improvise on these baselines with standard neural models like Bidirectional LSTMs, Convolution Networks, Gated Recurrecnt Units. The improvements of these traditional neural models over the baselines would be further investigated when we will explore advanced architectures, particularly that of an encoder decoder . Further advancement would be made on attention based encoder-decoder modules like Transformers and using the different flavours from BERT to GPT.\n\nThe following is the workflow of this notebook:\n\n- Traditional NN models\n  - With Static Embeddings"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Recap from Workshop-1\n\nIn the previous [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/colearninglounge/nlp-end-to-end-cll-nlp-workshop), we learned about cleaning,EDA, vectorization and embeddings.

Logistic Regression Classifier uses a sigmoid kernel for training. In a supervised learning mode , Logistic Regression is one of the standardised models under generalized linear models which tries a convex optimization by passing the cost function through the sigmoid kernel. The sigmoid function is denoted by the formulation:\n\n<img src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/education/formulas2/-1/en/sigmoid_function.svg\">\n\n\nThis equation due to its convergence property (+/- infinity) and due to its differentiability , the sigmoid kernel allows clamping of predicted values to binary labels. The sigmoid curve actually has optima at x=0 and x=1.Now in the case of supervised logistic regression, when we try to optimize the cost function (in this case a linear sum of weights & biases passed through sigmoid kernel), by applying stochastic gradient descent. Since by gradient descent, the steepest slope is considered, the change in derivatives (gradients) at each stage is computed and the weights of the cost function are updated.

The general methodology for using Kfold and Cross Validation is provided below:\n\n- Shuffle the dataset randomly.\n- Split the dataset into k groups\n- For each unique group:\n   - Take the group as a hold out or test data set\n   - Take the remaining groups as a training data set\n   - Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set\n   - Retain the evaluation score and discard the model\n- Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores\n\nThis technique has a following rule: The first ``` n_samples % n_splits``` folds have size ``` n_samples // n_splits + 1```, other folds have size ``` n_samples // n_splits```, where n_samples is the number of samples.\n\nA typical flowchart of cross validation is provided below:\n\n<img src=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/grid_search_workflow.png\">\n\nThis allows for better hyperparameter search using GridSearch CV algorithms which will be covered later.\nThe following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n\n- A model is trained using  of the folds as training data;\n\n- The resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy).\n\nThe performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the loop. This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as is the case when fixing an arbitrary validation set), which is a major advantage in problems such as inverse inference where the number of samples is very small.\n\n<img src=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/grid_search_cross_validation.png\">\n\nSome resources:\n\n- [Blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/)\n- [Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html)\n- [Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Brief Introduction of Statistical Models\n\n\nThis is going to be a brief introduction of different statistical models which will be used simultaeneously with k fold and cross validation techniques for examining the accuracy of the models. In this case, we will be focussing on accuracy as the major KPI and later we will be running on different observations such as f1,ROC etc.\n\n\n### Decision Trees\n\n[Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) is a supervised model for classification/regression. This works on creating decision branches which evolves a criteria and is often acknowledged as a simplistic classification (white box) model as the stages of decision can be easily derived. A regression tree appears as follows:\n\n<img src=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_tree_regression_0011.png\">\n\nThe [algorithms](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) include ID3,C4.5/C5.0,CART which can be analysed as follows:\n\n- ID3(Iterative Dichotomiser 3) was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. The algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information gain for categorical targets. Trees are grown to their maximum size and then a pruning step is usually applied to improve the ability of the tree to generalise to unseen data.\n\n- C4.5 is the successor to ID3 and removed the restriction that features must be categorical by dynamically defining a discrete attribute (based on numerical variables) that partitions the continuous attribute value into a discrete set of intervals. C4.5 converts the trained trees (i.e. the output of the ID3 algorithm) into sets of if-then rules. These accuracy of each rule is then evaluated to determine the order in which they should be applied. Pruning is done by removing a rule’s precondition if the accuracy of the rule improves without it.\n\n- C5.0 is Quinlan’s latest version release under a proprietary license. It uses less memory and builds smaller rulesets than C4.5 while being more accurate.\n\n- CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is very similar to C4.5, but it differs in that it supports numerical target variables (regression) and does not compute rule sets. CART constructs binary trees using the feature and threshold that yield the largest information gain at each node.\n\n\nIn general, the major logics involved in Decision Trees involves computation of Entropy or Gini Index, which is as follows:\n\n<img src=\"https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-690a5cee77c5927cade25f26d1e53e77\">\n\nTypically a Gini Coefficient  is evaluated as the area between the ```y=x``` line and Lorentz curve\n\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iawuF.jpg\">\n\n\nMisclassification is another criteria:\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2180/1*O5eXoV-SePhZ30AbCikXHw.png\">\n\nTypically a decision tree appears as follows:\n\n<img src=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/iris.png\">\n\nSome resources:\n\n- [Blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/scikit-learn-decision-trees-explained-803f3812290d)\n- [Blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-and-regression-trees-for-machine-learning/)\n- [Blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cost-sensitive-decision-trees-for-imbalanced-classification/)\n\n\n\n### Random Forests \n\n\n[Random Forests](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)  is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the ```max_samples``` parameter ```if bootstrap=True (default)```, otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree. When splitting each node during the construction of a tree, the best split is found either from all input features or a random subset of size ```max_features```. (See the parameter tuning guidelines for more details).The purpose of these two sources of randomness is to decrease the variance of the forest estimator. Indeed, individual decision trees typically exhibit high variance and tend to overfit. The injected randomness in forests yield decision trees with somewhat decoupled prediction errors. By taking an average of those predictions, some errors can cancel out. Random forests achieve a reduced variance by combining diverse trees, sometimes at the cost of a slight increase in bias. In practice the variance reduction is often significant hence yielding an overall better model.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hung_Cao12/publication/333438248/figure/fig6/AS:763710377299970@1559094151459/Random-Forest-model-with-majority-voting.ppm\">\n\n\n### Gradient Boosting Forests and Trees\n\n[Gradient Boosting](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning/) is a central part of ensemble modelling in sklearn.\n\nThe goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability / robustness over a single estimator.\n\nTwo families of ensemble methods are usually distinguished:\n\n- In averaging methods, the driving principle is to build several estimators independently and then to average their predictions. On average, the combined estimator is usually better than any of the single base estimator because its variance is reduced.\n\n  Examples: Bagging methods, Forests of randomized trees\n\n- By contrast, in boosting methods, base estimators are built sequentially and one tries to reduce the bias of the combined estimator. The motivation is to combine several weak models to produce a powerful ensemble.\n\n  Examples: AdaBoost, Gradient Tree Boosting\n\n\nPictorially these can be represented as :\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3908/1*FoOt85zXNCaNFzpEj7ucuA.png\">\n\n\nSeveral Boosting Models can be found under this criteria:\n\n#### [AdaBoosting](https://blog.paperspace.com/adaboost-optimizer/#:~:text=AdaBoost%20is%20an%20ensemble%20learning,turn%20them%20into%20strong%20ones.): \nThe core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying weights  to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to (1/N), so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence\n\n<img
