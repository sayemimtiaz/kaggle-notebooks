The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine._\n\n_In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset._\n\n_Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings._\n\n_Some of the interesting questions (tasks) which can be performed on this dataset_\n\n* Understanding what content is available in different countries\n* Identifying similar content by matching text-based features\n* Network analysis of Actors / Directors and find interesting insights\n* Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.\n___","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"top\"></a>\n<div class=\"list-group\" id=\"list-tab\" role=\"tablist\">\n<h3 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\">Table of Content</h3>\n\n* [1.
