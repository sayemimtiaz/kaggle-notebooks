In short, we are doing story-telling about the video-cum-podcast show [Sanyam Bhutani](http://twitter.com/bhutanisanyam1) runs regularly where he interviews ML and DS professionals from the industry, academia and all walks of life - many of whom are his \"heroes\".\n\n\nThese are the high-level goals of the task:\n\n**Goals:**\n\n- Presentation: How well is the notebook written in terms of code quality, text description, and grammar?\n- Storytelling: Is there a natural flow of the story that connects various points?\n- Visualizations: Are the visualizations appealing, understandable, and aligned with the description?\n- Insights: Are the insights relevant, useful, and actionable?\n- Innovation: How novel and creative are the ideas and approaches?\n\n\n**Datasets:**\n\nThis kernel uses the original [dataset provided by the organisers](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chai-time-data-science) plus a few more from other participants who have kindly made them public for the task (see under the _Input_ folder of this kernel).\n\n\n**Inspiration:**\n\nI have been through many kernels posted under this task (30+ at the time of the writing) and a few discussion topics before starting this kernel. These have given me an idea of the trends to keep in mind but at the same time helped continue to develop my ideas along the way and present them below. I may include ideas or excerpts from other kernels (I will cite them when I do).\n\n**Utility script**\n\nAmong other `python` libraries, we will also be using the [NLP Profiler utility script](https://www.kaggle.com/neomatrix369/nlp-profiler-class) to analyse the text aspects of the provided datasets in this kernel. An implementation kernel showing how to use this utility script can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/neomatrix369/nlp-profiler-simple-dataset)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents</span></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='importing'></a>\n\n---\n\n## Importing libraries and packages"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Installation using pip\n### import NLP Profiler after installing from the GitHub repo (master branch)\n!pip uninstall -qy typing\n!pip install git+https://github.com/neomatrix369/nlp_profiler.git@master\n# or ! pip install nlp_profiler==0.0.3\nimport nlp_profiler.core as NLPProfiler","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n### import the utility script (see https://www.kaggle.com/neomatrix369/nlp-profiler-class)\n# from nlp_profiler_class import NLPProfiler ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# visualization tools\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly_express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n# prettify plots\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [20.0, 7.0]\n\nsns.set_palette(sns.color_palette(\"muted\"))\nsns.set_style(\"ticks\")\nsns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(20.0, 20.0)})\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\nsns.set(font_scale=1.25)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents</span></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='questions'></a>\n\n----------\n\n## Questions"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='filteredList'></a>\n\n----------\n\n### A filtered list of questions (suggestions from various sources)\n\nThese were a list of questions I gathered by going through various kernels and discussion points (although there were many more I have come across):\n\n- What makes an interview bring more audience?\n- Does the time of the day decide, whether an interview will be popular or not?\n- What pattern is seen in the likes and views of a particular episode?\n\t- So, using the twitter audience sizes would be an interesting feature that you can capture.\n\t- What is CTDS, exactly, categorise it?\n    - Repeated/Favourite Questions? \n\t- Has the question asking trend changed?\n\t- (Bad) Jokes over time (Hint: Marked with \"haha\"-> repetitions of ha might change 😉 )\n- How does the duration relate to reach?

And in the light of the above concepts, this can play a compelling role in deciding future viewerships, fan clubs and all other related factors. That's why sometimes we re-watch or revisit the same topic or topics we have already read about from source/author A or source/Author B or source/Author C - each has their perception and method of delivery which draws us to them and binds us to them."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#myApproach'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to My Approach</span></a> <a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents</span></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='overallConclusion'></a>\n\n----------\n\n## Overall conclusion"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<table border=1 bgcolor=\"#FF9F00\"><tr><td>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">I have only touched on one question and also only one episode among all the shows, and only using the high-level NLP concepts my library <a href=https://github.com/neomatrix369/nlp_profiler/>NLP Profiler</a> provides and some help from another kernel and dataset. Also, the ideas expressed above may need some validation and verification before we can answer the question with an even better degree of accuracy.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">I did not take the route like the other approaches and examples we see in the Kernels section, simply because I could not reason the statistical outputs and link the threads to the threads from the questions we went about trying to answer (maybe the others could), in this case particularly the question <b>\"What makes an interview bring more audience?\"</b>. You see when we read or hear something or when another person does the same, neither of us conclude at any given moment or at the end of a series of moments: \"they said n words or m characters in this sentences\" - \"I like that person/show/topic\" or \"I dislike that person/show/topic because the term 'abc' wasn't used in this frequency across these moments\" and things like that, we pick much higher level signals and the above is an example in that direction.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Although I was tempted to use one or two of the NLP extractions and conclusions and blend it with my work here, although it's lower on my list as I want to make my approach and perspective clear to everyone and make them useful, before adding more layers to it.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Some reasoning, logical thinking and gut-feeling say the above might have some good substance but I will leave this to your judgement to decide what is more correct and fitting and what isn't. And also what is more practical and achievable and what isn't. I hope the arguments are clear and if not, please ask away. I will do my best to review and make things clearer with multiple iterations.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Once again thanks to those who provided such amazing kernels, visualisations and useful datasets that my work of explaining myself became easier.</p>\n</td></tr></table>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents</span></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='resources'></a>\n\n----------\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Plotly/plotly express charts](https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/)\n- [Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/index.html)\n  - [The R Graph Gallery – Help and inspiration for R charts](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)\n- [NLP Profiler Resources](https://www.kaggle.com/general/166954) | [on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nlp-profiler/)\n- [Awesome AI-ML-DL: Better NLP library](https://bit.ly/better-nlp-launch)\n- [Awesome AI-ML-DL: NLP Resources](https://github.com/neomatrix369/awesome-ai-ml-dl/tree/master/natural-language-processing)\n- [Awesome AI-ML-DL Github](https://github.com/neomatrix369/awesome-ai-ml-dl/blob/)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
