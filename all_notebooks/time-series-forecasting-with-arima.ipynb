The units are a sales count and there are 36 observations. The original dataset is credited to Makridakis, Wheelwright, and Hyndman (1998).

An ARIMA model can be created using the statsmodels library as follows:\n\n- Define the model by calling <font color = \"blue\"> ARIMA() </font> and passing in the p, d, and q parameters.\n- The model is prepared on the training data by calling the <font color = \"blue\"> fit()  </font>function.\n- Predictions can be made by calling the <font color = \"blue\"> predict()  </font> function and specifying the index of the time or times to be predicted.\n\nLet’s start off with something simple. We will fit an ARIMA model to the entire Shampoo Sales dataset and review the residual errors.\n\nFirst, we fit an <font color = \"blue\"> ARIMA(5,1,0) model. </font> This sets the lag value to 5 for autoregression, uses a difference order of 1 to make the time series stationary, and uses a moving average model of 0.\n\n**When fitting the model, a lot of debug information is provided about the fit of the linear regression model.

It accepts the index of the time steps to make predictions as arguments. These indexes are relative to the start of the training dataset used to make predictions.\n\nIf we used 100 observations in the training dataset to fit the model, then the index of the next time step for making a prediction would be specified to the prediction function as start=101, end=101. This would return an array with one element containing the prediction.\n\nWe also would prefer the forecasted values to be in the original scale, in case we performed any differencing (d>0 when configuring the model). This can be specified by setting the typ argument to the value ‘levels’: typ=’levels’.\n\nAlternately, we can avoid all of these specifications by using the forecast() function, which performs a one-step forecast using the model.\n\nWe can split the training dataset into train and test sets, use the train set to fit the model, and generate a prediction for each element on the test set.\n\nA rolling forecast is required given the dependence on observations in prior time steps for differencing and the AR model. A crude way to perform this rolling forecast is to re-create the ARIMA model after each new observation is received.\n\nWe manually keep track of all observations in a list called history that is seeded with the training data and to which new observations are appended each iteration.\n\nPutting this all together, below is an example of a rolling forecast with the ARIMA model in Python."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n \n\nX = series.values\nsize = int(len(X) * 0.66)\n\n\ntrain, test = X[0:size], X[size:len(X)]\nhistory = [x for x in train]\npredictions = []\n\n\nfor t in range(len(test)):\n\tmodel = ARIMA(history, order=(5,1,0))\n\tmodel_fit = model.fit(disp=0)\n\toutput = model_fit.forecast()\n\tyhat = output[0]\n\tpredictions.append(yhat)\n\tobs = test[t]\n\thistory.append(obs)\n\tprint('predicted=%f, expected=%f' % (yhat, obs))\n    \n\n\n\n\n# plot\nplt.plot(test, label = 'original sales', marker = '*')\nplt.plot(predictions, color='red', label = 'predicted sales', marker = '*')\nplt.title('Performance Evaluation')\nplt.xlabel('Future Steps')\nplt.ylabel('Sales')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Mean Squared Error (MSE)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\nerror = mean_squared_error(test, predictions)\nprint('Test Root Mean Squared Error: %.3f' % math.sqrt(error))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summary of Configuring an ARIMA Model\nThe classical approach for fitting an ARIMA model is to follow the [Box-Jenkins Methodology.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Jenkins_method)\n\nThis is a process that uses time series analysis and diagnostics to discover good parameters for the ARIMA model.\n\nIn summary, the steps of this process are as follows:\n\n1. <font color=\"blue\"> Model Identification.</font> Use plots and summary statistics to identify trends, seasonality, and autoregression elements to get an idea of the amount of differencing and the size of the lag that will be required.\n2. <font color = \"blue\"> Parameter Estimation. </font> Use a fitting procedure to find the coefficients of the regression model.\n3. <font color = \"blue\"> Model Checking.</font> Use plots and statistical tests of the residual errors to determine the amount and type of temporal structure not captured by the model.\n\nThe process is repeated until either a desirable level of fit is achieved on the in-sample or out-of-sample observations (e.g. training or test datasets)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
