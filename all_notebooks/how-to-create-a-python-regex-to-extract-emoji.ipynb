The advantage of the second is that it is much more readable (imagine wanting to match the letters from A to T for example). It would be very difficult to read through and understand which letters are included. `[A-T]` is very easy to read.  \nI also believe there might be a slight performance boost with character ranges. Some regex engines do certain optimizations on their own, and I'm not aware of those details. But in general making two comparisons is way more efficient than making fifty.  \nFor example, you have the number 42, and want to check if it falls between 1 and 100. \nIn the character class case, you make to comparisons. You check if 42 >= 1 and 42 <=100.  \nIf you have all the numbers listed from 1 to 100, then you will have to make 42 comparisons to find out. On average, if you have a range of 100 numbers, you will be making fifty comparisons to find out. With larger ranges, this can obviously go very big.  \n\nBelow is the function `get_ranges`. It takes a list of integers, and returns a list of tuples, each representing the local minimum and maximum for any number of contiguous integers (numbers differing by 1).  \nFor example if I have the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6 7, 8, 10, 20]`, it will return `[(1, 4), (6, 8), (10, 10), (20, 20)]`\n\nThe numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, can converted into a character range `[1-4]`, so do the numbers 6, 7, and 8. 10 and 20 are not part of a series of integers differing by one, so they are represented as single-number ranges.
