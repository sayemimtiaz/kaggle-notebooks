Bad ratings (1, 2) usually mean that an app or a game has serious problems, like crashing, lagging and similar problems.

It's easy to get installs for action games, but difficult to satisfy customers. So if we're entering the market with an action game, we have to make sure that it's bug free and it's not getting boring after a while. Highest ratings belong to casino, card, puzzle and word games.

We may not be successful in terms of ratings, so we have to be very cautious about it and read every negative feedback. If we want slower but bold development, we can think of making board or card games. They're easy to make and they usually get higher ratings, but they are not installed as much as action or arcade games. One other category that we can think of is music. They have too much 1 star ratings which means they're \"bug prone\" and there aren't many quality games. So a quality music game will immediately draw attention from many players. They also have moderate amount of growth.","metadata":{}}]}
