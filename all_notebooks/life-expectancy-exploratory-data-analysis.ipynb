The variables and dataset were given a general description so that a better understanding of what the variables mean could be gathered. Then both explicit and inexplicit missing values were detected. Inexplicit missing values were values that didn't make sense for a variable given the nature of the data. There were a number of seemingly nonsensical values found given many variables' descriptions. Those inexplicit missing values were then converted to explicit missing values or nulls. Interpolation would have likely been the best method to deal with the now explicit null values (since it is time series data), but interpolation in this case would not have garnered any results. Therefore, the next best thing was done instead, imputation based on the means of all countries by year. Once missing values were sorted, the next step was detecting and dealing with outliers. Extreme value detection was done primarily by using standard box and whisker plots with a standard IQR threshold of 1.5. Using this technique, each variable's data was winsorized on a one by one basis to eliminate outliers while limiting the loss of data. Once this step was complete, exploration of the data could be conducted. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The now clean dataset was then analyzed using univariate and bivariate techniques. One of the univariate techniques used was to inspect continuous variables using histograms in order to get an idea of their distributions. The general descriptive statistics were also found for the continuous variables. After that, categorical count plots were created to get an idea of the 'distribution' of categorical data. From that analysis it was discovered that the majority of the data fell under the 'Developing' country status. With the univariate analysis complete, it was time to move on to bivariate analysis. Bivariate analysis definitely laid most of the groundwork for understanding the relationships not only between the target variable (Life Expectancy) and the other variables, but also every variable compare to one another. The primary method used in the bivariate analysis was by the use of the correlation matrix in conjunction with the heatmap visual from the Seaborn library. This took care of the main comparisons between continuous to continuous data and was the main foundation for feature selection. But before moving on to feature engineering, some categorical variables were compared to the target variable. It was found that 'Life Expectancy' with respect to year did not garner significant enough difference to use in analysis. However, it was found that the 'Status' of a country did have a significant effect on 'Life Expectancy'. In addition to 'Life Expectancy' it also appeared to be significantly different for a number of other continuous variables. It is for this reason that new indicator variables, 'Developed' and 'Developing', were created in the next section, feature engineering."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finally, feature engineering. First, the categorical variables 'Year' and 'Country' were removed as they didn't provide significant differences between data. Then with a general understanding of the variables and the relationship of those variables to one another, it was relatively simple to remove a number of 'highly correlated to one another' variables. The primary method was to use the correlation matrix heatmap in order to detect variables that were highly correlated to another, then from those pairs keep the variable which was more highly correlated with the target. Using this method, the number of variables has been dropped from 20 down to 12 features. The dimensionality reduction method of PCA was used, but didn't seem to garner very useful results. Ultimately, the features kept were those prior to the operation of PCA. It is likely that further transformation of the features should be done, but without knowing which model will be used this set of basic features appears to be the best and most representative set for the target variable of 'Life Expectancy'. With that being said, below is the final heatmap for all the features ultimately selected above (as well as the target variable)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"feat_heatmap()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
