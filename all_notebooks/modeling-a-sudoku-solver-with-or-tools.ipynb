Two approaches will be used:\n\n* Constraint Programming\n* Integer Programming\n\nFor both approaches, The [OR Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) lib will be used.\n\nOR-Tools is an open source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling the world's toughest problems in vehicle routing, flows, linear programming, **integer programming and constraint programming**.\n\n# Sudoku Puzzle\n\nSudoku is a mathematical game that was invented in the late 1970s, became popular in Japan in the 1980s and became known internationally in 2005 when numerous newspapers began publishing it in their hobbies section. \n\nThe objective of the game is to place numbers from 1 to 9 in each of the empty cells in a 9x9 grid, consisting of 3x3 subgrades called regions. The puzzle contains some initial clues, which are numbers inserted into some cells, to allow an induction or deduction of numbers into empty cells. Each column, row, and region can only have a number from each of 1 through 9.\n\nFor instance, given the initial Sudoku state:\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg/1024px-Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg.png\" width=\"300\">\n\nThe final state must be:\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714_solution.svg/1024px-Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714_solution.svg.png\" width=\"300\">"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading sample\n\nThe 9 Million Sudoku Puzzle dataset will be used.

In Constraint Programming, users declaratively state the constraints on the feasible solutions for a set of decision variables. Constraints differ from the common primitives of imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found. In additions to constraints, users also need to specify a method to solve these constraints. This typically draws upon standard methods like chronological backtracking and constraint propagation, but may use customized code like a problem specific branching heuristic.\n\nConstraint Programming is based on feasibility (finding a feasible solution) rather than optimization (finding an optimal solution) and focuses on the constraints and variables rather than the objective function. In fact, a CP problem may not even have an objective function — the goal may simply be to narrow down a vary large set of possible solutions to a more manageable subset by adding constraints to the problem. However, CP can be used to solve standard optimization problems, which have an objective function, by simply comparing the value of the objective for all feasible solutions. See The Job shop problem for an example of this."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Modeling a Sudoku Solver with OR Tools Constraint Programming Solver\n\nTo start modeling a Sudoku Solver with OR Tools Constraint Programming, the following steps must be executed:\n\n1.

Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming (also known as mathematical optimization).\n\nMore formally, linear programming is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints. Its feasible region is a convex polytope, which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces, each of which is defined by a linear inequality. Its objective function is a real-valued affine (linear) function defined on this polyhedron. A linear programming algorithm finds a point in the polytope where this function has the smallest (or largest) value if such a point exists.\n\nLinear programs are problems that can be expressed in canonical form as\n\n*Maximize*   $c^t \\times x$  \n*Subject to* $A \\times x \\leq b$  \n*And*        $x \\geq 0$\n\nwhere $x$ represents the vector of variables (to be determined), $c$ and $b$ are vectors of (known) coefficients, $A$ is a (known) matrix of coefficients, and $(\\cdot)^T$ is the matrix transpose. The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the objective function ($c^t \\times x$ in this case). The inequalities $A \\times x \\leq b$ and $x \\geq 0$ are the constraints which specify a convex polytope over which the objective function is to be optimized. In this context, two vectors are comparable when they have the same dimensions. If every entry in the first is less-than or equal-to the corresponding entry in the second, then it can be said that the first vector is less-than or equal-to the second vector.\n\n## Mixed Integer Programming\n\nAn Integer Programming problem is a special form of Linear Programming in which some or all of the variables are restricted to be integers. In many settings the term refers to integer linear programming (ILP), in which the objective function and the constraints (other than the integer constraints) are linear.\n\nInteger programming is NP-complete. In particular, the special case of 0-1 integer linear programming, in which unknowns are binary, and only the restrictions must be satisfied.\n\nIf some decision variables are not discrete the problem is known as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem.\n\nFor instance, the following model:\n\nMaximize $y$  \nSubject to:  \n$-x + y \\leq 1$  \n$3x + 2y \\leq 12$  \n$2x + 3y \\leq 12$  \n$x, y \\geq 0$  \n$x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nCan be plotted like the image below, where the blue lines are the linear bounds, but $x$ and $y$ **can't** assume any of these values, since they're not integers. However, the red dots are under the blue area and are integer values, these are the values $x$ and $y$ **can** assume. Since this model tries do maximize $y$, this means that $y$ must be 2 and $x$ can be 1 or 2. Both this values will maximize $y$ and satisfy all the declared constraints.\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/IP_polytope_with_LP_relaxation.svg/350px-IP_polytope_with_LP_relaxation.svg.png\"/>\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Modeling a Sudoku Solver with OR Tools Integer Programming Solver\n\nFor this IP formulation there is no solution that is better than another, only a feasible solution matters, the one which satisfies all constraints. Therefore, this formulation will not require an objective function. That been said, this formulation is quite similar to the CP model, but with a subtle difference: instead of a 2D matrix with integer variables (varying from 1 to 9), a binary representation of a 3D matrix will be used.\n\nFor instance, the simple attribution $x[0,3] = 2$ is translated to 9 attributions like: $x[0,3,0] = 0$, $x[0,3,1] = 1$, $x[0,3,2] = 0$, ..., $x[0,3,8] = 0$. On this representation the model must assure that only one possible value for a cell is valid (1) while the others must be invalid (0), therefore the additional constraint must be added to the model:\n\n$\\sum_{0}^{k-1} x[i, j, k] = 1, \\forall i, j$ (*)\n\nTo start modeling a Sudoku Solver with OR Tools Integer Programming, the following steps must be executed:\n\n1. To start modeling with OR Tools is to create an instance of the solver with `pywraplp.Solver(...)`. On this example, the CBC MIP Solver is used;\n2. Create a grid of variables. Every variables represents a possible value of a cell of the sudoku, this means that every variable must be a boolean value and vary from 0 to 1. That been said a matrix $x$ and all values are initialized as boolean variables;\n3. Add constraints to fetch all initial values on the *known* values;\n4. Add constraint to assure that only one possible value for a cell is valid (*);\n5. Define the *rows*, *columns* and regions *constraints*.\n6. Solve model using `solver.Solve()`;\n7. After model is solved, use `x[i, j, k].solution_value()` to show the final value of all variables on the $x$ matrix and convert it from boolean to integer."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from ortools.linear_solver import pywraplp\n\ndef solve_with_ip(grid: np.ndarray) -> (np.ndarray, float):\n    '''Solve Sudoku instance (np.matrix) with IP modeling.
