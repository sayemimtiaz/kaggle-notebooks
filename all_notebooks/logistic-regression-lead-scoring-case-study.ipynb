On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.\n\nThe company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.\n\nThere are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage, but only a few of them come out as paying customers. In the middle stage, you need to nurture the potential leads well (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating etc. ) in order to get a higher lead conversion.\n\nAn X Education need help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.\n\n## Goals and Objectives\nThere are quite a few goals for this case study.\n\n - Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.\n - There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Supress Warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Importing libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"darkgrid\")\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Data display customization\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 100)\n\n\n#importing sklearn libraries\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import RFE\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nimport statsmodels.api as sm  \nfrom statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T13:21:16.046082Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T13:21:16.046503Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.122571Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T13:21:16.046416Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.121596Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#load the dataset\nleads_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/leadscore/Leads.csv\")\nleads_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.127331Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.127674Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.300623Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.127643Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.299531Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#check the shape of dataframe\nleads_df.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.305198Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.305531Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.311764Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.305501Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.310632Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#inspect the dataframe\nleads_df.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.313376Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.313809Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.364775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.313765Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.363833Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#check the statistics of dataframe\nleads_df.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.369011Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.369333Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.404718Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.369295Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.403736Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#check null values in each column in dataframe\nleads_df.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.407251Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.407724Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.441411Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.40769Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.440328Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Duplicate check\n\nleads_df.loc[leads_df.duplicated()]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.44289Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.443487Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.499488Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.44344Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.498569Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#check the original Conversion Rate\noriginal_Conversion_rate = round((sum(leads_df['Converted'])/len(leads_df['Converted'].index))*100, 2)\nprint(\"The conversion rate of leads is \",original_Conversion_rate)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.501194Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.501616Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.509637Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.501574Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T13:21:18.508771Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Observation\n\n- #### The shape of leads dataset is 9240 rows and 37 columns.\n- #### There are 7 numerical columns and 30 categorical columns\n- #### There are many 'Select' values present in various columns in the dataset.
