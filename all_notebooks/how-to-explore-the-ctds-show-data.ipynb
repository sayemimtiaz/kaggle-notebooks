EDA essentially refers to employing a variety of techniques to uncover some underlying patterns in data. This in turn helps to get insights into the data which might otherwise may not be apparent. Apart from this EDA can also help detect outliers, missing values and at times corrupted data. There is no single technique to perform EDA. This means there are no set of rules to analyse and explore data but there are some ways by which you can get started when you encounter a new dataset. \n\nIn a way, EDA helps to explore and gather hidden insights which are backed by data and not by mere assumptions.\n\n\n## Ways to proceed in this competition\n\nBefore proceeding, it is advisable to go through https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chai-time-data-science/discussion/156137 to understand the context of the competition.\n\n**Step 1**: You can either fork this notebook and continue working on this as a base notebook by clicking on the \"**Copy and Edit**\" button in the top right corner of this window.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a fresh notebook by clicking on the \"**New Notebook**\" button on the Dataset's Homepage.\n\n**Step 2**: Click on the \"**Save Version**\" button to publish your notebook.\n\n**Step 3**: Adjust the \"**Sharing\"/\"Access**\" setting to change your notebook from private to public (and add citations if necessary).\n\n**Step 4**: Explore additional analyses at https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chai-time-data-science/version/5/kernels\n\n**Step 5**: Tell a story using the data for the chance to win a prize!\n\n**Step 6**: Make a Submission on or before 14th July, 2020. To be accepted as a valid submission, you need to submit your public notebook to the Task here : https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chai-time-data-science/tasks?taskId=1183. Here is a.gif which explains the process in more detail.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/rYglABC.gif)\n\nRemember that only the notebooks submitted to the Task will be eligible for a prize.\n\nLet's start by exploring the dataset and see if we can uncover some interesting facts which could benefit the [CTDS show](https://chaitimedatascience.com/).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install dexplot","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport dexplot as dxp\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n#plotly\n!pip install chart_studio\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport chart_studio.plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot\nimport cufflinks\ncufflinks.go_offline()\ncufflinks.set_config_file(world_readable=True, theme='pearl')\n\n\nimport re                                  # library for regular expression operations\nimport string                              # for string operations\nimport nltk \nnltk.download('stopwords')\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords          # module for stop words that come with NLTK\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer        # module for stemming\nfrom nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer   # module for tokenizing strings\n\n#datetime\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport os\n\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Datasets\n\nThe dataset consists of metadata of all episodes like title, category, flavour of tea, recording/release dates along with statistics like duration, views, watch hours from YouTube, Spotify, Apple now updated until 00:00 21st June, 2020.
