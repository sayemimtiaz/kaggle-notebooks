We started by creating new variables to show half-by-half and overall home/away performance on a match, team and season level. We then explored how H/A evolved over time and tried to unpack why these changes happened.\n\nWe found that home advantage overall has dropped over time in each of the top 5 leagues. In the Premier League, this is driven in part by more goals being scored by away teams. Additionally, when we split out H/A form by the level of the team, the drop in home performance is only seen among the poorer teams. The better teams in the league are maintaining their home level AND improving their away form, demonstrating the widening gap in Premier League football.\n\nThere are loads of other questions to answer both with this dataset and by enhancing it with more data:\n\n* Dives into other leagues\n* Is home advantage affected by time in season? Does it mean more when survival or European places are on the line?\n* Individual team profiles\n* Why home advantage is even a thing\n\nSoon, I imagine we might also be more knowledgable on the effects of empty and neutrally held matches...\n\nI look forward to seeing where people can enhance this work - please show us at [FC Python](https://twitter.com/FC_Python) and we will be happy to share!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
