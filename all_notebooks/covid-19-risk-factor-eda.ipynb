The notebook is divided into two parts: 1) a walkthrough of the technique which we use to initially extract relevant information and 2) a cross-referencing with other datasets in order to further our findings. Both parts are described at a high level below. We delve into much greater detail during the actual analysis.\n\nIn Part 1, we begin by reading in the majority of the data available in the official Kaggle dataset. We will organize and clean the data, focusing on the titles and body text of the scholarly articles and research papers we have. We will then run a Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA (source: https://stackabuse.com/python-for-nlp-topic-modeling/), to determine the various topics discussed in the data. Our focus will be to study a specific aspect of COVID-19 risk factors: public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control of the virus. We will filter the data based on the LDA to include papers which discuss the latter. Finally, we will run a sentiment analysis on the remaining data to extract the top ten most positive and top ten most negative papers, before combing through them manually to determine the ones relevant to our topic. Note that this technique is generalizable to any topic of our choice, which is what makes it powerful.\n\nIn Part 2, we will gather other datasets related to COVID-19. The datasets we use will focus particularly on the impact the virus has had on different countries and how those countries have responded. We aim to visualize and cross-reference this data with the findings from Part 1, in order to reach a more refined conclusion regarding public health measures that may be useful in containing the spread of COVID-19."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 1: Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Sentiment Analysis\n\nWe begin by reading in the official Kaggle dataset and organizing the data into a table.

While this technique is generalizable to any of the topics discovered through the LDA we ran above, our focus here lies in studying public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control of coronavirus. There are far too many papers and articles in our table above to comb through by hand, even after filtering based on the LDA. The idea is that by running a sentiment analysis, we can extract papers containing titles with strong sentiments (either positive or negative). While this is certainly not comprehensive, the hope is that some of these high-sentiment papers contain information which could prove useful to the medical community.\n\nWe realize that the reasoning behind performing a sentiment analysis here may be confusing. Essentially, we require a way to filter the data further, and select papers from the corpus relevant to our topic. Sentiment analysis acts as a pseudo-random filter, but with the added effect of isolating papers with strong sentiments, which are likely to contain useful information.

Variously, it was described as a\" serious and straining situation\" and a \"situation that carries national and international significance\". Frontline HCWs and senior decision-makers alike not only perceived this high gravity, but also the high demands the outbreak placed on them personally.\"\n\n* \"**Factors perceived to have contributed to outbreak occurrence**:: Strong consensus existed among participants that the organization's \"growing reliance on ED boarding\" was a main contributor to the outbreak. While some lamented that this build up was permitted by senior decision-makers to occur over the long-term, others saw the contributing factors as being more upstream. These factors are related to the high trust patients had for the NGHA, the relative lack of primary care services and problems associated with patient flows at the level of the city, communication and teamwork between the city hospitals, and the lack of a national plan that allows hospitals across different sectors to share the burden of the growing patient population. Another leading factor to the outbreak was the \"inadequate implementation of IPC guidelines\" within the extremely busy ED and the suboptimal recognition of the importance of IPC principles across the organization. empowering HCWs to work collaboratively to address the outbreak, involving staff in outbreak control and stimulating staff resilience and teamwork. The culture was one of \"collective leadership practice\" (table 1) with leaders being seen to have practiced high levels of availability, visibility, empowerment of middle management and strong links with frontline staff.\"\n\n* \"**Factors inhibiting outbreak control**:: Factors that were perceived to challenge the outbreak management were mostly related to historical management practices and context. The organization was perceived to be acutely and chronically slow in responding to the outbreak. The main factors perceived to limit the capacity of handling the outbreak adequately were related to: Factors inhibiting outbreak control:: 1. Initial logistic barriers to promptly implement the escalation process outlined in the institution's Infectious Disease Epidemic Plan (IDEP) ( Anxiety increased among health professionals, due to the \"lack of appropriate staff counseling and mental health support\". The psychological demands on frontline health professionals escalated, not only by undertaking tasks associated with the IDEP implementation, but also due to a range of coalescing factors; most notably the need to manage the outbreak simultaneously with the closure of most of the institution's units, combined with the negative media commentary. Almost all frontline participants have repeatedly expressed the need for a center that provides counseling and mental health support to employees in such stressful situations.\"\n\n* \"**Long-term institutional gains in response to the outbreak management**:: 1-Improvement in the facility to be more compatible with IC guidelines. KAMC-R to work collaboratively to address long-standing issues around IPC, ED boarding and nursing standards.\"\n\n                                   **BRIEF SUMMARY**\n\nFor context, this paper pertains to MERS-CoV, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The study focuses on best (and worst) practices in health care settings with regard to controlling an outbreak. The paper dicusses that the outbreak initially occurred because of a lack of national planning which made it difficult for hospitals throughout the nation to handle the growing number of patients. The outbreak was then difficult to control due to a slow response combined with lack of mental support and counseling for health professionals. However, the silver lining gained from this was the improvement of institutions in the long run with regard to being prepared for such an outbreak. We shall later see that this made a large difference in why South Korea had such an effective response to the COVID-19 outbreak."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 2: Gathering Relevant Info from other Datasets\n\nBelow, we read in a dataset which contains cumulative data on confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths related to COVID-19 by country.

Recall that after we conducted our initial Latent Dirichlet Allocation and sentiment analysis, we isolated a particular paper which pertained to control of a MERS-CoV outbreak. From the paper, we learned that one of the key factors in controlling an outbreak relates to a nationally coordinated effort surrounding health care. We can see evidence for the paper's claim in South Korea's curve above. As we discussed, South Korea had one of the most coordinated national responses to the COVID-19 outbreak of any country (more details on its response can be found in the link above), and it appears to have made quite the difference. In fact, South Korea's preparedness was a direct result of the lessons it learned from MERS-CoV. For details, see [https://thebulletin.org/2020/03/south-korea-learned-its-successful-covid-19-strategy-from-a-previous-coronavirus-outbreak-mers/](http://)\n\nAt a high level, this illustrates the primary goal of the technique outlined in this notebook for obtaining useful information regarding COVID-19 risk factors from the enormous corpus of data available. The process is outlined below for anyone who wishes to use it (each step can be completed with only minor modifications of the code above):\n\n* Identify the risk factor that you would like to study. In our case, we focused on public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control.\n* Run Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the available corpus of data. Look at the topics created, and identify which one relates most closely to your chosen one.\n* Filter out the titles of your articles based on the top *n* (choice of *n* is left to the reader) words in your topic.\n* On the remaining paper titles, run a sentiment analysis, and view the top 20 most positive and most negative papers.\n* Manually determine and read/skim the papers which are most relevant to your topic of study.\n* Gather further data pertaining to your topic of study. In our case, this would be the data on confirmed cases of the virus, testing rates, and mitigation measures.\n* Conduct further exploratory data analysis with the aim of drawing a connection between what information is gleaned from the papers and what the additional data show."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Strengths and Limitations\n\nThe primary strengths of the approach outlined above center around its generality and effectiveness.

All three of these are other risk factors mentioned in the CORD-19 challenge, and an analagous process to the one carried out in this notebook can feasibly done for each of them. Furthermore, once the data is filtered, the sentiment analysis is reasonably likely to isolate relevant papers. Honing in on papers with high sentiment (whether positive or negative) prioritizes those whose titles likely convey something of substance about the desired topic (in particular because we run the sentiment analysis *after* LDA). Finally, comparing the findings with further data from other sources allows one to draw intriguing connections among the different aspects of the chosen topic, ideally learning something along the way.\n\nOf course, our approach has its weaknesses as well. The sentiment analysis we conduct works fairly well, but is not the ideal technique. There is a distinct possibility that some of the more \"scientifically-titled\" papers, so to speak, contain words not present in the VADER lexicon, and thus are assigned a sentiment of 0 despite being potentially useful (as 0 is neither low nor high in this setting, these papers are ignored). Beyond this, our process is also primarily qualitiative, and would benefit from an introduction of some probability. For example, our case study visualizations which plot measures taken in conjunction with confirmed cases do suggest a correlation between certain measures and a flattening of the curve, but it would be useful to somehow quantify the likelihood of a certain measure having this effect.\n\nThe weaknesses of our approach suggest potential future studies, which we discuss below."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion and Future Research\n\nOur primary goal in conducting this exploratory data analysis was to determine public health mitigation measures that may be effective for control of COVID-19. The data suggest two key findings: 1) early implementation of social distancing and lockdown measures appear to be correlated with a substantial slowdown in the spread rate of the virus, and 2) a coordinated national effort surrounding organization of a country's health care system (especially with regard to testing) can be instrumental in \"flattening the curve,\" as is commonly said nowadays.\n\nIn future notebooks, the analysis done here can be enhanced upon in a number of ways. In terms of the data visualizations, it would be tremendously useful for clarity purposes to create a plot which lists not only measure keywords, but (succinctly) displays detailed measures taken by different countries and states. For the analysis itself, the clear next step is to replace the sentiment analysis conducted after LDA with something more encompassing of all the data, so we do not gloss over potentially useful information. Once that is done, we will have a more refined dataset. The final step would then be to quantify the effect that different public health mitigation measures have on the growth curve of COVID-19 with a probabilistic model.\n\nLet us see what the future brings.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
