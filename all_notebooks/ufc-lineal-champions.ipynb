But we are now in the era of triple-C, Henry Cejudo, who is currently also the champion of the Bantamweight division as well.  The bantamweight division hasn't really had any overly dominant champions since its introduction to the UFC.    \n\nThe featherweight division was really run by Jose Aldo for a long time until Conor McGregor famously beat him in 13 seconds.    \n\nThe lightweight division is interesting because its title was vacant for about 4 years between 2002 and 2006!    \n\nIn the mid-range weight classes, there were two clearly historically dominant championship reigns: Georges St-Pierre's second championship reign in the welterweight division lasted 2,064 days and Anderson Silva's title reign in the middleweight division lasted 2,457 days! These are the number 1 and number 3 longest title reigns of all time.    \n\nMoving on to the light heavyweight division, this is clearly Jon Jones' world. He had the longest reign of all time, and the most consecutive title defenses in that division. And one could argue that if he didn't have to vacate his title twice (!), he would by far have the most dominant reign in the division, and perhaps the longest reign of all time across all divisions.    \n\nFinally, the heavyweight division is a bunch of killers, and that is clear from how short a typical title reign is and how much turnover there has been in the champion lineage.
