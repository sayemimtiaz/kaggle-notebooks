Many of these responses are tied to outdoor activities. I'm curious if more questions were added which were indoor activities, if then we would see some larger deviations in the other groups. This also makes me wonder about those who are 35+ who haven't broken broken bones and what makes that group unique. There are certainly more interesting tidbits that could be teased out of this data set.
