I was 10 years old. Along with my grandfather, I was burning all the dry leaves and twigs that were lying on our backyard. It was fun to do it! But, looking back I realise that I was unknowingly contributing to the air pollution problem in India.<br>    \n    <strong>Did my grandfather and I want to pollute the environment? Nope.</strong><br>\n    <strong>But were we? Yes.</strong><br>\n    Air pollution is an evil, but not necessarily a ploy of bad people. When countries and local industries are fighting for survival, they somehow tend to forget their obligations to the environment. It's not entirely their fault. Hence, I believe the strongest focus to deal with air pollution or any kind of pollution is to not place a ton of sanctions but to provide an alternative way for people to live the lives they dream of.\n</p>\nIn this notebook, I make an attempt to understand how investments can be made in order to minimize the effect of air pollution in a city. \n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>NOTE:</strong>\nThe work here is my interpretation of the data at hand. The recommendations I will suggest are based on what I find is true through my analysis. They need not necessarily resonate in the same tone with every reader.\n    \n    "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.halifax.ca/sites/default/files/pages/in-content/2018-06/Brush-Burning-HRM.jpg)\n<center><i>But, what if those twigs were being burnt because we needed warmth?

Sometimes, the level has been bad for human respiration and at other times, harmless. However, what if we hypothesized that the **AQI level of a city on day d depends on the AQI level of the same city on day (d-1)**. This does follow the Markovian property (though it is not completely based on it).  \n\nAQI of a city on any given day is a result of several factors like:\n- The population\n- The vehicles on the road\n- The industries\n- and others...\n\nMost of these factors will be common between days. Hence, if a particular city on a given day is on a given AQI level, there is a high chance it would remain in the same the next day. This helps to know a city is **bad** if this level is bad. But, it tells nothing about the **volatility of a city's AQI level**. Simply put, we want an ideal city that can change into an AQI level the next day if it has a bad one today. \n\n### The Method\n1. Convert the AQI levels in the dataset into 4 levels\n    - Good and Satisfactory => Level 1\n    - Moderate and Poor => Level 2\n    - Very Poor and severe => Level 3\n    - Not Available => Level 4\n2. Create a transition matrix showing the probability of a day in a city to change to a Level i if it i's currently in Level j\n3. Order the cities based on the probability for each city to transition from one level i to the next level j\n    - If i > j, it is an improvement\n    - If i < j, it is a deterioration\n4.

Having a high IALP indicates problems with the data collection of the city."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# convert to datetime\ncd['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(cd['Date'])\n\n# engineer into year, month\ndef ret_yr(x):\n    \n    return (x.strftime(\"%Y\"))\n\ndef ret_mon(x):\n    \n    return (x.strftime(\"%B\"))\n\ncd['Year'] = cd['Date'].apply(ret_yr)\ncd['Month'] = cd['Date'].apply(ret_mon)\n\n# convert to BTX\ncd['BTX'] = cd['Benzene'] + cd['Toluene'] + cd['Xylene']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def cnt_acc(series):\n    \n    return (list(series).count('Good') + (list(series).count('Satisfactory')))\n\ndef cnt_unacc(series):\n    \n    return (list(series).count('Moderate') + (list(series).count('Poor')) \n           + list(series).count('Very Poor') + list(series).count('Severe'))\n\ndef cnt_navail(series):\n    \n    return (list(series).count('Not Available'))\n\n# feature engineer\ncd_tot = cd.groupby(['City', 'Year'], as_index=False).agg({'Date':'count'})\ncd_tot.columns = ['City', 'Year', 'Recorded']\ncd_acc = cd.groupby(['City', 'Year'], as_index=False).agg({'AQI_Bucket':cnt_acc})\ncd_acc.columns = ['City', 'Year', 'Acceptable']\ncd_acc = cd_acc.drop(['City', 'Year'], axis=1)\ncd_unacc = cd.groupby(['City', 'Year'], as_index=False).agg({'AQI_Bucket':cnt_unacc})\ncd_unacc.columns = ['City', 'Year', 'Unacceptable']\ncd_unacc = cd_unacc.drop(['City', 'Year'], axis=1)\ncd_navail = cd.groupby(['City', 'Year'], as_index=False).agg({'AQI_Bucket':cnt_navail})\ncd_navail.columns = ['City', 'Year', 'Not Available']\ncd_navail = cd_navail.drop(['City', 'Year'], axis=1)\n\n# filter it\nyr_wise = pd.concat([cd_tot, cd_acc, cd_unacc, cd_navail], axis=1)\nfiltered = ['Ahmedabad', 'Patna', 'Delhi', 'Gurugram', 'Lucknow', 'Kolkata', 'Talcher', 'Guwahati']\nyr_wise_f = yr_wise[yr_wise['City'].isin(filtered)]\n\n# convert to percentages\nyr_wise_f['Acceptable_Percent'] = round((yr_wise_f['Acceptable'] / yr_wise_f['Recorded']) * 100, 2)\nyr_wise_f['Unacceptable_Percent'] = round((yr_wise_f['Unacceptable'] / yr_wise_f['Recorded']) * 100, 2)\nyr_wise_f['Not_Available_Percent'] = round((yr_wise_f['Not Available'] / yr_wise_f['Recorded']) * 100, 2)\n\nyr_wise_f['Year'] = yr_wise_f['Year'].astype('int')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the visualization below, each subplot represents a year.

However, to choose the most relevant cities to be provided the monetary investment, there is a need for comparing the filtered citites across other indicators. For this purpose, I am comparing the cities across 2 other indicators:\n* Per Capita Income of the City(In INR)\n* Population of Children under 6 years in the City\n\n📚 **RELEVANCE OF THESE METRICS**\n\nDirect consequences of air pollution are respiratory troubles and health disorders. Naturally, treating health issues is an expenditure. These treatments can at times be extra costs(or burden) on families that are not well off. Therefore, the **per capita income of a city** is a factor in deciding which city needs the investment to reduce air pollution and subsequently decrease medical expenditure due to respiratory problems.\n\nChildren are the most vulnerable of all age groups. Also, children have always been the most protected groups across human civilization. It is also a fact that children spend time outdoors playing games with their friends and tend to be in direct contact with air more. Therefore, cities with a larger **child population(under 6 years)** are to be given some consideration.\n\nFinally, cities with low per capita income and high child population is to be given a very high priority as these fall under a *region of urgency*. \n\n💾 **SOURCE OF DATA**\n\nThe two indicators used in this section have been compiled from the following sources:\n\n* Population of Children under 6 years in the City => [Top 500 Indian Cities - Based on 2011 Census](https://www.kaggle.com/zed9941/top-500-indian-cities)\n* Per Capita Income of the City(INR) => \n    - Compiled manually from multiple sources\n    - Ahmedabad: https://www.prsindia.org/sites/default/files/budget_files/State%20Budget%20Analysis%20-%20Gujarat%202020-21_Final.pdf\n    - Delhi: https://www.prsindia.org/sites/default/files/budget_files/Delhi%20Budget%20Analysis%20-%202019-20.pdf\n    - Gurgaon: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/work-career/best-cities-to-move-into-if-you-are-starting-a-new-career/gurgaon/slideshow/55224194.cms\n    - Patna: https://patna.nic.in/economy/#:~:text=As%20of%202015%2C%20GDP%20per,rate%20is%207.29%20per%20cent.\n    - Lucknow: https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kasganj-s-per-capita-gdp-fourth-highest-in-uttar-pradesh/story-8tSlU6yrjAeF9H92835X5I.html\n    \n❗ **DISCLOSURE**\n\nThe data above has been collected through multiple different sources as there was no single source to get this from.

There are 3 main kinds of areas where I feel the funding can be applied:\n\n![](https://github.com/ry05/aqi_project/blob/master/where_to_invest.png?raw=true)\n\n## Invest in Clean Technology\n\n**Clean technology** is any process, product or service that reduces negative environmental impacts through significant energy efficiency improvements, the sustainable use of resources, or environmental protection activities.([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology)). A couple of ways the *uncle* could invest his money would be to\n\n- Set up a Money-lending firm or bank\n    - Provide low-interest loans for people to convert their vehicles into CNG-run from petrol-run or diesel-run\n    - Provide incentives to those who are willing to give away their old fuel-driven vehicles and switch to electric-vehicles. The extra money could be used by the family for a purpose like long-term deposits for children\n- Launch an Electric Carpool Startup*ask \n    - The traditional carpool system with only electric cars\n    - Provide free rides and offers to attract people\n    - This can generate livelihood for cab-drivers without causing pollution to the environment\n    - Autorickshaw drivers can be targetted and brought into the revolution as [here](https://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/e-rickshaws-air-pollution-bengaluru-policy-transport-28136#:~:text=According%20to%20it%2C%20in%20a,sector%20is%200.44%20million%20tonne.)\n    - Under this startup, more solar-powered battery charge stations for any e-vehicle can be setup. This is important, sans this everything else fails\n\n## Invest in Community-driven Change\n\nInitiatives fail because people are not ready to accept it. People are not ready to accept because most initiatives and ideas are brought into effect without a public study or social research. Therefore, investment has to be put into creating an organization that would **ask people questions** and **act on their responses**. Basically, bring about effective change in existing behaviour of citizens, by involving them as key stakeholders in any relevant policy decision.\n\n- Ask the Right Questions\n    - Use social surveys to collect data\n    - Make data open, but maintain ethical standards\n    - Understand the *why* behind behaviours\n        - Why do people not change their polluting vehicles?\n        - Why do people not adhere to government regulations?\n        - Why do people not want to carpool?\n        - Is their cultural relevance to how people's lifestyles are?\n- Make People Responsible\n    - Involve local communities like for example, an apartment locality\n    - Make people take initiative, rather than wait for govt. policy\n\n## Invest in Making Connections\n\nAlone, it will be difficult to make a change. So, its important to form the right partnerships. Develop plans with corporations to help out as part of their CSR. Create accountability by keeping all transactions open and public.

In a real-world scenario, metrics need to be defined by taking way more parameters into consideration. Hence, I shall stop at these 3 simple metrics."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"h2\">References</div>\n\n### Domain Knowledge References\n1.
