They are used to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" that a user would give to an item.

The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. IMDB Top 250 is an example of this system.\n    Content-based recommenders: suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n    Collaborative filtering engines: these systems try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of other users. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"774dd690c61fd661e34f94d9000ba404b4e4dc4e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is a basic model of collabrative filtering."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nratings=pd.read_csv('../input/ratings.csv')\nratings.head(15)","execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"movies=pd.read_csv('../input/movies.csv')\nmovies.head(15)","execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"36014c62d5988ff8b9b061f927a4a1aadf324032"},"cell_type":"code","source":"movie_ratings = pd.merge(movies, ratings)\nmovie_ratings.head(15)","execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3925922bb01712a3bf00adb77a7b3573043985ea"},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings_matrix = ratings.pivot_table(index=['movieId'],columns=['userId'],values='rating').reset_index(drop=True)\nratings_matrix.fillna( 0, inplace = True )\nratings_matrix.head(15)","execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"402f33cd3380ae450fe974df01b1165e84cf0741"},"cell_type":"code","source":"movie_similarity=cosine_similarity(ratings_matrix)\nnp.fill_diagonal( movie_similarity, 0 ) \nmovie_similarity","execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a331a1ed99266995981dfd2ed993cc41d7bc744b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings_matrix = pd.DataFrame( movie_similarity )\nratings_matrix.head(15)","execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c4cadc2434e3190b29aafde4ee995f452ac39dc5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n    #user_inp=input('Enter the reference movie title based on which recommendations are to be made: ')\n    user_inp=\"Jumanji (1995)\"\n    inp=movies[movies['title']==user_inp].index.tolist()\n    inp=inp[0]\n    \n    movies['similarity'] = ratings_matrix.iloc[inp]\n    movies.head(5)\n    \nexcept:\n    print(\"Sorry, the movie is not in the database!\")\n    \nprint(\"Recommended movies based on your choice of \",user_inp ,\": \\n\", movies.sort_values( [\"similarity\"], ascending = False )[1:10])","execution_count":24,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
