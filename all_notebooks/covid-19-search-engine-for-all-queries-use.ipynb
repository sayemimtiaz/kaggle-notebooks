In the end i use the Google USE to  compare the similarity between the query and the documents and return the documents which are most similar to the query\n\n\n\n\n## About the Functions used\n\nFirst i converted all json to a single dataframe\n\nAfter that i combined the useful information like Title, Authors, Text etc.\n\nAfter that i striped them from garbage like next line, extra spacing, and converted the sentences to tokens, i.e. seperated each word from the sentence\n\nAfter that i converted each word to its Lemmatized form\n\n\nThe above mentioned operations took around **20-24 hours** excluding the time i had to restart because Kaggle only lets me run 9 hours consecutively, so i had to do it in iterations while saving the information\n\nThe Lemmatized information preprocessing is time taking, like i said 20 hours, that is why i have uploaded the dataset containing the Lemmatized words here:\n \n### www.kaggle.com/alizahidraja/covid19-allresearchpapers-lemmatizedinformation\n\n\n\n\nThen I trained the Google USE with my processed data and finethe similarity between the query and all the documents, and return the most similar documents\n\nThat's it!\n\nHope this search engine is of use to everyone who is working on these research papers\n\n\n\n## About the Author\nI am a 21 year old who hope to see the world free of this virus as soon as possible\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as
