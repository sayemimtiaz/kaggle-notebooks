However, this chapter also identifies seven other SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) strongly related to vaccines and six additional SDGs related to vaccines, leading to a total of 14 vaccine-related goals in 17 SDGs.\n\nTwo of these goals are related to innovation and technological development of vaccines (SDG9 and SDG17). The authors examine vaccine performance indicators and current technological and regulatory obstacles to achieve these goals, particularly affecting developing countries, and propose STI governance strategies to overcome these gaps and increase access to vaccines. Policy recommendations for vaccine funding and incentives for innovation, development, and vaccine production are made. Recommendations are also given for specific vaccine STI (Sexually transmitted infections) performance indicators and strategies to achieve the 14 vaccine-related SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/343763444_Vaccine_Innovation_and_Global_Sustainability_Governance_Challenges_for_Sustainable_Development_Goals"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"VACCINE UPRISING\n\nThe Vaccine Uprising was a popular riot between November 10 and 16, 1904 in the city of Rio de Janeiro , then the capital of Brazil . Its immediate pretext was a law that made vaccination against smallpox mandatory , but it is also associated with deeper causes, such as the urban reforms being carried out by Mayor Pereira Passos and the sanitation campaigns led by doctor Oswaldo Cruz .\n\nOswaldo Cruz, who took over the General Directorate of Public Health in 1903, was responsible for the city's sanitation campaign, which aimed to eradicate yellow fever, bubonic plague and smallpox. To this end, in June 1904, the government made a proposal for a law that made vaccination of the population mandatory. The law sparked heated debates between lawmakers and the population, and despite the strong opposition campaign, it was passed on. \n\nThe trigger of the revolt was the publication of a project to regulate the application of the mandatory vaccine in the newspaper A Notícias , on January 9, 1904.\n\nOn November 16, a state of siege and the suspension of mandatory vaccination was declared . Given the systematic and extinct repression of the triggering cause, the movement was ebbing. In the repression that followed the revolt, the police forces arrested a number of suspects and individuals considered disorderly, whether they were related to the revolt or not. The total balance was 945 people imprisoned on Ilha das Cobras , 30 dead, 110 injured and 461 deported to the state of Acre . https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolta_da_Vacina&prev=search&pto=aue\n\n![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KqXI33x9tmk/XEeqOl_82VI/AAAAAAAAXCQ/x5IoyAaf1dk5oD9TvMp7iZ_uUdyVEB_UwCLcBGAs/s640/charge%2Brevolta%2Bda%2Bvacina%2B7.PNG)suportegeografico77.blogspot.com"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Vaccines: Biotechnology Market, Coverage, and Regulatory Challenges for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals\n\nAuthors: Akira Homma, Cristina Possas, Adelaide Maria de Souza Antunes, Jorge Magalhães,et al.\n\nThat article provides an overview, from bioeconomic and global sustainability perspectives, of the main constraints to the current global vaccine innovation system for achieving Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs.

It will be necessary to ensure ample vaccine coverage and caution in the assessment of safety,  the most. \n\n\nTHE FAST-TRACK PROCESS\n\nThe fast-track process is necessary due to the urgency of the pandemic. But we will not have all the important information with this acceleration. The approval for the emergency use of vaccines responds to the anomalous situation that we live in, but caution is needed with the safety assessment.\n\nEfficacy results can be evaluated in a shorter time, using statistical instruments and comparing results in vaccinated and non-vaccinated people. The same is valid for safety data that refer to mild events, such as fever, pain located in the place of inoculation and tiredness. But this is not the case for rare events, which can be more serious and only become apparent with a much larger number of people vaccinated.\n\nFor this, there is stage four of vaccine development, when pharmacovigilance is carried out. For example, 10 million people are vaccinated, evaluated in a certain period of time. This is necessary because such effects, if any, will be detectable. We also do not know the duration of the immunity conferred. That is why vaccines, even if approved on an emergency basis, will continue to be evaluated.\n\nVaccines are among humanity's greatest achievements, but they are not trivial to develop. That is why there are so few. But so much money has never been invested, so much research has been done and there has been so much involvement by governments and institutions. I see with great hope the arrival of a first wave of vaccines against Covid-19.\nhttps://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/coronavirus/e-preciso-cautela-na-avaliacao-das-vacinas-afirma-especialista-24772505"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Janio Martinez https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/patient-charges-clustering-and-regression/notebook\n\n# Determine the distribution of charge\nseasonal_dist = df[\"seasonal_vaccine\"].values\nlogcharge = np.log(df[\"seasonal_vaccine\"])\n\n\n\ntrace0 = go.Histogram(\n    x=seasonal_dist,\n    histnorm='probability',\n    name=\"Seasonal Vaccine Distribution\",\n    marker = dict(\n        color = '#FA5858',\n    )\n)\ntrace1 = go.Histogram(\n    x=logcharge,\n    histnorm='probability',\n    name=\"Seasonal Vaccine Distribution using Log\",\n    marker = dict(\n        color = '#58FA82',\n    )\n)\n\nfig = tools.make_subplots(rows=2, cols=1,\n                          subplot_titles=('Seasonal Vaccine Distribution','Log Seasonal Vaccine Distribution'),\n                         print_grid=False)\n\n\n\nfig.append_trace(trace0, 1, 1)\nfig.append_trace(trace1, 2, 1)\n\n\nfig['layout'].update(showlegend=True, title='Seasonal Vaccine Distribution', bargap=0.05)\niplot(fig, filename='custom-sized-subplot-with-subplot-titles')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#To plot the Basic Distplot we need to remove Nan "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# categorical features with missing values\ncategorical_nan = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].isna().sum()>0 and df[feature].dtypes=='O']\nprint(categorical_nan)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#What can delay production in Brazil, by Diego Junqueira \n\nOne of the most complicated parts is production, “Pharmaceutical companies want to get this product to market quickly.

Identifying the right antigen or antigens can often take up to four years.\n\nPHASES 1/2A AND 2B: IS IT SAFE, AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT DOSE?\n\nPhase 1 testing marks the first time the vaccine is tested in a small group of adults, usually between 20 to 80 people, to evaluate its safety and measure the immune response it generates. Phase 2a studies aim to determine the most effective dose, and expand the safety experience with the vaccine.\n\nPHASE 3: HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE VACCINE?\n\nIn this stage of the clinical trial, even more volunteers receive the vaccine to study whether it's effective.\nBefore volunteers are vaccinated, they will be tested to make sure they currently do not have the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Half of the group will be assigned to receive the vaccine; the other half will receive a placebo. Then they will all be followed closely for up to two years to see if they do develop COVID-19-related symptoms, such as fever, headache, shortness of breath, dry cough or gastrointestinal distress.\n\nIt may be that some people do go on to develop COVID-19, even after having been vaccinated, but they may have substantially milder symptoms than those who develop COVID-19 in a control group.\n\nREGULATORY APPROVAL AND LICENSURE: IS IT READY FOR THE WORLD?\n\nAfter a successful Phase 3 trial, vaccine manufacturers submit an application to regulatory bodies such as the European Commission or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The problem in this case is that we may face a commercial dispute between countries for the raw material for the vaccine, which will be manufactured in different places around the world.\n\nAstrazeneca has already sold at least 1.2 billion doses of the Oxford vaccine, 800 million to rich countries, 100 million to Brazil and 300 million to Gavi - an international alliance that provides vaccines to poor countries.

So, we really have to make an unprecedented effort \n\n“What needs to enter people's minds is that, at first, there will not be a vaccine for everyone,” “I have been working for a long time in the area of access to medicine, I would say that the barriers in these first two years will be related to having the necessary quantities to vaccinate the most vulnerable groups”\nhttps://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://reporterbrasil.org.br/2020/08/vacina-da-covid-19-em-janeiro-saiba-o-que-pode-atrasar-a-producao-no-brasil/&prev=search&pto=aue"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.get_dummies(df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Must Encode to avoid errors"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Comparing Independent Categorical Variables (ANOVA)\n\nP-value: The p-value being higher than 0.05 tells us that we take the Null hypothesis, meaning that there is no a significant change between the age group when it comes to Income Poverty."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import ols\n\n\nmoore_lm = ols(\"age_group ~ income_poverty\", data=df).fit()\nprint(moore_lm.summary())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create subpplots\nf, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(18,8))\n\n# I wonder if the cluster that is on the top is from older people\nsns.stripplot(x=\"age_group\", y=\"h1n1_vaccine\", data=df, ax=ax1, linewidth=1, palette=\"Reds\")\nax1.set_title(\"Relationship H1N1 Vaccine and Age \")\n\n\nsns.stripplot(x=\"age_group\", y=\"h1n1_vaccine\", hue=\"chronic_med_condition\", data=df, ax=ax2, linewidth=1, palette=\"Set2\")\nax2.set_title(\"Medical Condition , Age  and H1N1 Vaccine\")\n\nsns.stripplot(x=\"h1n1_concern\", y=\"h1n1_vaccine\", hue=\"chronic_med_condition\", data=df, ax=ax3, linewidth=1, palette=\"Set2\")\nax3.legend_.remove()\nax3.set_title(\"H1N1 Concern and H1N1 Vacine\")\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = ff.create_facet_grid(\n    df,\n    x='chronic_med_condition',\n    y='h1n1_vaccine',\n    color_name='age_group',\n    show_boxes=False,\n    marker={'size': 10, 'opacity': 1.0},\n    #colormap={'55 -
