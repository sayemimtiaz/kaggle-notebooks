These policies are the best choice for the training period, but it is clear that they are not always optimal for the test period. \n\nI have also plotted the value of the HMM portfolio as a function of time for three different values of the friction rate. For the 0.5% the HMM strategy is able to grow even faster than the Bitcoin price during its climb and then avoid any long term losses whilst it declines. For the higher friction rates the HMM strategy follows Bitcoin during the climb  and manages to avoid some of the fall."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# back test\ndef back_test_pol(mdl,friction,Buy_Price,Sell_Price,Prices):\n    P=mdl.get_hidden_state_probabilities(Prices)\n    EAR=mdl.get_expected_abnormal_rates(Prices)\n    n=P.shape[0]\n    Portfolios=np.zeros((100,n,2))\n    Value=np.zeros((100,n))\n    for i in range(100):\n        buy=Buy_Price[i]\n        sell=Sell_Price[i]\n        rate=1-friction[i]\n        Portfolios[i,0,0]=1\n        a='c'\n        for t in range(n-1):\n            if a=='c' and EAR[t]>buy:\n                Portfolios[i,t,1]=rate*Portfolios[i,t,0]/Prices[t]\n                Portfolios[i,t,0]=0\n                a='b'\n            if a=='b' and EAR[t]<sell:\n                Portfolios[i,t,0]=rate*Portfolios[i,t,1]*Prices[t]\n                Portfolios[i,t,1]=0\n                a='c'\n            Portfolios[i,t+1]=Portfolios[i,t]\n        Value[i]=Portfolios[i,:,0]+Portfolios[i,:,1]*Prices\n    return Portfolios,Value","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Portfolios1,V1=back_test_pol(hmm,friction,Buy_Price,Sell_Price,BC_Prices)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ntrades_in_test_period0=np.sum(Portfolio0[train_end:-1]*Portfolio0[train_end+1:]>0)\nplt.semilogy(friction,V0[-1]/V0[train_end]*np.power(1-friction,ntrades_in_test_period0),label='previous day trend follower')\n\nplt.semilogy(friction,V1[:,-1]/V1[:,train_end],label='back-train optimized HMM buy/sell policy')\nplt.semilogy([0,np.max(friction)],[BC_Prices[-1]/BC_Prices[train_end],BC_Prices[-1]/BC_Prices[train_end]],label='Bitcoin investment')\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel('friction rate')\nplt.ylabel('back testing return')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"i=25\nplt.plot(range(train_end,ndays),V1[i,train_end:]/V1[i,train_end],label='HMM buy/sell policy')\nplt.plot(range(train_end,ndays),BC_Prices[train_end:]/BC_Prices[train_end],label='Bitcoin investment')\nplt.xlabel('day')\nplt.ylabel('portfolio value')\nplt.title('simulation with 0.5% market friction')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"i=50\nplt.plot(range(train_end,ndays),V1[i,train_end:]/V1[i,train_end],label='HMM buy/sell policy')\nplt.plot(range(train_end,ndays),BC_Prices[train_end:]/BC_Prices[train_end],label='Bitcoin investment')\nplt.xlabel('day')\nplt.ylabel('portfolio value')\nplt.title('simulation with 1% market friction')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"i=75\nplt.plot(range(train_end,ndays),V1[i,train_end:]/V1[i,train_end],label='HMM buy/sell policy')\nplt.plot(range(train_end,ndays),BC_Prices[train_end:]/BC_Prices[train_end],label='Bitcoin investment')\nplt.xlabel('day')\nplt.ylabel('portfolio value')\nplt.title('simulation with 1.5% market friction')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Training with simulated data\n\nI had originally planned to choose my trading policy using Reinforcement Learning to optimize the performance on simulated data sampled from the HMM.

The HMM is able to detect upwards and downwards trends in the data and this can be used to make trading decisions. In its current form my method is using the HMM as a feature extraction device rather than as a predictive model. I would really like to develop the modeling a bit further so that I get a HMM that can simulate data that looks more like the real time-series and allows for some more interesting predictive models and/or reinforcement learning. \n\nOne possibility is putting constraints or regularization on the NLL optimization to try and get models that switch more slowly between hidden states. I'm not sure of a principled way to approach this but will give it some thought. \n\nI also experimented with some different HMM structures. With two hidden states the model wanted growth and fast growth rather than growth and decline. Without the $\\beta r_{i-1}$ type term the state of the HMM is too simple to be able to make fine tuned decisions from.  \n\nThis is a work in progress and I hope to update it with some new ideas and neater/more efficient code in the future. If you have any comments please let me know. \n\nCheers\n\nJames"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
