when the dataset attributes go to different ranges like some attribute between [1-100], others [1000, 10000000], and others are different,  in this case of numerical ranges of different attributes, it's helpful to standardize all the numeric attributes to specific range always [0-1], which applied by the Max-Min function, which divides each value by max minus min which will restrict all values to be between 0 and 1, other function is using standard deviation and mean, but its goes to the different distribution of ranges. \n\nThis is help machine learning to perform well in this case of
