Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury.\n- Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.\n- Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years.\n\nThis, therefore, needs serious attention, as it concerns human lives which is irreplacable. It is possible, thanks to machine learning, to predict severity of car accidents as a result of the complex interplay of multitudes of factors like weather, road condition, light condition, speeding etc. and also to identify which factors are more important. The information thus gathered can be used to take preventive measurements.\n\n## Objective\n\nIn 2017, WHO released Save LIVES (a road safety technical package focuses on Speed management, Leadership, Infrastructure design and improvement, Vehicle safety standards, Enforcement of traffic laws and post-crash Survival) which synthesizes evidence-based measures that can significantly reduce road traffic fatalities and injuries.\n\nWhile the pursuit of saving lives is obvious, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has set an ambitious and quantifiable goal of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2020.\n\nAccording to the National Safety Council, traffic collisions cause more than 40,000 deaths and injure thousands of people every year across the United States. These are not traffic accidents, but entirely preventable tragedies.\n\nIn order to reduce accidents, we need to predict it based on the external parameters. Since the accident occurs due to very many factors (unsafe road infrastructure, light condition, vulnerable road users, speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol and other psychoactive substances, distracted driving, weather) prediction of accidental severity is a challenge. Machine Learning is ideally suited here as this is a scientific approach for modelling and predicting the parameter of interest demanding only a low budget.\n\nThe current project attempts to apply a machine learning technique to predict the severity of the accident given the parameters as stated before using car collision data for the city of Seattle, USA. Additionally, the accident data is extremely skewed (class imbalance), which makes the models heavily biased towards mild injuries. A practical methodology is used here to tackle this situation.\n\n\n## Interests\n\nThe practical utilities of the prediction, besides saving lives:\n\n- Safe route planning\n- Emergency vehicle allocation\n- Roadway design\n- Reduce property damage\n- Where to place additional signage (e.g. to warn for curves)\n\nStudy of accidents in one US city can definitely help any other city having similar characteristics. As car accidents are correlated to socioeconomic condition (according to WHO), the model developed cannot be used across countries but the same methodology can, of course, be utilised. The stakeholders of the present problem are federal, state and local government agencies, non-governmental organizations, regional authorities, and possible individuals (if this model is deployed as an app for personal use)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data\n\n## Acquisition\n\nThe car collision data is obtained from Seattle Govt’s website (Timeframe: 2004 to Present).\n\nData Source: http://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5b5c745e0f1f48e7a53acec63a0022ab_0/data\n\nData Catalogue: https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/GIS/Collisions_OD.pdf\n\n### Loading"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As the dataset is huge, instead of loading the entire data set, one might load a percentage of total observations by random sampling, or shuffle the data and take first n rows.
