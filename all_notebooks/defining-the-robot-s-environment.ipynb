In this problem, we may throw from any position in the room but the probability of it is relative to the current distance from the bin and the direction in which the paper is thrown. Therefore the actions available are to throw the paper in any 360 degree direction or move to a new position to try and increase the probability that a throw made will go into the bin.\n\nWe first introduce the problem where the bin's location is known and can be solved directly with Value-Itearation methods before showing how RL can be used similarly to find the optimal policy if the probabilities are hidden in later notebooks.\n\nFurthermore, we introduce the option to add control to the environment where, for example, we can punish the algorithm less for missed throws so that the algorithm will take higher risks.\n\nLastly, we demonstrate how the envrionment can be changed and, for example, may have walls blocking throws from certain positions. \n\nI will also be publishing an accompanying article explaining the process without code that can be found on my website or Medium page:\n\nhttps://www.philiposbornedata.com/\n\nhttps://medium.com/@philiposbornedata\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5fef4e0fa1a3128b969d93e8f61bf7445e92ee2e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 1: Defining the Environment\n\nThe environment's probabilities are calcualted based on the direction in which the paper is thrown and the current distance from the bin. \n\nFor example, in the image below we have three people labelled A, B and C. A and B both throw in the correct direction but person A is closer than B and so will have a higher probability of landing the shot. \n\nPerson C is closer than person B but throws in the completely wrong direction and so will have a very low probability of hitting the bin. This may seem illogical that person C would throw in this direction but, as we will show more later, an algorithm has to try a range of directions first to figure out where the successes are and will have no visual guide as to where the bin is. \n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1fb9b82ba07f231bd5135f7383df48b9d6c10ce3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Enironment Demo](https://i.imgur.com/3woVbKI.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"232dc537fb56ed633dfd2471a0a72db5f1d579cc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To create the environment in python, we convert the diagram into 2-d dimensions of x and y values and use bearing mathematics to calculate the angles thrown. We used normalised x and y values so that they must be between 0 and 10 (or 0 and -10) as whole numbers.\n\n\n### 1.1 Distance Measure\nWe can plot this and show person's A position in this definition to be (-0.5,-0.5). This is their current state and their distance from the bin can be calculated using the Euclidean distance measure:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n distance(State,Bin) = \\sqrt{(State_x-Bin_x)^2 + (State_y-Bin_y)^2}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand in our case, we have:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n distance(A, Bin) = \\sqrt{(-0.5-0)^2 + (-0.5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.7071\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor the final calcualtions, we normalise this and reverse the value so that a high score indicates that the person is closer to the target bin:\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n distance\\_score(State, Bin) = 1-\\frac{distance(State,Bin)}{Max\\_dist(State,Bin)} \n\\end{equation}\n\nBecause we have fixed our 2-d dimensions between (-1, 1), the max posssible distance the person could be is $ \\sqrt{(1) + (1)} = \\sqrt{2}$ from the bin. Therefore our distance score for person A is:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n distance\\_score(A, Bin) = 1-\\frac{\\sqrt{0.5}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n### 1.2 Direction Measure\n\nPerson A then has a decision to make, do they move or do they throw in a chosen direction. For now, let imagine they choose to throw the paper, their first throw is at 50 degrees and the second is 60 degrees from due north. The direction of the bin from person A can be calculated by simple trigonometry:\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n direction(A, bin) = tan^{-1}(0.5/0,5) = 45 \\ degrees\n\\end{equation}\n\nTherefore, the first throw is 5 degrees off the true direction and the second is 15 degrees.\n\nWhen we consider that good throws are bounded by 45 degrees either side of the actual direction (i.e. not throwing the wrong way) then we can use the following to calculate how good this chosen direction is. Any direction beyond the 90 degress will produce a negative value and be mapped to probability of 0:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n dir\\_score(State, Throw\\_action) =  \\frac{45 - |True\\_dir - Actual\\_dir|}{45}  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n dir\\_score(A, Throw_1) = \\frac{ 45 - |45 - 50|}{45} \\approx 0.8889\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n dir\\_score(A, Throw_2) =  \\frac{45 - |45 - 60|}{45} \\approx 0.6667  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\nBoth are fairly close but their first throw is more likely to hit the bin. \n\n### 1.3 Probability Calculation\n\nWe therefore calculate our probability of a successful throw to be relative to both these measures:\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n prob\\_success(State, Throw\\_action) = distance\\_score*dir\\_score  \n\\end{equation}\n\n\nWhich we have for person A's first throw to be:\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n prob\\_success(A, Throw_1) = 0.5*0.9722 \\approx 0.4444  \n\\end{equation}\n\nand the second to be:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n prob\\_success(A, Throw_1) = 0.5*0.9167 \\approx 0.3333\n\\end{equation}\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"52d30cdf1d1683be612f0a7c7e481f7c85f1a098"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5c15b022ba73f0ca975ce7cbcdb2a2b9a53758a7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nbin_x = 0\nbin_y = 0\n\nstarting_position_x = -5\nstarting_position_y = -5\n\nplt.scatter(bin_x, bin_y, label = \"Bin\")\nplt.scatter(starting_position_x, starting_position_y, label = \"A\")\nplt.ylim([-10,10])\nplt.xlim([-10,10])\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1a3108b0eba54c65b1b0a04787b378e7af3ad82d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To make things easier for continuous runs, we combine these calculations into a single function. The distance score is calcualted as before and we make sure to account for a bin being placed is other locations.\n\nThe direction score calculations are a little harder to generalise. In our example person A is south-west from the bin and therefore the angle was a simple calculation but if we applied the same to say a person placed north-east then this would be incorrect. Furthermore, because the bin can be placed anywhere we need to first find where the person is relative to this, not just the origin, and then used to to establish to angle calcuation required. \n\nThis is summarised in the diagram below where we have generalised each of the trignomertric calculations based on the person's relative position to the bin:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a068dfe983d3886daad8b8c922ca3d4eed8c81d1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lCNiiwf.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0a0ba794e8cb85cf84c2f1480786857694ec2c72"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.4 Probability Function \n\nWith this diagram in mind, we create a function that calculates the probability of a throw's success from only given position relative to the bin.\n\nFirst, if the position is the same as the bin (i.e. the person is directly inside the bin already) then the probability is fixed to 100%. \n\nNext, we have to re-define the throwing direction in two cases to accomodate for the fact that 360 degrees is the same as 0 degrees. For example, if we are south-west of the bin and throw 350 degrees, this would be the same as -10 degrees and would then relate to a bearing from the person to the bin less than 90 correctly.\n\nThen the euclidean distance is calculated followed by the max distance a person could be from the bin.\n\nWe then calculate the bearing from the person to the bin following the previous figure and calcualte the score bounded within a +/- 45 degree window. Throws that are closest to the true bearing score higher whilst those further away score less, anything more than 45 degrees (or less than -45 degrees) are negative and then set to a zero probability. \n\nLastly, the overall probability is related to both the distance and direction given the current position.

Environment with Known Probabilities\n\n### 2.1 Model-based Methods\nThe aim is for us to find the optimal action in each state by either throwing or moving in a given direction. Because we have known probabilities, we can actually use model-based methods and will demonstrate this first and can use value iteration to achieve this via the following formula:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    Q_{k+1}(s,a) =  \\sum^{s'}{P(s'|s,a) (R(s,a,s')+ γVk(s'))} \\ for \\ k ≥ 0\n\\end{equation}\nwhere\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_k(s) = max_a \\ Qk(s,a) \\ for \\ k>0.\n\\end{equation}\n\n$P(s'|s,a)$ is the probability of reaching the next state given the current state and action. We have defined this as 1 for movement actions and calculated by the probability function otherwise.\n\n$R(s,a,s')$ corresponds to the reward for reaching the next state given the current state and action. \n\nGamma will effect what our algorithm values more important whether it be short of long term rewards and a value close to 1 will value long term rewards more.\n\nValue iteration starts with an arbitrary function V0 and uses the following equations to get the functions for k+1 stages to go from the functions for k stages to go (https://artint.info/html/ArtInt_227.html).\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3aa8039a8f02061deb73a33663f91160a0a901f3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.2 Initialise State-Action Pairs\nBefore applying the algorithm, we intialise each state-action value into a table. First we formthis for all throwing actions then all moving actions. \n\nWe can throw in any direction and therefore there are 360 actions for each degree starting from north as 0 clockwise to 359 degrees. \n\nAlthough movement may seem simpler in that there are 8 possible actions (north, north east, east, etc) there are complications in that unlike being able to throw in any direction from any position, there are some movements that aren't possible. For example, if we are at the edge of the room, we cannot move beyong the boundary and this needs to be accounted for. Although this could be coded nicer, I have done this manually with the if/elif statements shown that skips the row if the position and movement is not possible. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d120ad89365629439556b52f11a2396b29e7a226"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Define Q(s,a) table by all possible states and THROW actions initialised to 0\nQ_table = pd.DataFrame()\nfor z in range(0,360):\n    throw_direction = int(z)\n    for i in range(0,21):\n        state_x = int(-10 + i)\n        for j in range(0,21):\n            state_y = int(-10 + j)\n            reward = 0\n            Q = pd.DataFrame({'throw_dir':throw_direction,'move_dir':\"none\",'state_x':state_x,'state_y':state_y,'Q':0, 'reward': reward}, index = [0])\n            Q_table = Q_table.append(Q)\nQ_table = Q_table.reset_index(drop=True)\nprint(\"Q table 1 initialised\")\nQ_table.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b9c27c59faf1bfa3cf1e2b7528f17fcc0a23ab48"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Define Q(s,a) table by all possible states and MOVE actions initialised to 0\n\nfor x in range(0,21):\n    state_x = int(-10 + x)\n    for y in range(0,21):\n        state_y = int(-10 + y)\n        for m in range(0,8):\n            move_dir = int(m)\n            \n            # skip impossible moves starting with 4 corners then edges\n            if((state_x==10)&(state_y==10)&(move_dir==0)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_x==10)&(state_y==10)&(move_dir==2)):\n                continue\n                \n            elif((state_x==10)&(state_y==-10)&(move_dir==2)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_x==10)&(state_y==-10)&(move_dir==4)):\n                continue\n                \n            elif((state_x==-10)&(state_y==-10)&(move_dir==4)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_x==-10)&(state_y==-10)&(move_dir==6)):\n                continue\n                \n            elif((state_x==-10)&(state_y==10)&(move_dir==6)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_x==-10)&(state_y==10)&(move_dir==0)):\n                continue\n                \n            elif((state_x==10) & (move_dir == 1)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_x==10) & (move_dir == 2)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_x==10) & (move_dir == 3)):\n                continue\n                 \n            elif((state_x==-10) & (move_dir == 5)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_x==-10) & (move_dir == 6)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_x==-10) & (move_dir == 7)):\n                continue\n                 \n            elif((state_y==10) & (move_dir == 1)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_y==10) & (move_dir == 0)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_y==10) & (move_dir == 7)):\n                continue\n                 \n            elif((state_y==-10) & (move_dir == 3)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_y==-10) & (move_dir == 4)):\n                continue\n            elif((state_y==-10) & (move_dir == 5)):\n                continue\n                 \n            else:\n                reward = 0\n                Q = pd.DataFrame({'throw_dir':\"none\",'move_dir':move_dir,'state_x':state_x,'state_y':state_y,'Q':0, 'reward': reward}, index = [0])\n                Q_table = Q_table.append(Q)\nQ_table = Q_table.reset_index(drop=True)\nprint(\"Q table 2 initialised\")\nQ_table.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7dbddd554c80100c9df6933c05fbf3107c81f8bb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Q_table[(Q_table['state_x']==-10) &(Q_table['throw_dir']==\"none\")].head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8075ae0b76bc5ea0259784661c60e24c3aed5c6e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.3 Value-Iteration Optimal Policy\n\nWe start by initialising V(s) for all states, calculate the Q(s,a) matrix from this then update V(s) accordingly. This is repeated back and forth until the results converge. \n\nNext, we calculate the probability of each state-action pair using the function introduced previously if a thrown action or simply 1 if a move action.\n\nWe are now ready to apply the Value-Iteration and introduce the two parameters gamma and the number of iterations/repeats. Gamma will effect what our algorithm values more important whether it be short of long term rewards and a value close to 1 will value long term rewards more.\n\n*\"Different values of gamma may produce different policies. Lower gamma values will put more weight on short-term gains, whereas higher gamma values will put more weight towards long-term gains. Asymptotically, the closer gamma is to 1, the closer the policy will be to one that optimizes the gains over infinite time. On the other hand, value iteration will be slower to converge.*\n\n*The best gamma depends on your domain. Sometimes it makes sense to look for short term gains (e.g. money gained sooner is actually more valuable than the same amount earned later), other times you want to look as far ahead as you can. And i would say that for a given MDP, there is probably a point (for high values of gamma) where the optimal policies will stabilize (no longer change when you increase gamma even more).\"* https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/137590/mdp-value-iteration-choosing-gamma\n\nThe number of iterations required to converge depends entirely on the scale of the problem, we will simply try some reasonable values and then observe the results after to find the optimal value. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b8bb36afc00200127857c724467f7e540ee2a09f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Q_table_VI = Q_table.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1943245836121edf32c9dc078f28c70b5b5939b0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Q_table_VI['V'] = 0","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"08c908fb75b5489ca8019b774eab96ed375eb751"},"cell_type":"code","source":"bin_x = 0\nbin_y = 0\n\nprob_list = pd.DataFrame()\nfor n,action in enumerate(Q_table_VI['throw_dir']):\n    # Guarantee 100% probability if movement\n    if(action == \"none\"):\n        prob = 1\n    # Calculate if thrown\n    else:\n        prob = probability(bin_x, bin_y, Q_table_VI['state_x'][n], Q_table_VI['state_y'][n], action)\n    prob_list = prob_list.append(pd.DataFrame({'prob':prob}, index = [n] ))\nprob_list = prob_list.reset_index(drop=True)\nQ_table_VI['prob'] = prob_list['prob']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b02ae233c0e6dd1fb324e9e2fcfa856076f1a0e7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Q_table_VI.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9707dc94c0e53d53ca6005cde283c267b4e72aaf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Q_table_VI[ (Q_table_VI['state_x']==-1) & (Q_table_VI['state_y']==-1) & (Q_table_VI['throw_dir']==45)]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4febce88000bca36d80a08a6a12b4c7c845e320e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Extra Code Features: Tracking loop progress and run-time\nTo improve our code, we introduce two useful tools for keep track of the run time.

Therefore, we will map each optimal action to a vector of u and v and use these to create a quiver plot (https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.quiver.html). \n\nFirst, we map the move direction to its x and y components and set the actions which are throwing (currently labelled as \"none\") in column to a very large negative integer so we do not have issues when we want to scale the values in the column by a factor. If we didnt do this we would recieve an error as we would be trying to divide a string element by a number and this isn't possible. We repeat this for the throw direction column as well.\n\nWe then define the scale of the arrows and use this to define the horizontal component labelled u. For movement actions, we simply multiply the movement in the x direction by this factor and for the throw direction we either move 1 unit left or right (accounting for no horizontal movement for 0 or 180 degrees and no vertical movement at 90 or 270 degrees). \n\nThe horizontal component is then used to calculate the vertical component with some basic trigonometry where we again account for certain angles that would cause errors in the calculations.

shows the optimal policy defining the best action at each state. \n\nThis may seem unusual at first as, for example, state (-10,0) seems as though it should move directly east if it wants to reach the goal faster but if we count the number of steps, as shown below, this is equal.\n\nIn fact, there are a number of optimal actions for many of the move states. Any state nots in the diagonal streams can move in any direction that tends towards to bin and still be optimal. i.e. state (-10,0) can move north-east, east or south-east and still be an optimal action.
