The goal is to better understand the causes of bird strikes and propose actionable recommendations to prevent such events.\n\n## Descriptive Statistics <a name=\"descriptive\"></a>\n\nIn this section, a series of descriptive analyses will be performed with the data to better understand the seven aforementioned aspects of bird strikes. \n\n### Data Import\n\nThe bird strikes data set is imported into Python. The first five rows of data are shown.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"b54528b2-c792-4b80-b6d8-3693dcef1341","_uuid":"5dc05cc394daa6a1e53ebee457ea8b48c82b5d9b"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"# import libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom pandas import concat\nfrom pandas import Series, DataFrame\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# machine learning\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import scale\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 100)","execution_count":1},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"ce52483b-a823-4b09-a306-a8c38785c23d","_uuid":"cb9e48c3d04845c51f00265116ca3c00ee149595"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"# import in the bird strikes data set\nbird = pd.read_csv(\"../input/Bird Strikes Test.csv\", low_memory=False, thousands=',')\n# only drop rows that are all NA:\nbird = bird.dropna(how='all')","execution_count":2},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"8d8cc9c5-5be1-4f5c-b102-f495a59f0c9b","_uuid":"d3dfb3eb95a76cdce4d62e661aabc6798472d468"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"# take a look at the first 5 rows of data\nbird.head()","execution_count":3},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"73761988-dd12-497d-b663-49e153a903de","_uuid":"abe7d5d23a44611dde2a07cdfd2080f10fa9917f"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Information on each variable in the data is shown below.

Is it because the airport happens to be in the route of migration for some medium and large-size bird species, or because the airport is not doing a good job controlling bird population, or simply because there are more air traffic in that state?\n\n### What times do bird strikes occur? <a name=\"descriptive6\"></a>\n\nThree variables, including _FlightDate_, _When: Time (HHMM)_, and _When: Time of day_, are used to answer this question. First, the flight date variable is engineered into two features: the year of the flight and the month of the flight. Year information can be used to understand the trend of bird strikes over time, while the month information along with migration input can be used to understand whether bird migration plays a key role in bird strikes.\n\nFirst, a heatmap of strike frequency over flight month and flight year is shown for all strikes:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"39ee1944-b0a0-4c42-bc03-4c326ba96be9","_uuid":"bd827097c948f27026a2e3e419a23dd7061cb07a"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"# month variable\nbird['Flight Month'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(bird['FlightDate']).month\n# year variable\nbird['Flight Year'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(bird['FlightDate']).year\n\n# subset the data with any damage or negative impact to the flight\nbird_dmg = bird.loc[(bird['Effect: Indicated Damage'] != 'No damage') | \n                    (bird['Cost: Total $'] > 0) ]","execution_count":36},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"6a29ae6e-712e-4af1-8802-00721770d47b","_uuid":"7dfff46ddd8baad1290226eed57ce63529b02d2c"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"# count over flight month and year\ncount_time = DataFrame({'count' : bird.groupby( ['Flight Month', 'Flight Year'] ).size()}).reset_index()\n# reshape frame\ncount_time_p=count_time.pivot(\"Flight Month\", \"Flight Year\", \"count\")\n# plot the frequency over month and year in a heat map\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 7))\nheat_time = sns.heatmap(count_time_p);\nheat_time.set_title('The Frequency of All Strikes Over Flight Year and Month');","execution_count":37},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"19221afb-70cd-4e84-a637-a70435d6ec6b","_uuid":"87ca7ff7791f6dd4b43f9200c4691ef344aba322"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then a heatmap of strike frequency over flight month and flight year is shown for damaging strikes only:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"b508a756-ea93-4789-a001-cb85dde91d50","_uuid":"8144fd83671d6a1d40d0d7190dc3ec6876159396"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"# count over flight month and year\ncount_time0 = DataFrame({'count' : bird_dmg.groupby( ['Flight Month', 'Flight Year'] ).size()}).reset_index()\n# reshape frame\ncount_time_p0=count_time0.pivot(\"Flight Month\", \"Flight Year\", \"count\")\n# plot the frequency over month and year in a heat map\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 7))\nheat_time0 = sns.heatmap(count_time_p0);\nheat_time0.set_title('The Frequency of Damaging Strikes Over Flight Year and Month');","execution_count":38},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","collapsed":false,"_cell_guid":"53260967-8302-4520-97b4-7673cd34e184","_uuid":"1896be2573102faa019416332a1f97a47c3853de"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Together, the above analyses show that bird strikes happen mostly between July and October, with an increasing trend from year 2000 to year 2011.

Two-engine aircrafts are most frequently struck, but one-engine aircrafts are more prone to damage once struck. Such aircrafts should be equipped and operated with caution on this regard.\n2. Small birds are the most frequently involved in bird strikes, but medium and large birds are more damaging once involved. Airports built near migration route of medium to large-size birds should have more countermeasures in place.\n3. Bird strikes happen most often during takeoff or landing, especially the approach phase (when few countermeasures are in place), and during low altitude and low speed flights. Pilots should be informed with bird information during the approach phase if possible.\n4. Sacramento International Airport stands out as the airport with most damaging bird strikes. More information on the airport would be needed to understand the cause, e.g. bird migration routes, airport traffic, bird control measures etc.\n5. Bird strikes happen mostly between March to May, and July to October, between 5am and 1am of the next day. If resources are limited, detection and countermeasures should be optimized during such times to prevent bird strikes as much as possible.\n6. Most of the strikes do not cause damages. However, bird strikes can cost money and even human lives at times.\n7. Among the models tested, logistic regression model outperforms other models and can be chosen as a model for prediction and warning system for pilots and other operators. However, missing data is a huge issue with this data set, it would be useful to have the records as complete as possible so that a higher prediction accuracy can be achieved.","execution_count":null}],"nbformat":4}
