It tests for grammar and ability in both English and mathematics.  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test  \nhttp://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/resources/testing/SHSAT.htm"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"77af80ebd815e280ec06d6764322fb92416c2e9f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem Statement\nPASSNYC and its partners provide outreach services that **improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in these specialized high schools.** The current process of identifying schools is effective, but PASSNYC could have an even greater impact with a more informed, granular approach to quantifying the potential for outreach at a given school. Proxies that have been good indicators of these types of schools include data on English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities, Students on Free/Reduced Lunch, and Students with Temporary Housing.\n\nPart of this challenge is to **assess the needs of students by using publicly available data to quantify the challenges they face in taking the SHSAT.** The best solutions will enable PASSNYC to **identify the schools where minority and underserved students stand to gain the most from services like after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents.**\n\nFrom the disscusion someone gives more details to help understand the task.  \n<font color=\"blue\">@Max B:</font>  \nOnly a third (roughly) of eligible students take the SHSAT, and our goal is to drive more test takers (you can't get in if you don't sit for the test!). The education space is full of non-profits like ours with limited resources. So the research question is, given limited resources, where (at which schools) can you target your intervention efforts to make an impact on those participation numbers.  \nThe hypothesis is that using what we know about students/schools who do take the test, we can find similar students/schools and rank them on their likelihood/opportunity of converting into test-takers.  \nA complicated machine learning model isn't necessarily going to win this challenge because this isn't like the traditional machine learning competitions you're probably used to seeing. As you said, there's no ground truth -- there's also no score board and the dataset is a patchwork of different sources. This is a real-life problem that starts from the beginning and if you just got hired as PASSNYC's newest Data Scientist, this is what you would be working on.  \nIt doesn't matter which method you use to solve the problem, the most important thing is to show that you've done your homework and convince PASSNYC that your solution will get more students taking the SHSAT.  \n\n<font color=\"blue\">@Chris Crawford:</font>  \n\"Which schools have students that would benefit from outreach services and lead to a more diverse group of students taking the SHSAT and being accepted into New York City's Specialized High Schools.\"  \n&nbsp;  \nIn this notebook we'd like to explore and analysis data by the following steps:  \n1. Exploration on the schools whose grade 8 students don't take SHSAT. SHSAT targets for the 8th and 9th grade students residing in New York City. But we observe that there're some schools having no students taking the exams. We are curious about it and data exploraration would help us better understand.  \n2. School Categorization: we caculate the participation rate and excellent rate for each school in the exams. And based on the BCG Matrix theory, we can divide them into 4 categories: Star, Cash Cow, Dog and Question mark. A similar analysis was done to evaluation the diversity (i.e. the performance of Black/Hispanic students in the exams)  \n3. Other resource: we use multiple datasets to know more about schools and students such as the proportion of Black and Hispanic students, the evaluation of school safety and its relation with education quality and so on."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"42b2f7b70c0ea5a13ab8ce91566e7851f6072794"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The content of this notebook\n### [1.

They have fewer community schools and mainly locate in the center of the city. Although the region in the center of the city often has a higher Economic Need Index, but statistics analysis shows that schools of group2 has a lower Economic Need Index than those of group1. It means they don't need help as much as schools of group1.  \n2. For race/ethnical distribution, based on the independent t-test, we found that there exists significant differences in \"Percent Black\" and \"Percent Hispanic\" between the two groups. Schools in group2 have a greater percentage of Black students and a smaller percentage of Hispanic students.  \n3. Schools in group2 have better performance on all of the 6 evaluation indexes on average, including Rigorous Instruction %, Collaborative Teachers %, Supportive Environment %, Effective School Leadership %, Strong Family-Community Ties % and Trust %. It means that they have better environment and facilities for studying.  \n4. For student achievement rating, schools of group2 have a higher percentage of \"Exceeding Target\" and all of them meet the targets. And they often have a higher Average ELA Proficiency and Average Math Proficiency than Group1. What's more, they also have a higher Student Attendace Rate and lower Percentage of student chronically absence.  \n\n**Based on these findings ,here we make a hypothesis that grade 8 students of the group2 schools didn't take the SHSAT because they have multiple choises when they graduate. They're much more outstanding, richer and have a better environment for studying. Still need more relevant data to support and confirm.**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"178d5e47e5082a1abfc45af92321d65cc7d5eb24"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='2'></a>\n## 2.
