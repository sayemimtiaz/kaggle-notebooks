In this example we will use hypertension. Hope it helps - please up vote if it does.\n\nAn odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome. The OR represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. Odds ratios are most commonly used in case-control studies, however they can also be used in cross-sectional and cohort study designs as well (with some modifications and/or assumptions).[read more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938757/)\n\nIn the CORD19 documents OR will often be presented in the text of the document something like this\n\nhypertension [or=2.3 [95% ci (1.76, 3.00), p<0.01]\n\nHere is an example of the hypertension OR data from the Kaggle.com contibutions page so you can see what we are looking to accomplish. [see OR example](https://www.kaggle.com/covid-19-contributions#Hypertension)\n\nOk let's get started and load the required python packages."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport functools\nimport re\nprint ('packages loaded')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Next we load the full text articles from the CORD19 dataset but keep only those documents related to COVID-19"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# keep only documents with covid -cov-2 and cov2\ndef search_focus(df):\n    dfa = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('covid')]\n    dfb = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('-cov-2')]\n    dfc = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('cov2')]\n    dfd = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('ncov')]\n    frames=[dfa,dfb,dfc,dfd]\n    df = pd.concat(frames)\n    df=df.drop_duplicates(subset='title', keep=\"first\")\n    return df\n\n# load the meta data from the CSV file using 3 columns (abstract, title, authors),\ndf=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/metadata.csv', usecols=['title','journal','abstract','authors','doi','publish_time','sha','full_text_file'])\nprint ('ALL CORD19 articles',df.shape)\n#fill na fields\ndf=df.fillna('no data provided')\n#drop duplicate titles\ndf = df.drop_duplicates(subset='title', keep=\"first\")\n#keep only 2020 dated papers\ndf=df[df['publish_time'].str.contains('2020')]\n# convert abstracts to lowercase\ndf[\"abstract\"] = df[\"abstract\"].str.lower()+df[\"title\"].str.lower()\n#show 5 lines of the new dataframe\ndf=search_focus(df)\nprint ('Keep only COVID-19 related articles',df.shape)\n\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom copy import deepcopy\nimport math\n\n\ndef format_body(body_text):\n    texts = [(di['section'], di['text']) for di in body_text]\n    texts_di = {di['section']: \"\" for di in body_text}\n    \n    for section, text in texts:\n        texts_di[section] += text\n\n    body = \"\"\n\n    for section, text in texts_di.items():\n        body += section\n        body += \"\\n\\n\"\n        body += text\n        body += \"\\n\\n\"\n    \n    return body\n\n\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    if ';' not in row['sha'] and os.path.exists('/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'+row['full_text_file']+'/'+row['full_text_file']+'/pdf_json/'+row['sha']+'.json')==True:\n        with open('/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'+row['full_text_file']+'/'+row['full_text_file']+'/pdf_json/'+row['sha']+'.json') as json_file:\n            data = json.load(json_file)\n            body=format_body(data['body_text'])\n            keyword_list=['TB','incidence','age']\n            #print (body)\n            body=body.replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n            text=row['abstract']+' '+body.lower()\n\n            df.loc[index, 'abstract'] =text\n\ndf=df.drop(['full_text_file'], axis=1)\ndf=df.drop(['sha'], axis=1)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Now we will \"focus\" the dataframe to make sure it has hypertension in the text -
