People with underlying co-morbidities including chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy, obesity and dementia.With help from medical experts, the government has also identified people who are at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 - these are people who are in the extremely clinically vulnerable/ high risk group and are shielding.\n\n\nThis information is not final - the work of the committee is ongoing and they will consider additional risk factors like ethnicity and gender (as well as many others) as more information becomes available.

It is not effective for people with mild symptoms (those who do not need help with their breathing). In the rare cases where a person becomes seriously unwell, their body produces excessive and damaging inflammation as they try to fight off the virus. This is known as a cytokine storm, and in people with COVID-19 leads to severe inflammation in the lungs – making it difficult to breathe. Dexamethasone works by reducing this inflammation. But for people who are not experiencing a cytokine storm, reducing the activity of the immune system makes it more difficult for the body to fight off infections. \n\nThere is no evidence that taking steroids for Crohn’s or Colitis will protect you from COVID-19, as dexamethasone only works for people who need help with their breathing. The timing and dosage of dexamethasone to treat COVID-19 is very different to how steroids are given to treat Crohn's and Colitis.
