We found out that:\n- The total number of bookings in 2020 was 75% less than in 2019, breaking a rapid growing trend. The number of listings that got at least 1 review was half.\n- Boroughs popular with tourists like Westminster and Kensington, and trendy areas like Tower Hamlets and Hackney were the most affected.\n- Entire Homes, which are the most popular option in central touristy areas, and hotels had the highest decrease in price. Prices in Private Rooms, which are the majority in the rest of London had a lower drop. Prices in Shared Rooms increased slightly, though this option remains the least popular.\n\nIdeas to expand this project include:\n- Analyse the change in price per accommodation type per borough.\n- Compare the impact on London with other cities. Data is publicly available on [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/).\n- Compare the impact on the Airbnb Market with the impact on the housing market."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
