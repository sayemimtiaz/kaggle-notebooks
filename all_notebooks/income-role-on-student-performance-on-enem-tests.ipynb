ENEM is the front door to joining the university, much like the SAT in the USA, and is taken by almost all students who intend to go to college. In this notebook we answer the following questions:\n\n* How is the distribuition of Income across school types, though?\n* How is the correlation between grades and income on each school type?\n* How much can student performance be explained by their school quality?\n* Is income a factor inside a school?\n* How is student income related to their distribuition among schools?\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install seaborn -U --quiet","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\n\nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n\nplt.style.use('seaborn')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"id_columns = [\n    'NU_INSCRICAO', #student unique id\n]\nstatus_columns=[\n    'TP_ST_CONCLUSAO', #high school situation (already over, finishing, ongoing, not on high school) \n]\ngrade_columns_raw = [\n    'NU_NOTA_CN', #grade natural sciencies\n    'NU_NOTA_CH', #grades human sciencies\n    'NU_NOTA_LC', #grades languages and codes\n    'NU_NOTA_MT', #grades math\n    'NU_NOTA_REDACAO', #grades essay\n]\nsocial_economic_columns = [\n    'Q001', #how far did the mother go with her studies\n    'Q002', #how far did the father go with his studies\n    'Q005', #number of people living in the house\n    'Q006', #family income\n]\nschool_columns_raw=[\n    'CO_ESCOLA', #School code\n    'NO_MUNICIPIO_ESC',#School city name\n    'SG_UF_ESC', #School State code\n    'TP_DEPENDENCIA_ADM_ESC', #school dependency(federal gov., state gov., city gov., private)\n]\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/enem-2019/DADOS/MICRODADOS_ENEM_2019.csv', \n                 delimiter=';',\n                 encoding='ISO-8859-1', \n                 usecols=id_columns + status_columns + grade_columns_raw + social_economic_columns + school_columns_raw)\n\ndf = df.rename(columns={\n    'NU_NOTA_CN': 'Natural Sciences',\n    'NU_NOTA_CH': 'Humanities',\n    'NU_NOTA_LC': 'Languages', \n    'NU_NOTA_MT': 'Mathematics',\n    'NU_NOTA_REDACAO': 'Essay', \n    'TP_DEPENDENCIA_ADM_ESC': 'School type'\n})\n\ndf = df.replace({\n    'School type':{\n        1.0: 'Federal',\n        2.0: 'State',\n        3.0: 'City',\n        4.0: 'Private'\n    },\n    'TP_ST_CONCLUSAO':{\n        1.0: 'Graduated',\n        2.0: '3rd year',\n        3.0: '2nd year or before',\n        4.0: 'Not graduated nor ongoing'\n    }\n})\n\ngrade_columns = [\n    'Natural Sciences',\n    'Humanities',\n    'Languages', \n    'Mathematics',\n    'Essay', \n]\n\nschool_columns=[\n    'CO_ESCOLA', #School code\n    'NO_MUNICIPIO_ESC',#School city name\n    'SG_UF_ESC', #School State code\n    'School type', #school dependency(federal gov., state gov., city gov., private)\n]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info(null_counts=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the above, we see that all students have answered social-economic questions.

We concluded that students are highly affected by quality of the school they attend. We show that students on the low income range tends to attend to the worst schools. We also show that the biggest impact on family income improvements happens on the 0-1000 BRL income per person range. The effects on income given the school appears to be limited, but present. It is more present in the very low income range, this time up to about 600BRL per person.  \n\nFederal schools are public schools but, differently from city and state schools, have a performance very close to private schools. Student income distribuition in federal schools are slightly less skewed to low income than state and city schools. We suspect that federal schools can be a role model to other public schools, although further investigation is necessary to see if this is actually doable. \n\nOur analysis shows that students in middle range schools can hope to achieve golden grades on some disciplines. We also notice that high-end schools are able to not only improve its average but also reduce its standard deviation, having a more consistent grading among students. This conclusion needs further investigation. We need to analyse if these schools are able to reproduce this behaviour among the years, or if this fenomena is just derived from the math (after all grades are limited on the top).\n\nThe analysis done here does not include school budget information. We leave for future work to consider the role of school budget on its student performance."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
