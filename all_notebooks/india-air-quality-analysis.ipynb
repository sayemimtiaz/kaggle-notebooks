In autumn and winter months, large scale crop residue burning in agriculture fields – a low cost alternative to mechanical tilling – is a major source of smoke, smog and particulate pollution. India has a low per capita emissions of greenhouse gases but the country as a whole is the third largest after China and the United States.A 2013 study on non-smokers has found that Indians have 30% lower lung function compared to Europeans.\n\nThe Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was passed in 1981 to regulate air pollution and there have been some measurable improvements. However, the 2016 Environmental Performance Index ranked India 141 out of 180 countries.\n![](https://airpollutionindia.weebly.com/uploads/2/0/3/0/20303009/933401085_orig.jpg?372)\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ad9ceb8e588727802de8b30c5e234c01c20a6945"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Pollution is turning the Taj Mahal yellow, despite efforts by the Indian government to control air contamination around the poignant 17th century monument and keep it shimmering white, a parliamentary committee has said. \n\nIn a report to parliament this week, the standing committee on transport, tourism and culture said airborne particles were being deposited on the monument’s white marble, giving it a yellow tinge.\n\nThe monument, in the northern city of Agra about four hours drive south of the capital, was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal.\n\nAuthorities have made various attempts in the past to keep the area around the Taj Mahal pollution free, including setting up an air pollution monitoring station in Agra.\n\nBut the committee said that while air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide gases were generally within permissible limits, “suspended particulate matter” had been recorded at high levels except during the rainy season.\n\nIt suggested a clay pack treatment that is non-corrosive and non-abrasive be carried out to remove deposits on the marble. “The committee recommends that while undertaking any conservation activity at the Taj Mahal, abundant cautions should be taken to retain the original glory of the shimmering white marble used in this.”\n\nAttracting around 20,000 visitors every day, the monument was completed in 1648 after 17 years of construction by 20,000 workers.\n\n![](https://media.indiatimes.in/media/content/2018/Jun/taj_mahal_1528803633.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.plotly as py\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 7)\n\n# Warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data=pd.read_csv('../input/data.csv',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"57c201d7537140c3374c000aacc4896258d620ff"},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"af3e392bf5541fe0510baa74ee7f93f4f58c9de1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"replacements = {\n   'state': {\n      r'Uttaranchal': 'Uttarakhand', \n   }\n}\n\ndata.replace(replacements, regex=True, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ff54d9e2aef0a9c09be6be8bc3618eb40c0cd754"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What is sulfur dioxide?**\n\nSulfur dioxide is a gas.

The observational data are derived from studies outdoors where NO2 is one component of the complex mixture of different pollutants found in ambient air and from studies of NO2 exposure indoors where its sources include unvented combustion appliances. Interpretation of evidence on NO2 exposures outdoors is complicated by the fact that in most urban locations, the nitrogen oxides that yield NO2 are emitted primarily by motor vehicles, making it a strong indicator of vehicle emissions (including other unmeasured pollutants emitted by these sources). NO2 (and other nitrogen oxides) is also a precursor for a number of harmful secondary air pollutants, including nitric acid, the nitrate part of secondary inorganic aerosols and photo oxidants (including ozone). The situation is also complicated by the fact that photochemical reactions take some time (depending on the composition of the atmosphere and meteorological parameters) and air can travel some distance before secondary pollutants are generated. These relationships are shown schematically in Figure 1.\n    Figure 1: Simplified relationship of nitrogen oxides emissions with formation of NO2 and other harmful reaction products including O3 and PM Simplified relationship of nitrogen oxides emissions with formation of NO2 and other harmful reaction products including O3 and PM\n\n    Health risks from nitrogen oxides may potentially result from NO2 itself or its reaction products including O3 and secondary particles. Epidemiological studies of NO2 exposures from outdoor air are limited in being able to separate these effects. Additionally, NO2 concentrations closely follow vehicle emissions in many situations so that NO2 levels are generally a reasonable marker of exposure to traffic related emissions.\n\n    Given these complex relationships, findings of multivariate models that include NO2 and other pollutants need cautious interpretation. While multi-pollutant models have been routinely applied to various forms of observational data, they may mis-specify underlying relationships. Even models that include only NO2 and PM, NO2 and O3, or NO2, PM and O3 do not reflect the interrelationships among these pollutants. Statistical models considering interactions must be based on a strong a priori hypothesis about the nature of these interactions to allow their interpretation. With these constraints in mind, the working group recommended against using regression coefficients for NO2 from regression models for the purpose of quantitative risk assessment.\n\n    Evidence of the health effects of NO2 by itself thus comes largely from toxicological studies and from observational studies on NO2 exposure indoors. The studies of outdoor NO2 may be most useful under the following circumstances:\n\n*         Evidence for NO2 effects assessed at fixed levels of exposure to other pollutants\n*         Evidence for modification of the effect of PM by NO2, possibly indicating a potential consequence of HNO3 vapour and/or PM nitrate.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6b19bbe71fe9ac7c38620373a826b532a0fbc330"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**TOP 10**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d3d0803f8a0d3e3b3739f4eb67a6eb37bd94b276"},"cell_type":"code","source":"data[['no2','state']].groupby([\"state\"]).median().sort_values(by='no2',ascending=False).head(10).plot.bar(color='g')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"96df45ea407589f7ea945d5aa4a6f1741e4d94a0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**BOTTOM 10**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5086726cca517852660e68dacec6bb0bfbb8d23e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"data[['no2','state']].groupby([\"state\"]).median().sort_values(by='no2',ascending=False).tail(10).plot.bar(color='g')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0a309842e5d6a19be886369939452e128570db27"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**RSPM **\n\nRSPM is that fraction of TSPM which is readily inhaled by humans through their respiratory system and in general, considered as particulate matter with their diameter (aerodynamic) less than 2.5 micrometers.
