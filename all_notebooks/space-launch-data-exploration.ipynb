In the Chronology section, we have every space launch for the year, with a list of payloads the launch carried. After a quick analysis of the columns in the dataset and some cleaning on the columns with useful information, we'll create some visualizations and answer some questions.\n\nEach of our rows of our dataset will have a \"payload\" (something that was put in orbit, hopefully, or was lost if the launch failed), in a launch.

Only Iran, South Korea, and New Zealand, since the year 2000. (The Marshall islands launch site belongs to the United States). \n* Many countries are unable to sustain the pace of launches once they get to orbit. However, more research and domain knowledge is needed there: after further research, the 1997 launch from Spain consisted in launching a rocket from an aircraft, that took off from Gran Canaria. There might be some other cases similar to that one.\n* However, the number of different countries placing payloads in orbit increased markedly, specially in these past 15 years. The last few years saw 50 different countries consistently putting at least a satellite in orbit.\n\nWhat would we like to find out next? There are many interesting questions that can answer with this data, if we properly handle the columns that were disregarded. Furthermore, after our initial dive, some other questions arise:\n\n* What's the use of the satellites currently in space? (military, techonology)\n* What's the average mass of the payloads in orbit? Satellites supposedly got smaller these last few years.\n* What about private companies? Can we tell when they started launching into space?\n* What's the most reliable launch vehicle?\n* It would be nice to visualize some of this information in a map.\n* Do we have any information about humans in space in our data?\n* What about the launch vehicles employed?
