With that campaign, Burundi is working to provide access to screening for those people that could not in the past and they feel that now is the time that they can work together on this problem.\n\nThere were enough supplies, testing kits and masks, and that all the necessary precautions were being taken.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Burundi reported 191 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and one death, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But healthcare workers and experts have raised concerns about its spread in the East African nation of 11 million people. \n'\nThe Previous president Nkurunziza, died last month of a heart attack, had been criticised for not taking the pandemic seriously.\n\nHe expressed the belief that divine protection would largely suffice for protection against COVID-19, allowed large campaign rallies ahead of the presidential election in May, refused to enforce strict physical distancing measures and kicked out the World Health Organization's (WHO) country director for criticising the government's response to the disease.\n\nLast week, Ndayishimiye surprised many when he declared COVID-19 as \"the worst enemy of Burundi\" and announced preventive measures against the disease including mass screening wherever they are cases and reducing the price of soap and water.\n\nThe health minister issued stronger guidelines, saying that people visiting patients at hospitals must \"be supplied with masks and health personnel be equipped with protective masks\". He also said taxi drivers should clean seats and that passengers should wear masks.\n\nLast month, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Burundi's government of failing to communicate fact-based information about the pandemic and preventing doctors and nurses from responding adequately.\n\nSeveral healthcare workers spoke anonymously to the group, alleging that the National Institute for Public Health is refusing to conduct virus tests or properly inform the public on the extent of infections.\n\nThey also alleged that a national hotline for COVID-19 often goes unanswered, and that supervisors tell them to keep quiet about shortages of medical equipment.\n https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/burundi-coronavirus-policy-mass-testing-bujumbura-city-200707072204472.html","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTyhcSsKzJraC6p1lHT5PBiukwZtkn-PIjMsA&usqp=CAU)theglobalherald.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![]()","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://storage.googleapis.com/hipstamp/p/77722cd06465df9ebc32e16715df138c.jpg)https://www.hipstamp.com/listing/burundi-scott-b9-13-anti-tb-set-1965-mh/2880014","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Bujumbura, Burundi (PANA) - Some 6,500 cases of tuberculosis are recorded and treated annually in Burundi, health workers said on Monday in Bujumbura during the observance of World Tuberculosis Control Day.\n\nThe figure, however, may not be a real picture of the situation in the country, as many TB patients neglect to get medical attention. A more realistic figure should be more than 15,000 patients per year. In the rural areas the situation is relatively unknown.\n\nIn addition, efforts to curb the disease were today hampered by the rise in Burundi of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. TB has thus become the main opportunistic disease related to HIV/AIDS in the country.\n\nAccording to the doctor, studies showed that the number of patients suffering both from HIV/AIDS and TB is increasing. The most apparent symptoms of tuberculosis are, among others, gradual coughing, loss of weight, physical weakness and increased body temperature.\n\nAn education campaign for the population to make themselves available for treatment in time at hospital rather than at the local traditional doctors.

reduce mortality and morbidity, while improving prevention, early detection and the quality of care for people in Burundi.\n\nThe project targets tubercular and diabetic patients in six Burundi hospitals, including the reference healthcare centres in the provinces of Bujumbura, Bujumbura Mairie, Kayanza, Ngozi, Bururi and Muramvya.\n\nThe project partner, 'Alliance Burundaise Pour la Lutte

Non-Transmissible Diseases (PNILCMNT) and The Integrated National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Programme (PNILT). \n\nIn the preparation phase, a project coordination group for development of guidelines and a training programme will be established. Training includes a 5-day training of 60 HCPs in TB and diabetes management, using the Training of Trainers (ToTs) model. Referral networks will be established.\n\nA free universal screening will be organised. TB patients will be screened for diabetes and diabetes patients screened for TB through sputum tests. Referral for follow-up will be made to already established diabetes centres.\n\nPatients trained via the TB programme will be informed about diabetes co-morbidity and be provided with guidelines, patient counselling and follow-up.
