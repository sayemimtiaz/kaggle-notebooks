Their ideas were variations around the topic of exponential smoothing: weighted averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially as the observations get older. A huge practical advantage of those methods that one only needs the previous smoothed value and current time series value to create a forecast for the next step - an important aspect in an era when a computer had less memory than a cheapest smartphone available in the market today.\n\nAs computing power became more available, exponential smoothing methods started fading into the \"historical\" section of statistics guide - until people started realizing that with the latency requirements of trading or e-commerce, speed is more important that additional 5pct improvement in error and one-step forecasts started making a comeback. \n\nBelow, I present the most popular exponential smoothing methods - along with some practical tips and suggestions.\n\n* [Exponential smoothing ](#section-one)\n* [Popular methods](#section-two)\n* [Anomaly detection](#section-three)\n* [Example pipeline](#section-four)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nimport itertools\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom random import gauss\nfrom pandas.plotting import autocorrelation_plot\nfrom statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf\nfrom random import random\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import SimpleExpSmoothing, ExponentialSmoothing, Holt\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight') \n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category= FutureWarning)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T22:38:11.826943Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T22:38:11.827722Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T22:38:12.504575Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T22:38:11.827562Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T22:38:12.503501Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# general settings\nclass CFG:\n    data_folder = '../input/tsdata-1/'\n    img_dim1 = 20\n    img_dim2 = 10\n        \n# adjust the parameters for displayed figures    \nplt.rcParams.update({'figure.figsize': (CFG.img_dim1,CFG.img_dim2)})    ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T22:38:12.506198Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T22:38:12.506558Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T22:38:12.513249Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T22:38:12.506521Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T22:38:12.512157Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-one\"></a>\n# Exponential smoothing ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As mentioned above, exponential moving average (EMA) assigns exponentially decreasing weights over time.

We have learnt to predict intercept with our previous methods; now, we will apply the same exponential smoothing to the trend by assuming that the future direction of the time series changes depends on the previous weighted changes.  Double exponential smoothing, a.k.a. the Holt method is defined by the relationship:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS_t = \\alpha X_t + (1 - \\alpha) (S_{t-1} + b_{t-1})\\\\\nb_t = \\beta (S_t - S_{t-1}) + (1- \\beta) b_{t-1}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $S_1 = X_1$, $\\quad b_1 = X_1 - X_0$ and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in (0,1)$\n\nThe first equation describes the intercept, which depends on the current value of the series. The second term is now split into previous values of the level and of the trend. The second function describes the trend, which depends on the level changes at the current step and on the previous value of the trend. Complete prediction is composed of the sum of level and trend and the difference with simple exponential smoothing is that we need a second parameter to smooth the trend - as before, those can be set based on expert judgement or estimated (jointly) from the data. \n\nThe forecast $h$ steps ahead is defined by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\hat{X}_{t+h} = S_t + h b_t\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe forecast function is no longer flat but trending: $h$-step-ahead forecast is equal to the last estimated level plus $h$ times the last estimated trend value.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's compare the performance of the two methods on the passenger dataset:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nalpha = 0.5\ndf = pd.read_csv(CFG.data_folder + 'passengers.csv', usecols = ['passengers'])\ndf.plot.line()\nfit1 = SimpleExpSmoothing(df).fit(smoothing_level= alpha,optimized=False)\nfcast1 = fit1.forecast(12).rename(r'$\\alpha=0.5$')\nfcast1.plot(marker='o', color='red', legend=True)\nfit1.fittedvalues.plot(  color='red')\nplt.show()\n\ndf.plot.line()\n\nfit1 = Holt(df).fit(smoothing_level=0.5, smoothing_slope=0.5, optimized=False)\nfcast1 = fit1.forecast(12).rename(\"Holt's linear trend\")\nfit1.fittedvalues.plot(color='red')\nfcast1.plot(color='red', legend=True)\n\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T22:38:14.143664Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T22:38:14.144062Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T22:38:14.718794Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T22:38:14.144022Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T22:38:14.717739Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It seems like we are moving in the right direction - the forecast going forward is not constant, but follows a trend.

A natural extension is to introduce a smoothed seasonal component: triple exponential smoothing, a.k.a.

For each observation in the season, there is a separate component; for example, if the length of the season is 7 days (a weekly seasonality), we will have 7 seasonal components, one for each day of the week.

By considering variations in the combinations of the trend and seasonal components, nine exponential smoothing methods are possible: each method is labelled by a pair of letters (T,S) defining the type of ‘Trend’ and ‘Seasonal’ components. For example, (A,M) is the method with an additive trend and multiplicative seasonality; (Ad ,N) is the method with damped trend and no seasonality; and so on.\n\n![expo_smoo_table.png](attachment:e56a2ba9-f663-45fe-99ba-5b088b087630.png)\n\nSome of these methods we have already seen using other names:\n* (N,N) is simple exponential smoothing\n* (A,N) is

The basic idea is that after suitable normalization, most kinds of data starts behaving like a Gaussian distribution (look up Central Limit Theorem if you would like to understand why) - which implies we only need mean and standard deviation to assess if a given observation is an outlier. \n\nThe calculation of the Z-score for each individual point in the series proceeds in the following manner:\n* select a window size $w$\n* calculate rolling mean / standard deviation with window $w$\n* demean and normalize by sd:\n\\begin{equation}\nZ_t = \\left|\\frac{X_t - \\bar{X}_m}{\\sigma_m} \\right|\n\\end{equation}\n\n* Z-score measures number of sd away from mean $\\implies$ values above 3 indicate extremely unlikely realization","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load \nseries = pd.read_csv(CFG.data_folder + 'ambient_temperature_system_failure.csv')\nseries['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(series['timestamp'])\n\n# plot \nseries['value'].plot()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.048984Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.049293Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.284729Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.049263Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.283957Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# pick a window size \nwindow_size = 25\n\n# calculate rolling mean and standard deviation\nxroll = series['value'].rolling(window_size)\nseries['mean_roll'] = xroll.mean()\nseries['sd_roll'] = xroll.std()\n\n# calculate the Z-score\nseries['zscore'] = np.abs( (series['value'] - series['mean_roll']) / series['sd_roll'])\nseries['zscore'].plot()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.285796Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.286176Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.551528Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.286146Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.55045Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# check which observations are out of range\nseries.loc[series['zscore'] > 3][['timestamp', 'value']]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.553955Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.554349Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.572217Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.554314Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T22:38:15.571047Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Putting it all together\n\nNow that we have all the pieces prepared, we can combine them to build a predictive model.

This confirms the intuition that there are aspects of the data generating process that are not adequately captured by our three prameter model - but for something that simple, you can make a solid case it is acceptable. \n\nIn the next module, we will introduce the ARIMA family - the workhorses of applied time series for quite a few decades, and still used in many applications. This will allow us to revisit this example and see if a more sophisticated model can do a better job. Stay tuned!","metadata":{}}]}
