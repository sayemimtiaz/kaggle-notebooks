{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\n\nThis notebook deals with models for predicting whether ceramic glazes will be glossy or matte when fired, using the [Glazy](https://glazy.org/) glaze database. The primary target audience is potters with some understanding of glaze calculation. Although familiarity with standard data science techniques would be helpful in understanding the construction of the models, this is not required to understand the predictions. Regardless of your background, please feel free to ask questions or make suggestions.\n\nSome of the factors that can affect whether or not a glaze will be glossy are the chemical composition, the firing profile (particularly the cooling phase), the particle size of the ingredients, the clay-body to which the glaze was applied, and whether the person who measured the glaze batch was paying attention or not. The data in the Glazy library contains fields for the chemical composition, expressed in terms of oxides, and an upper and lower bound for the firing [cone](https://wiki.glazy.org/t/measuring-heatwork-temperature-with-orton-cones/509), but there are no fields for the other factors. Can this limited information be used to predict whether a glaze will be matte or glossy?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first part of this notebook involves data preparation.

This creates a problem when deciding which model has the best predictive ability, for the following reason. A model's predictive ability is determined by training it on a subset of the data (the 'training set'), and then measuring the accuracy of its predictions on data that it was not trained on (the 'validation set'). If there is a substantial overlap between the training and validation sets, models which simply memorise the training set will do well on the validation set, even if they perform poorly on data not in the training set. To mitigate this, we group the data into clusters of similar recipes, and ensure that recipes in the same cluster don't occur in both the training and validation sets. \n\nA related problem is that recipes which have many duplicates have a disproportionate effect on the training and evaluation of models. To counteract this, we weight each recipe in a cluster by 1/n, where n is the number of recipes in the cluster. This means that no matter how many times a recipe is duplicated, the combined weight of all the duplicates is still 1.\n\nWe use the [K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm to cluster the recipes, and select the best number of clusters by maximising the average [silhouette score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering%29)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ncluster_candidates0 = labelled_data[ox_umf] #[~data.surface_type.isnull()][ox_umf]\n# The clustering will be done in two stages.

This is a type of [boosting](https://towardsdatascience.com/boosting-algorithms-explained-d38f56ef3f30) algorithm, which falls under the umbrella of [supervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) methods. Briefly, the goal in supervised machine learning is to produce a function that can correctly predict an outcome based on some input data. In our case, we want to produce a function that predicts either 'glossy' or 'matte', given the UMF data and firing range of the glaze. This function is constructed (or 'learnt') from a list of inputs together with the corresponding list of outcomes. Once the function has been constructed, you can feed it any input data of the appropriate form, and it will produce an outcome, or prediction.\n\nTo determine how well it performs, we'll first train it on a subset of the data, then evaluate its predictions on the remaining data. These two subsets are called the *training* and *validation* subsets. Different choices of training / validation splits may lead to different results, so we do this multiple times, in a process called [cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html). This gives multiple evaluations, which we'll summarise by reporting the mean (average) and standard deviation.\n\nMachine learning algorithms usually depend on a number of parameters (called *hyper*parameters in this context), and XGBoost is no exception. Models with hyperparameters can be thought of as a family of algorithms, indexed by the hyperparameters. Instead of picking one such algorithm by using a fixed choice of hyperparameters, during the training step we'll try multiple hyperparameters, and use cross-validation on the training set to select the ones with the highest average cross-validation score. The hyperparameters we try are determined using [Bayesian optimisation](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-conceptual-explanation-of-bayesian-model-based-hyperparameter-optimization-for-machine-learning-b8172278050f).\n\nThere are a number of ways of measuring the predictive ability of an algorithm that predicts one of two outcomes (a *binary classifier*). The most intuitive is probably the accuracy (proportion of correct predictions), but we'll use something called the [Matthews Correlation Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient) (MCC), which has better properties than the accuracy. The key thing to know about the MCC is that it takes values in the interval from -1 to 1, with 1 being all predictions correct, -1 being all predictions incorrect, and 0 the expected value if predictions are made randomly."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"seeds = np.arange(0,200)\n\nstrat_wt_kfold = StratifiedWeightedGroupKFold(n_splits=5, \n                                              n_repeats=3, \n                                              shuffle=True, \n                                              random_states=seeds,\n                                              weights=weights)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# https://medium.com/vantageai/bringing-back-the-time-spent-on-hyperparameter-tuning-with-bayesian-optimisation-2e21a3198afb\n\n# helper function\ndef convert_param_types(param_dist, params):\n    return {k: eval(param_dist[k].name)(v) for k, v in params.items()}\n\n#from sklearn.utils.validation import check_X_y, check_array, check_is_fitted\n\nclass BOestimator(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):\n    def __init__(self, model_class=LogisticRegression, param_space={}, fixed_params={}, num_eval=20, groups=None, scorer=None):\n        self.model_class = model_class\n        self.param_space = param_space\n        self.fixed_params = fixed_params\n        self.num_eval = num_eval\n        self.groups=groups\n        self.scorer = scorer\n\n    def fit(self, X, y=None, sample_weight=None, cv=5, seed=None):\n        \n        if type(cv) is int:\n            pass\n        else:\n            try:\n                cv.weights = sample_weights\n            except:\n                pass\n            cv=cv.split(X, y, groups=self.groups[X.index])   #
