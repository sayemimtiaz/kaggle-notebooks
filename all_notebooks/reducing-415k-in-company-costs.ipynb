Granted not all attritions are bad, some employees are just disrupting, but in general maintining the maximum number of employees as possible is a sound strategy, as described [here](https://inventiv.io/what-is-the-cost-of-replacing-an-employee/), [here](https://www.employeeconnect.com/blog/flight-risk-signals-what-makes-employees-leave/) and [here](http://analytics-magazine.org/predictive-analytics-the-privacy-pickle-hewlett-packards-prediction-of-employee-behavior/)\n\nWith this context in mind we'll try to create a model to predict who's about to leave the company so we could report it to HR and they can decid to do something about it\n\n# Table Of Contents\n 1.

Probably a young, single person who puts in alot of overtime, they may leave because they're the most attractive persons for other companies to employ them, or it might be because they're feeling unappreciated.\n\n## But how does the effect of age/income evolve as these variables increase?\n\nIt's an interesting thing to find out.
