{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Overview**\n\nThis kernel provides a general review and discussion of the debate surrounding Big Data and well-being. We ask four main questions: Is Big Data very new or very old? How well can we now predict individual and aggregate well-being with Big Data, and to what extent do\nnovel measurement tools complement surveybased measures? Is Big Data responsible for the rising interest in well-being or a threat to it?<br>\nWhat are the economic and societal consequences of Big Data, and is there a point to government regulation of ownership, access, and consent?<br>\n\nAcademic articles and books on these developments are now plentiful. The term used to describe this data explosion and its\nBig Brother type uses, “Big Data”, was cited 40,000 times in 2017 in Google Scholar, about as often as “happiness”! This data explosion was accompanied by the rise of statistical techniques coming from the field of computer science, in particular machine learning. The later provided methods to analyse and exploit these large datasets for prediction purposes, justifying the accumulation of increasingly large and detailed data.The term Big Data in this chapter will refer to large datasets that contain multiple observations\nof individuals.4 Of particular interest is the data gathered on individuals without their “considered consent”. This will include all forms of data that one could gather, if determined, about others without their knowledge, such as visual information\nand basic demographic and behavioural characteristics. Other examples are Twitter, public Facebook posts, the luminescence of\nhomes, property, etc.Is this information used to say something about well-being, ie Life Satisfaction? How could it be used to affect well-being? And how should it be used? These question concerning Big Data and Well-being - where are we, where could we go, and where should we go - will be explored in this chapter.<br>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nimport os\n!ls ../input/\n\nImage(\"../input/imageshappiness1/BigData.png\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns  \n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data2015=pd.read_csv('../input/world-happiness/2015.csv')\n#data2016=pd.read_csv('../input/2016.csv')\n#data2017=pd.read_csv('../input/2017.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score(like Family, Generosity, etc.) describe?**\n\nThe following columns: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country.

The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.<br>\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data2015.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\" 2015 Correlation of data \")\ndata2015.corr() \n\n#print(\" 2016 Correlation of data \")\n#print( data2016.corr() )\n\n#print(\" 2017 Correlation of data \")\n#print( data2017.corr() )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(18, 18))\nsns.heatmap(data2015.corr(), annot=True, linewidths=.5, fmt= '.1f',ax=ax)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In short, adolescents who spend more time on electronic devices are less happy, and adolescents who spend more time on most other activities are happier.
