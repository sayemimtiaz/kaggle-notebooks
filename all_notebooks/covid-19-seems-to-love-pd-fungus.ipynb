is spreading at an alarming rate, in bats in many regions of the world.\n- WNS affects blood circulation, thermoregulation, water balance, and gas exchange in bats.\n- WNS causes bats to arouse more often during hibernation, burn up fat reserves, and later starve to death.\n- WNS is caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) fungus, growing on and in the skin of bats mainly during winter
