They compared BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 for middle-high and high-income countries. They found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies.\n\nThe difference cannot be accounted for by differences in disease onset, adoption of early social distancing policies, state of health services, nor income level. Reduced mortality suggests BCG vaccination could be a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v2"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#BCG Vaccination Protects against Experimental Viral Infection in Humans through the Induction of Cytokines Associated with Trained #Immunity\n\n\nAuthors: Rob J.W.Arts, Simone J.C.F.M.Moorlag, BorisNovakovic, YangLi Shuang-YinWang, MarijeOosting, VinodKumar, Ramnik J.Xavier, CiscaWijmenga, Leo A.B.Joosten1Chantal B.E.M.Reusken, Christine S.Benn, PeterAaby, Marion P.Koopmans, Hendrik G.Stunnenberg, Reinoutvan Crevel, Mihai G.Netea. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2017.12.010\n\n\n\nBCG vaccination of humans induces genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming in monocytes.\n\n\nBCG-induced changes correlate with protection against experimental virus infection.\n\n\nViremia reduction correlates with IL-1β upregulation, indicative of trained immunity.\n\n\nSNPs in IL1B affect the induction of trained immunity by BCG.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1931312817305462-fx1.jpg)https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312817305462"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Although COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in the elderly population,recent  BCG vaccination in children might play a role in reducing mortality by decreasing the transmission of the disease to the vulnerable population. Asymptomatic children in Germany,\nwhere BCG is not applied to children since 1998, had viral loads that were as high as adults, which suggests that unvaccinated children may be as infectious as adults. A reduction of the viral load in children might act as a plausible mechanism by which BCG vaccination in children could reduce infections and mortality in a country.\n\nA recent study determined that BCG vaccination in childhood did not reduce COVID-19 infection in young adults, a population with reduced mortality due to COVID-19. Patients with bladder cancer that have been treated with multiple doses of BCG constitute a population that is worth studying for possible protective effects against COVID-19.\n\nIf BCG were protective for COVID-19, why did COVID-19 spread in China despite having an universal BCG policy since the 1950s?\n\nThere is still not proof that BCG inoculation at old age would boost defenses in elderly humans against COVID-19, but it seems to do so in Guinea pigs against M. tuberculosis.\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v2.full.pdf"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from colorama import Fore, Style\n\nnRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\n# ham_lyrics.csv has 3634 rows in reality, but we are only loading/previewing the first 1000 rows\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/task_2-BCG_strain_per_country-8Nov2020.csv', delimiter=',', nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'task_2-BCG_strain_per_country-8Nov2020.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\nprint(Fore.RED + 'Data shape: ',Style.RESET_ALL,df.shape)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"BCG vaccination has been shown to produce broad protection against viral infections and sepsis,raising the possibility that the protective effect of BCG may not be directly related to actions on COVID-19 but associated co-occurring infections or sepsis.\n\nThe authors also found that BCG vaccination correlated with a reduction in the number of COVID-19 reported infections in a country suggesting that BCG might confer some protection specifically against COVID-19.
