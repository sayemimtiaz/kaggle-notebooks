Experimenting with augmentations is a great way to find out just how far your data can go!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The End #\n\nThat's all for **Computer Vision** on Kaggle Learn! We hope you've enjoyed your time with us. The ideas you've learned in this course have prepared you for many other topics in deep learning; convolutional networks are used not only with images, but also with text, audio, and video. What are you interested in?\n\n- Instead of classifying images, maybe you'd like to create some new ones? **generative adversarial networks** (GANs) can learn how to do that. Check out the notebooks and discussion in the [Generative Dog Images](https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images/) competition to learn more.\n- If you want to teach a network to learn *where* in an image something is, you might want to learn more about **image segmentation**. The [SIIM-ACR](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/) competition challenged Kagglers to locate a lung condition called *pneumothorax* in medical scans. The convolutional U-Net model was used successfully there.\n- The [Flickr Image](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset) dataset has a number of notebooks that will show you how to make a network that can automatically generate descriptions of an image.\n- [Celeb Faces Attributes (Celeb A)](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset/kernels) is a large dataset of celebrity faces with annotated descriptions. There are lots of interesting projects you could try with it.\n\nHave fun learning!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
