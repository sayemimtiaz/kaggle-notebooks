That swab goes into a tube and is sent to a lab. Some large hospitals have on-site molecular test labs, but most samples are sent to outside laboratories for processing. More on that later.\n\nThat transit time usually runs about 24 hours, but it could be longer, depending on how far the hospital is from the processing laboratory.\n\nOnce at the lab, the specimen is processed, which means lab workers extract the virus's RNA, the molecule that helps regulate genes.\n\n\"That step of cleaning — the RNA extraction step — is one limiting factor,\" says Cathie Klapperich, vice chair of the department of biomedical engineering at Boston University. \"Only the very biggest labs have automated ways of extracting RNA from a sample and doing it quickly.\"\n\nAfter the RNA is extracted, technicians also must carefully mix special chemicals with each sample and run those combinations in a machine for analysis, a process called polymerase chain reaction, which can detect whether the sample is positive or negative for COVID.\n\n\"Typically, a PCR test takes six hours from start to finish to complete,\" says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\n\nSome labs have larger staffs and more machines, so they can process more tests at a time than others. But even for those labs, as demand grows, so does the backlog.\n\nCapacity is expanding, but not fast enough\nInitially, only a few public health labs and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention processed COVID-19 tests. Problems with the first CDC test kits also led to delays.\n\nNow the CDC has a better kit, and 94 public health labs across the country do COVID-19 testing, says Wroblewski.\nBut those labs can't possibly do all that's needed. In normal times, their main function is regular public health surveillance — detecting more common threats such as outbreaks of measles or monitoring seasonal influenza — \"but not to do diagnostic testing of the magnitude that is required in this response,\" she says.\n\n\"A chief medical officer on the East Coast said that, up until two days ago, on average, it was taking 72 hours to get results,\" says Susan Van Meter, executive director of AdvaMedDx, a division of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a device and diagnostics industry trade group. \"That will get better as our member companies come on the market.\"\n\nEven so, supply is not keeping up with demand, Roche CEO Severin Schwan told CNBC on Monday. Roche won the first approval from the FDA for a test kit under emergency rules, and it has delivered more than 400,000 kits so far.\n\"Demand continues to be much higher than supply,\" Schwan told CNBC. \"So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing, but the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible.\"\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/28/822869504/why-it-takes-so-long-to-get-most-covid-19-test-results\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/uncover/nextstrain/covid-19-genetic-phylogeny.csv\")\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTjPpIRHE28xGGaN-8_FwZqMTEFmT5hml7zStJa5AuwPmfGqa39&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"visiongain.com Global Biomarkers Market Forecast 2017-2027\n\nThe global biomarkers market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.1% in the first half of the forecast period.

Large commercial labs can do a lot. LabCorp, for example, says it is processing 20,000 tests a day — and hopes to do more soon.

The FDA in recent days has approved tests from two companies that promise results in 45 minutes or less, but those likely will be available only in hospitals that have special equipment to run them. One of those companies, Cepheid of Sunnyvale, Calif., says about 5,000 U.S. hospitals already have the equipment needed to process these tests. Both firms say they will ship to the hospitals soon but have given few specifics on quantity or timing.\n\nBut many public health officials say primary care doctors and clinics need a truly rapid test they can use in their offices — one like the tests already in use for influenza or strep throat.\n\nA number of companies are moving in that direction. Late Friday, for instance, Abbott Laboratories announced that the FDA has given emergency use authorization for the company's rapid, point-of-care test, which can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13.\n\nThe tests are processed on a small device already installed in thousands of medical offices, ERs, urgent care clinics and other settings. Abbott said it will begin next week to make 50,000 tests available per day.\n\n\"That's going to make a meaningful difference,\" says Van Meter at AdvaMedDx, who believes the rapid tests are a key additional piece in the continuum of available testing.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential `BIOMARKER` that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28 cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers. Serum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). Serum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea, CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild COVID-19.

Consults, echocardiograms, CT, or invasive angiograms and other further investigation of abnormal cardiac biomarkers run the risk of exposing healthcare providers and other patients,\" the article's author, James L. Januzzi Jr, MD, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology.\n\n\"For all those reasons, clinicians should strongly consider reserving measurement of troponin and natriuretic peptide testing for circumstances in which they would add meaningfully to the clinical picture, and where they would significantly alter the management of patients with the virus.\"\nThe assays include those for cardiac troponin (cTn) and either brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP). Elevations in cTn by high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTn) are even more likely in patients with COVID-19, the article cautions.\n\nGiven the novelty of coronavirus as a public health threat, there are as yet few publications on the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. However, elevations in the biomarkers are common in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in general, and are \"associated with an unfavorable course,\" the article notes.\n\"While neither alone is specific for acute MI or heart failure,\" Januzzi said, \"both biomarkers are prognostic, supporting the contention they are a measure of disease severity, regardless of their lack of a link to MI or heart failure.\"\nIn patients with COVID-19, therefore, \"clinicians are advised to only measure troponin or natriuretic peptides if the diagnosis of acute MI or heart failure are being considered on clinical grounds,\" the article states.\nMoreover, \"an abnormal troponin or natriuretic peptide result should not be considered evidence for an acute MI or heart failure without corroborating evidence.\"\n\nAmerican College of Cardiology.

These are either substance, molecule or a physical event that indicate the existence of cancerous cells in the body. These molecules are generally found in tissues, urine, serum, blood, and other body fluids that indicate any abnormal process or a disease.\n\nCancer biomarkers are traceable substances that can be used as an indicator of biological state of tumor and thus it can be used to analyze diagnostic and prognostic stages of cancer. The prevention of cancer by diagnosing and analyzing various cancer biomarkers using different diagnostic techniques is a profound approach for obtaining rapid results for treatment. These biomarkers are used as risk indicators for various cancer types such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer among others. Some of the key biomarkers that are widely used include CEA, SCC, NSE Cyfra 21-1 and TPA (lung cancer), PSA (prostate cancer) and CA15-3, EGF R, BRCA 1/2 and Cytokeratin 14 (breast cancer).https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/cancer-biomarkers-market"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes from Thor the God of Thunder"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.style.use('dark_background')\nfor col in df1[num].drop(['LiverTumorSamples GSM2359853_CoV2'],axis=1):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\n    plt.plot(df1[col].value_counts(),color='Orange')\n    plt.xlabel(col)\n    plt.ylabel('LiverTumorSamples GSM2359851_CoV1')\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cnt_srs = df1['LiverTumorSamples GSM2359853_CoV2'].value_counts().head()\ntrace = go.Bar(\n    y=cnt_srs.index[::-1],\n    x=cnt_srs.values[::-1],\n    orientation = 'h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color=cnt_srs.values[::-1],\n        colorscale = 'Reds',\n        reversescale = True\n    ),\n)\n\nlayout = dict(\n    title='LiverTumorSamples GSM2359853_CoV2',\n    )\ndata = [trace]\nfig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)\npy.iplot(fig, filename=\"LiverTumorSamples GSM2359853_CoV2\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR2AHd6g77eXzQ3xIL02Mn_YLv4CqhKlAq9sYJAI5bVro25gFKM&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"grandviewresearch.com"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cnt_srs = df1['LiverTumorSamples GSM2359916_inactiveHeatCoV2'].value_counts().head()\ntrace = go.Bar(\n    y=cnt_srs.index[::-1],\n    x=cnt_srs.values[::-1],\n    orientation = 'h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color=cnt_srs.values[::-1],\n        colorscale = 'Greens',\n        reversescale = True\n    ),\n)\n\nlayout = dict(\n    title='LiverTumorSamples GSM2359916_inactiveHeatCoV2',\n    )\ndata = [trace]\nfig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)\npy.iplot(fig, filename=\"LiverTumorSamples GSM2359916_inactiveHeatCoV2\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcReKpCSfOrQTDl4rpO0Z_ivQgVbl74zBXQnk-q2wmGZhBou4qhy&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"aandt.co.jp"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#In Memoriam: Healthcare Workers Who Have Died of COVID-19"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata  @mpwolke"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
