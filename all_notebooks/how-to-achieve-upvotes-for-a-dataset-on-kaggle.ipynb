Not absolutly clear how these two variables influence each other.\n\n<a id=\"section-seven\"></a>\n### 7. Hyped topics and the upvotes\n\nBy looking at the datasets search page, sometimes it seems that the most upvoted datasets on Kaggle are usually on hyped/hot topics (COVID19 etc).

So probably in order to obtain the upvotes, the dataset can be of any theme as long as it is good in terms of quality and usability.\n\n<a id=\"section-eight\"></a>\n### Conclusion\n\n- There is a strong correlation between the number of upvotes and the number of kernels/downloads/views associated with that dataset. However, the way they affect each other isn't 100% clear\n \n- The average number of upvotes for datasets with at least 1 tag is higher than the average number of upvotes for datasets without tags. Also the more tags - the higher the average upvotes number. \n \n- The average number of upvotes for datasets with a specified license type is higher than the average number of upvotes for datasets without the license. \n\n- The average number of upvotes for datasets with both description and subtitle is higher than the average number of upvotes for datasets without any of these. \n\n- There is no correlation between the number of upvotes and the number of dataset updates\n \n- There is no direct correlation between the number of days the dataset stays on Kaggle and the upvotes. However, the average number of upvotes for older datasets is higher (most likely because there were too many datasets with low upvotes uploaded recently)\n \n- The average number of upvotes for datasets that were uploaded by the authors with higher performance tiers is higher than the authors with lower tiers\n\n- Popular topics are quite well distributed across the most upvoted datasets in the last 3 years\n\nIt is really difficult to create a popular dataset, that is noticed and upvoted by Kagglers. Nearly 60% of uploaded datasets aren't getting any upvotes and only 8% of datasets achieve more than 10 upvotes.\n\nViews, kernels, and downloads are correlated to upvotes. So potentially it's a good idea to add a few kernels to your dataset and try to attract some views to it.\n\nIn terms of dataset usability, it is strongly advised to add tags, license type, description, and subtitles for more upvotes.\n\nFrequently updating your dataset isn't really helpful in terms of upvotes. Although, if the dataset is of good quality - it might gain some additional upvotes with time. \n\nProbably it doesn't really matter if the dataset topic is currently on hype or not. More important is the quality and usability of a dataset and this tends to be more valued on Kaggle. "}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
