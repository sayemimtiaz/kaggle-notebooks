Load the data from the CSV files\n2. Explore each dataset - columns, counts, basic stats\n3. Understand the domain context and explore underlying patterns in the data\n4. Explore the data and try to answer questions like -\n\n    • What is the mean value of daily yield?\n    \n    • What is the total irradiation per day?\n    \n    • What is the max ambient and module temperature?\n    \n    • How many inverters are there for each plant?\n    \n    • What is the maximum/minimum amount of DC/AC Power generated in a time interval/day?\n    \n    • Which inverter (source_key) has produced maximum DC/AC power?\n    \n    • Rank the inverters based on the DC/AC power they produce\n    \n    • Is there any missing data?\n    \nYou might have to pre-process the data to allow for some of the analysis (hint: date and time)\n\n# **Visualization and Further Exploration -**\n\nTask Details\n\n1. Create a fresh notebook with visualizations that help understand the data and underlying patterns.\nStart with graphs that explain the patterns for attributes independent of other variables. These will usually be tracked as changes of attributes against DATETIME, DATE, or TIME. Examples - how is DC or AC Power changing as time goes by? how is irradiation changing as time goes by? how are ambient and module temperature changing as time goes by? how does yield change as time goes by? Explore plotting variables against different granularities of DATETIME and which is the best option for each variable.\n\n2. Plot two variables against each other to discover degree of correlation between them. Try out different variable pairs - ambient and module temperature, DC and AC Power, Irradiation and module/ambient temperature, irradiation and DC/AC Power. Can you find different ways of visualizing the above relationships?\n\nAs always, you will be evaluated how thorough is your work. There are extra marks for creativity on this one - the more interesting and varied your graphs the more points you get.\n\n# **Competition -**\n\nTask Details\n\nYou will be evaluated on the following criteria -\n\n1. Thoroughness of your data analysis\n2. Quality of data visualization\n3. Understanding of tech as well as domain\n4. Are you providing actionable insights?\n5. Softer aspects - flow of the storyline, confidence in your outcomes, ability to justify your analysis and answer questions\n\n# **Tell A Story -**\n\nTask Details\n\nThis is probably the most important skill for a Data Scientist - the ability to communicate the story. You have worked hard over the last two tasks for understand the data and discover patterns and relationships. It is time to put all that to good use.\n\nFind one story worth telling based on all your work. Create a notebook that walks the viewer through the entire story, one step at a time.\n\nA few tips -\n\n• Pick an interesting conclusion that you want to arrive at\n\n• Build a logical progression from loading and pre-processing data to showing minor observations along the way and eventually building up to the grand finale\n\n• Substantiate your argument with data along the way (you are a data scientist not just a story teller :))\n\n• Every good story has some key elements - characters, setting, plot, complication and solution, try to build as many of them as you can.\n\n• Deliver for the aha moment! Give the user an insight that can potentially impact the business. If the viewer doesn't get that then they won't appreciate your effort.\n\nEvaluation\n\nYou will be graded on -\n\n• how engaging is your story?\n\n• how well did you substantiate it with data?\n\n• how interesting was the conclusion/key insight?\n\n• how good were your visualizations?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Task the 1st: Descriptive Analytics**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.

An interesting thing of note, though it appears to be minor in the visualizations, is the correlation between ambient temperature and module temperature. Each feature appears to increase at a fairly positive rate to each other up to a certain point, then we see the module temperature begin to decrease marginally as ambient temperature continues to increase. As I mentioned, this is just slight and could be nothing, but it could also be indicitive of a possible temperature regulation system in place that keeps the module from rising above a certain level, or perhaps the material used to create the modules (the solar panels). A final thought on this, taking into consideration how heat and energy work, this could possibly also be caused by the modules shifting that energy from the sun down stream to the inverter, and then to further energy storage or management systems. The ambient temperature itself is not in a controlled environment and thus will continue to gain heat as the amount of energy obtained from the sun increases. The module temperature shifts that energy away, in a sense regulating its moment-to-moment temperature."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import datetime\n# Let's take a look at some of the non-numeric data compared to the numeric data now\n# Start by converting the date and time column to datetime format\nplant_1_generation_df[\"DATE_TIME\"] = pd.to_datetime(plant_1_generation_df[\"DATE_TIME\"])\nplant_1_sensor_df[\"DATE_TIME\"] = pd.to_datetime(plant_1_sensor_df[\"DATE_TIME\"])\nplant_2_generation_df[\"DATE_TIME\"] = pd.to_datetime(plant_2_generation_df[\"DATE_TIME\"])\nplant_2_sensor_df[\"DATE_TIME\"] = pd.to_datetime(plant_2_sensor_df[\"DATE_TIME\"])\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check the dtype of the DATE_TIME column to make sure we reformatted correctly\nplant_1_generation_df['DATE_TIME'].dtype","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check a few DATE_TIME rows\nplant_1_generation_df[[\"DATE_TIME\", \"DC_POWER\"]]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create 4 scatter plots comparing DATE_TIME to DC_POWER and IRRADIATION levels\n# We want to see how the data looks across time.\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.scatterplot(plant_1_generation_df[\"DATE_TIME\"], plant_1_generation_df[\"DC_POWER\"], ax=axes[0,0])\nsns.scatterplot(plant_1_sensor_df[\"DATE_TIME\"], plant_1_sensor_df[\"IRRADIATION\"], ax=axes[0,1])\nsns.scatterplot(plant_2_generation_df[\"DATE_TIME\"], plant_2_generation_df[\"DC_POWER\"], ax=axes[1,0])\nsns.scatterplot(plant_2_sensor_df[\"DATE_TIME\"], plant_2_sensor_df[\"IRRADIATION\"], ax=axes[1,1])\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"All recordings appear to have occurred in the year 2020.

The Daily yield begins a gradual increase as the hour increases, then begins a significant increase up to a certain point (around the same point that DC and AC Power begins its decline) then flattens out as DC and AC power fall back to lower points.

The daily yield will start low, then as the hours of the day brings more sunlight, thus more AC/DC power, daily yield will begin to increase.
