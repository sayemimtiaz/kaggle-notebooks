These SNPs have no known clinical significance and should be investigated further. \n\nTask 2: machine learning indentified GDF6 and AC096719.1 as key predictive features.  AC096719.1 is a novel transcript and should be studied. Limb origination cases show statistically lower GDF6 expression and perhaps this subset of cases could benefit from growth factor supplementation.\n\nTask 3: machine learning identified two proteins that have been previously mentioned as having ALS involvement in the literature.  APEH is also involved in protein degradation and AOX3 has been suggested in previous reports as a possible target for therapeutic intervention.\n\nIn conclusion, this dataset contains some interesting insights into ALS etiology and pathology.  We should be careful about model overfitting with only ~130 patients and >180,000 features in these joined datasets, but efforts were taken to reduce overfitting.  Ultimately increasing the number of participants in the study and adding additional omic information (methylation and microbiome) should uncover new therapeutic targets and

after balancing and normalizing the input data.  I used the SMOTE implementation to upsample the ctrl cases.  Without balancing the classes, the model makes only trivial predictions with the output vector being all \"1\" class.  By balancing example numbers of case and ctrl (real + synthetic), the model achieved improved ROC AUC.  \n\nThe high accuracy of the model tells us that there is good information in this dataset that should inform us about the underlying causes of ALS.  However, looking at the feature importance, it is clear that there are many features with roughly equal importance, indicating that ALS is a complicated interaction between many SNPs and gene expression levels.  I looked through the features with high importance in RF feature ranking and SHAP plot, and summarized key findings in the table below.\n\n| SNP|GENES|biochemical pathways|clinVar|known association with CNS disease|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| rs750805176  | SEPTIN2  |microtubles and filaments   |not reported in ClinVar   |Yes, associated with neurofibrillary tangles, pathology in Alzheimer's    |\n| rs577067524  | MMP24  |ECM breakdown and remodeling   |not reported in ClinVar   |Yes, controls neuroinflammation.  Known Tx target for AD/ALS/PD/HD/MS   |\n| chr7:111801687  | DOCK4  |cytokinesis and adheren regulation |NA |mutations a topic of research in ALZ/ALS |\n\n\n**rs577067524** - this indel mutation impacts MMP24, a metalloproteinase involved in neuroinflammation. MMPs are a prime suspect in ALS and are considered a potential therapeutic target (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4619970/). Considering the known role of MMPs in neurodegeneration, this SNP should be looked at closely as there are no publications or clinvar reports in dbSNP.  The mutated protein should be synthesized and we should study whether this mutant has any altered enzymatic function.\n\n**rs750805176** - this frameshift mutation impacts SEPTIN2 coding. Knowndown of SEPTIN2 has been shown to cause actin fiber disintegration and cell polarity loss (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2085444/). SEPTIN2 has also been associated with neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908411003609). Since actin and microtuble pathways are suspect in ALS, this mutation should be looked at closely.\n\n**chr7:111801687** - mutation in a part of the genome coding for DOCK4 and a member of Guanine Exchange Factors (GEF) family which have been a topic of active interest in Alzheimer's and ALS (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2014.00282/full).\n\nNext, I wanted to compare the distribution of SNPs between case and control classes and check if any of the suspect SNPs above show a strong discrepancy between classes.  I calculated the percent of participants per class with that particular SNP and plotted the top 10 SNPs with the biggest delta between case/control and summarized in the table below.\n\n| SNP|observed in ctrl|GENES|biochemical pathways|clinVar|known association with CNS disease|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| rs750805176  | yes|SEPTIN2  |microtubles and filaments   |not reported in ClinVar   |Yes, associated with neurofibrillary tangles, pathology in Alzheimer's    |\n| chr7:111801687  | no|DOCK4|cytokinesis and adheren regulation    | NA  | mutations a topic of research in ALZ/ALS  |\n| rs757676742  |yes|UBXN11|actin pathways|not reported in ClinVar | no  |\n|chr19:42321227 | no|TMEM145 |GPCR | NA  | no  |\n| chr6:3289981  | yes|SLC22A3,PSMG4 |transmembrane, assembly chaperone|NA|no  |\n| chr1:61918051  | no|PATJ |mediates protein-protein interactions|NA|no  |\n| rs561262047  | yes|ZNF714 |transcriptional regulation |not reported in ClinVar | no |\n| chr15:43783008  |yes|SERF2|protein-protein interactions including ubiquitin|NA|Yes, speculated to be involved in ubiquitin pathways in AD|\n| chr12:121240525  |no|CAMKK2|regulates neuropeptide Y|NA| no |\n| chr3:50118454  | no |unknown |unknown |unknown  |\n\n\nSure enough, **rs750805176** and **chr7:111801687** show a large difference between case/control abundance.   Most of the remaining SNPs identified with this method do not have any known association with CNS disease, with the exception of chr15:43783008 / SERF2.  SERF2 plays an important role in the ubiquitin pathway, and knockout of this gene led to accumulation of toxic plaques in ALZ models (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33143-1).\n\nI also compared RNA seq expression levels between control and case and similarly plotted the top 10 genes with the largest difference in expression.  The top genes (233864,USP9Y,ZFY,PRKY,DDX3Y) were all located on the Y chromosome or associated with male fertility.  This suggests that being male is a risk factor for ALS.  In the future, we should filter proteins expressed in only one sex.\n\nIn summary, a combination of machine learning and pseudo-gwas revealed four interesting mutations that require additional study. SNPs in the coding regions for SEPTIN2, MMP24, DOCK4, and SERF2 were identified as very significant by this approach even though they have no known clinical significance in clinVar. Given that these genes all have plausible roles in ALS, we should test if these specific mutations result in loss of function. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Task #2.
