This network contains various kinds of information. For example, it can be used to find the most influential papers. Or when looking at a specific paper, you can find papers that indirectly reference it or are indirectly referenced by it. When looking at multiple papers, you can see how they are connected. More complex information can also be extracted.\n\nAbout two thirds of the papers in the dataset have json files that include the references. This notebook extracts those references and saves the network. It also shows two examples of how the network can be used in other tools.\n\nThe network is a graph with the papers as nodes and the references as directed edges. The papers are identified by their titles, and the references are identified by a pair of titles. The network can be imported in graph tools such as Neo4j or Gephi, which can be used to query various aspects of the network and visualise it.\n\nThe repository with the code for this project can be found on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/norico.groeneveld/covid-19-research-graph).\n\nYou can also go straight to [the visualisation](https://noricogroeneveld.gitlab.io/covid-19-research-visualisation/)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from datetime import datetime\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport ujson\n\nINPUT_PATH = '../input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'\nOUTPUT_PATH = ''\n\n# function to log status, combined with time since start\nstart_time = datetime.now()\ndef print_status(message):\n    seconds = (datetime.now() - start_time).seconds\n    minutes = seconds // 60\n    seconds = seconds - (minutes * 60)\n    print(f'{minutes:02}:{seconds:02} - {message}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading\nIn order to add the references to the graph, we need to read the json files.

They are ready to be imported in Neo4j or Gephi for analysis or visualisation. Other tools can be used as well, with the same csv files or slightly modified ones.\n\n[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a graph database, which is useful for data with many-to-many relationships. It uses the Cypher Query Language and has a Browser to execute queries and view the results. [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) is a program for the visualisation of graphs. It has an interface that's not very complicated, though the number of options can be overwhelming.\n\n# Neo4j import\nCreate a database and put the csv files in the corresponding import folder. Open Neo4j Browser and execute the following three Cypher queries. You might have to change the filenames.\n```\nCREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Paper) ASSERT p.title IS UNIQUE;\n\n:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT\nLOAD CSV FROM 'file:///neo_nodes.csv' AS line\nCREATE (:Paper { title: line[0]});\n\n:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT\nLOAD CSV FROM 'file:///neo_edges.csv' AS line\nMATCH (paper1:Paper { title: line[0]}),(paper2:Paper { title: line[1]})\nCREATE (paper1)-[:REFERENCES]->(paper2);\n```\nAfter that, all the data is loaded and ready to be queried. As an example, you can find the most referenced papers and the references between them.\n```\nMATCH ()-[r]->(n)\nWITH n, count(r) as relcnt\nWHERE relcnt > 200\nRETURN n, relcnt;\n```\n\n# Gephi import and visualisation\n* From the tools menu, make sure the following plugins are installed: Circle Pack, SigmaJS exporter.\n* From the file menu, open the csv file with nodes and follow the steps. Set the Graph Type to Directed.\n* After that, open the csv file with edges. The only change you need to make is to append it to the current workspace instead of creating a new one.\n* In the Statistics panel, run Modularity. There is no need to use weights, but set the Resolution 2 when you use many papers. The Modularity algorithm clusters the papers into highly connected communities.\n* In the Appearance panel, set the node color to Partition using Modularity Class, optionally change the colors for some classes, and apply it.\n* In the same panel, set the node size to Ranking using referenced, with size 5 to 50 (or 100 if using many papers), and apply it\n* In the Layout panel, select Circle Pack Layout, set Hierarchy1 to Modularity Class and run it.\n* In the Preview tab, set the Border With of Nodes to 0. Refresh to see the preview.\n* From the file menu, export the graph as Sigma.js template. Enable *Include search* and *Group edges by direction*, and set the *Group Selector* To *Modularity class*. Make sure that the option *Replace node ids with numbers* is disabled. \n* To view the result, run *python -m http.server* in the folder with the Sigma.js template. It can also be uploaded, for example to Github Pages or Gitlab Pages. The nodes are smaller than in Gephi, but you can increase the *maxNodeSize* property in the *config.json* file. \n\n\nIn the exported visualisation, you can select a paper and view its properties and connections. It is also possible to search for a paper or select a modularity cluster.\nI created two exports, one with the papers in the dataset that are referenced at least 5 times, and another one with all papers (including those outside the dataset) that are referenced at least twice.\nHere are links to view the [first visualisation](https://noricogroeneveld.gitlab.io/covid-19-research-visualisation/) and the [larger second visualisation](https://noricogroeneveld.gitlab.io/covid-19-research-visualisation/full/). The large visualisation has a large data file, so it takes a while to load and is slower.\n\nGephi can also be used to calculate properties of the graph, for example with the Pagerank algorithm.\n\n\n# Next steps\n* There are more ways to visualise or query the graph and gain information from it. There is research about research graph, which can help with that.\n* The visualisation can be improved, especially regarding the paper attributes.\n* There are various edge cases that can be dealt with in a better way. It is assumed that titles and references are unique, but this is probably not the case. Duplicate titles might belong to papers that are actually different, but now they are combined. There are also some titles that clearly aren't a normal title for a paper.\n* There is more information in the dataset. The most relevant are authors, laboratories, institutions and journals. They can be added to the network as new nodes and edges, or as extra data for the current nodes.\n* It is possible to extract the sentence that a reference is used in, to give more context about the relationship.\n* Other sources might have extra research on COVID-19 to add to the graph.\n\n\n# Related solutions\nFor COVID-19 research, there are two related solutions. The [references-based atlas notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mmoeller/a-references-based-atlas-of-covid-19-research) by Moritz Moeller extracts the references from PubMed and visualises them with Gephi. On [covid.curiosity.ai](https://covid.curiosity.ai/) you can use a graph-based search engine with various exploration features.\n\nThere are also various projects related to research graphs in general, including: [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/), [OpenAIRE Research Graph](https://www.openaire.eu/blogs/the-openaire-research-graph), [ResearchGraph](https://researchgraph.org/), [Project Freya PID Graph](https://www.project-freya.eu/en/blogs/blogs/the-pid-graph) and the [Open Research Knowledge Graph](https://projects.tib.eu/orkg)."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
