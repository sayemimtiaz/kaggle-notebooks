Introduction\n\nIt's \"economy time that nobody asked for, but I'm still giving it to you.\"\n\nSome quick back stories before we begin:\n\n1. **US Treasury Yield Curve** is a line that plots on the X axis the \"Years of Maturity\", meaning the amount of time it takes for a debt to be paid and on the Y axis the value of the \"Yield\" (or the interest rate).\n\n2. **Years of Maturity**: the debt can be made, as any debt, on different periods of time: could be made for 1 month, or it could be made for 30 years.\n\nHow does the picture usually look like? Naturally, the interest *rates are small for short periods of time and long for longer periods of time*, right? (I'll insert a photo for your refference below, look at the blue line).\n\n![image.png](https://i.imgur.com/5e5tjUZ.png)\n\nBut, sometimes, this \"naturality\" inverts itself (red line), meaning that the interests are bigger for short period debts and smaller for longer periods.\n\n### This phenomena is widely thought by the economists being a **prediction for a recession**. But how good of a prediction?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport scipy as sp\n\n# Read the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/data-yield-curve/Data Yield Curve.csv\")\n\n# Rename CHHUSD in CHFUSD\ndata.rename(columns = {'CHHUSD':'CHFUSD'}, inplace = True)\n\n# Create variable year\ndata['Year'] = data['Date'].apply(lambda i: i.split('-')[0]).astype(int)\n\n# Yield Curve Inverted\ninverted_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/data-yield-curve/Yield-curve-inverted.csv\")\ndf = pd.melt(inverted_data, id_vars='Maturities', value_vars=['23.08.2019', '23.08.2018'], var_name='Dates')\n\n# Visuals setup\nsns.set(style = 'whitegrid')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

Wow. The 2 yield curves were on average inverted for 4 years. This is marking the **US Recession that started in 1980**.\n2. Another touch in 1989. This is also marking the **US early 1990 Recession**, which was relatively mild, but still existed. (quite accurate!)\n3. The year 2000. This is starting to look like a very good predictor. The **recessions in 2000** affected mostly the developed countries, and in US was coused by the Market Bubble.\n4. Well this is actually ridiculous! Another touch in **2006**. I don't even need to address that period. US economy and employment had a slowdown, while the debts were rising. It was the climax for the **recession in 2008**.\n\nAnd now we're approaching to the present. And as you can see from the second graph, that line is slowly but surely approaching the 0 line, where the difference between the 30 Yr Maturity and the 1 Yr Maturity is becoming negative. \n\nSeems that we have a big nasty surprise coming towards us.\n\n# 5.
