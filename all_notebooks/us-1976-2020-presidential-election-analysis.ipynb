Methodology\n\nThe presidential election in the US is popularly known about the competitive of 2 candidates. However, the fact is, there are more than 2 candidates in this final round. They come from smaller parties than the famous Republican and Democratic parties. To make the analysis more concentrate, I will only focus on these 2 parties which get the most support from American voters. Republic and Democrat. The race to the white house is not only about getting more public interest than the challenger but also reach the threshold of 270 Electrol college votes. Each state has a fixed number of college votes, and in all states but Maine and Nebraska, if a candidate wins popular, he gets all the electoral college. In this analysis, I will not dig into the details of election policies change over the years, but focus on popular votes and assume electoral votes by:\n\nMaine and Nebraska: Candidates share the college votes by their popular vote rates, round the number to an integer. (In real life, using the 'congressional district method', these states allocate two electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each Congressional district (2 in Maine, 3 in Nebraska). Maine enacted this rule in advance of the 1972 presidential election, while Nebraska enacted it starting with the 1992 election.\n'Winner takes it all' for all other states.\nThe result of electoral college votes sightly differ from the official results. However, it does not change the outcome to make the elected-president.\n\nThe data for the election this year is incompleted, some states are still carry on counting ballots, so this result is NOT the official outcome.
