Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n\nIn this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='pose_questions'></a>\n## Posing Questions\n\nBefore looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n\n**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n\n**Answer**: \n- First question is that in which month the users uses the bike most?. We can give discount to the user according to this.\n- what is the most popular hour / weekday for three city ?\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0dd1b8df35774af52fa624fa3d25c3760c545627"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='wrangling'></a>\n## Data Collection and Wrangling\n\nNow it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:\n\n- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)\n- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)\n- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)\n\nIf you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. **However, you do not need to download the data yourself.** The data has already been collected for you in the `/data/` folder of the project files. While the original data for 2016 is spread among multiple files for each city, the files in the `/data/` folder collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city. Some data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city has already been performed for you. In addition, a random 2% sample of the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable. \n\n**Question 2**: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c9c171940dc6cf23b9f47ca482286f02e6cba3e6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"## import all necessary packages and functions.\nimport csv # read and write csv files\nfrom datetime import datetime # operations to parse dates\nfrom pprint import pprint # use to print data structures like dictionaries in\n                          # a nicer way than the base print function.\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"369dd22adf567dc4091cb6323d86681807fbaebf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def print_first_point(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints and returns the first data point (second row) from\n    a csv file that includes a header row.\n    \"\"\"\n    # print city name for reference\n    city = filename.split('-')[0].split('/')[-1]\n    print('\\nCity: {}'.format(city))\n    \n    with open(filename, 'r') as f_in:\n        ## TODO: Use the csv library to set up a DictReader object. ##\n        ## see https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html           ##\n        trip_reader =csv.DictReader(f_in)\n        \n        ## TODO: Use a function on the DictReader object to read the     ##\n        ## first trip from the data file and store it in a variable.     ##\n        ## see https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#reader-objects ##\n        first_trip = next(trip_reader)\n        \n        ## TODO: Use the pprint library to print the first trip. ##\n        ## see https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html     ##\n        pprint(first_trip)\n        \n    # output city name and first trip for later testing\n    return (city, first_trip)\n\n# list of files for each city\ndata_files = ['../input/NYC-CitiBike-2016.csv',\n              '../input/Chicago-Divvy-2016.csv',\n              '../input/Washington-CapitalBikeshare-2016.csv',]\n\n# print the first trip from each file, store in dictionary\nexample_trips = {}\nfor data_file in data_files:\n    city, first_trip = print_first_point(data_file)\n    example_trips[city] = first_trip","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"81648d2b0a1cc7f927597944ebe56fc6b35ad6f0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If everything has been filled out correctly, you should see below the printout of each city name (which has been parsed from the data file name) that the first trip has been parsed in the form of a dictionary. When you set up a `DictReader` object, the first row of the data file is normally interpreted as column names. Every other row in the data file will use those column names as keys, as a dictionary is generated for each row.\n\nThis will be useful since we can refer to quantities by an easily-understandable label instead of just a numeric index. For example, if we have a trip stored in the variable `row`, then we would rather get the trip duration from `row['duration']` instead of `row[0]`.\n\n<a id='condensing'></a>\n### Condensing the Trip Data\n\nIt should also be observable from the above printout that each city provides different information. Even where the information is the same, the column names and formats are sometimes different. To make things as simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim and clean the data. Cleaning the data makes sure that the data formats across the cities are consistent, while trimming focuses only on the parts of the data we are most interested in to make the exploration easier to work with.\n\nYou will generate new data files with five values of interest for each trip: trip duration, starting month, starting hour, day of the week, and user type. Each of these may require additional wrangling depending on the city:\n\n- **Duration**: This has been given to us in seconds (New York, Chicago) or milliseconds (Washington). A more natural unit of analysis will be if all the trip durations are given in terms of minutes.\n- **Month**, **Hour**, **Day of Week**: Ridership volume is likely to change based on the season, time of day, and whether it is a weekday or weekend. Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n- **User Type**: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two.\n\n\n**Question 3a**: Complete the helper functions in the code cells below to address each of the cleaning tasks described above."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"21ab315bade45cd83627aba4b49a32078f5bde1b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def duration_in_mins(datum, city):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes as input a dictionary containing info about a single trip (datum) and\n    its origin city (city) and returns the trip duration in units of minutes.\n    \n    Remember that Washington is in terms of milliseconds while Chicago and NYC\n    are in terms of seconds. \n    \n    HINT: The csv module reads in all of the data as strings, including numeric\n    values.

The plot consists of one extremely tall bar on the left, maybe a very short second bar, and a whole lot of empty space in the center and right. Take a look at the duration values on the x-axis. This suggests that there are some highly infrequent outliers in the data. Instead of reprocessing the data, you will use additional parameters with the `.hist()` function to limit the range of data that is plotted. Documentation for the function can be found [[here]](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html#matplotlib.pyplot.hist).\n\n**Question 5**: Use the parameters of the `.hist()` function to plot the distribution of trip times for the Subscribers in your selected city. Do the same thing for only the Customers. Add limits to the plots so that only trips of duration less than 75 minutes are plotted. As a bonus, set the plots up so that bars are in five-minute wide intervals. For each group, where is the peak of each distribution? How would you describe the shape of each distribution?\n\n**Answer**: Since you said to plot for one city, i choose to plot of **Chicago** city. For Subscriber group, the peak value of trip distribution is **5-10** Minutes and for Customer group, the peak of the trip distribution is **20-25** Minutes. As we can see that the distribution of trip duration in chicago city for customers is more likely to be **Normal Distribution(Bell-Shaped)**.

You have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S. cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one of these cities, you have investigated differences between Subscribers and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts. Now it is your turn to continue the exploration in a direction that you choose. Here are a few suggestions for questions to explore:\n\n- How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?\n- Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?\n- During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?\n\nIf any of the questions you posed in your answer to question 1 align with the bullet points above, this is a good opportunity to investigate one of them. As part of your investigation, you will need to create a visualization. If you want to create something other than a histogram, then you might want to consult the [Pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/pyplot_summary.html). In particular, if you are plotting values across a categorical variable (e.g. city, user type), a bar chart will be useful. The [documentation page for `.bar()`](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html#matplotlib.pyplot.bar) includes links at the bottom of the page with examples for you to build off of for your own use.\n\n**Question 6**: Continue the investigation by exploring another question that could be answered by the data available. Document the question you want to explore below. Your investigation should involve at least two variables and should compare at least two groups. You should also use at least one visualization as part of your explorations.\n\n**Question**: How does ridership differ by month? Which month has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month?\n\n**Answer**:  Since you said to investigate for one city, i choose the Washington City.\n- In Washington City:<br>\n  The firts bar chart shows the total number of riders in washington city in each month. According to this bar chart we can say   that highest number of users are in the month of june and july. <br>\n  The second bar chart shows the total number of subscribers and customers in each month. According to this bar chart we see       more Subscribers than Customers in each of the month.<br>\n  The third bar chart shows the ratio of Subscriber trip to Customer trip change depending on the month.According to this we can   say that the ratio between them is higher in the month of January, Febuary and December and in the month of May, June and July.
