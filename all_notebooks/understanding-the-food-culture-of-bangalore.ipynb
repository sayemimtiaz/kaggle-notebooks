Also, the number of votes by the customer is an indication of the number of footfalls in the restaurant. Going by the Vote count, we can see that the number of restaurants serving a cuisine is somewhat proportional to the number of footfalls recieved by the restaurant, for most cuisines, which is expected. However, from the plots, it is apparent that the footfall of the continental restaurants are more than chinese restaurants, even though they are less in number. The same arguments goes for cafes.\nHence, the following conclusion can be drawn. \n\n*Conclusion 1:* **Bangalore loves continental foods.
