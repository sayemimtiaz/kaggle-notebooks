Interpretable Machine Learning** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n- Machine learning has great potential for improving products, processes and services. A dataset is supplied as input and algorithms produce the desired output. But, algorithms do not explain their predictions. It acts as a barrier to the adoption of machine learning. In this case, interpretable machine learning models come to the rescue.\n\n- Tim Miller - “Explanation in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Social Sciences.” defines interpretability as -\n\n    **“the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision in a model”.** So it means it’s something        that you achieve in some sort of “degree”.       \n       \n- In the context of machine learning, interpretability helps us to understand how a model has made a particular decision. \n\n- Our model should be interpretable and they should also display the following traits:-\n\n  - 1 **Fairness**  -  Ensuring that predictions are unbiased and do not implicitly or explicitly discriminate against protected groups. An interpretable model can tell you why it has decided that a certain person should not get a loan, and it becomes easier for a human to judge whether the decision is based on a learned demographic (e.g. racial) bias.\n  - 2 **Privacy**  -  Ensuring that sensitive information in the data is protected.\n  - 3 **Reliability or Robustness**  -  Ensuring that small changes in the input do not lead to large changes in the prediction.\n  - 4 **Causality**  -  Check that only causal relationships are picked up.\n  - 5 **Trust**  -  It is easier for humans to trust a system that explains its decisions compared to a black box.   \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Most commonly used methods for explainability**\n\n- These methods do not rely on any particularity of the model. The advantage of these methods lies in their flexibility. Machine learning developers are free to use any machine learning model they like. The interpretation methods can be applied to any model.

It has optimized functions for interpreting tree-based models and a model agnostic explainer function for interpreting any black-box model for which the predictions are known.\n\n- Lundberg and Lee implemented SHAP in the [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) Python package. This implementation works for tree-based models in the scikit-learn machine learning library for Python.\n\n- The SHAP authors proposed **KernelSHAP**, an alternative, kernel-based estimation approach for Shapley values inspired by [local surrogate models](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html#lime). \n\n- Also they proposed **TreeSHAP**, an efficient estimation approach for tree-based models. \n\n- [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) comes with many global interpretation methods based on aggregations of Shapley values. We will demonstrate them in this kernel.\n\n- For an in-depth discussion of [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) , please read the chapter - [SHAP](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html).\n\n- Now, let's get to the implementation."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **3.

But with the Python shap package comes a different visualization: You can visualize feature attributions such as Shapley values as “forces”. Each feature value is a force that either increases or decreases the prediction. The prediction starts from the baseline. The baseline for Shapley values is the average of all predictions. In the plot, each Shapley value is an arrow that pushes to increase (positive value) or decrease (negative value) the prediction.
