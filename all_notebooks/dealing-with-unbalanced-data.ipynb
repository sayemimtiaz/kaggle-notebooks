fundamental to guarantee adjusted models and analyzes.\nWorking with unbalanced datasets can cause errors in our algorithms such as overfing, since the frequency of a given event is substantially higher than the other.\n\nIn our study we will assume that the variable \"obj1\" represents the occurrence of failure in a given production line.\n\nbeing:\n\n0 - Conforming product\n\n1 - Product with failure\n\nTherefore, if we wanted to study which variables are having the greatest impact on product failure, it is necessary to balance the data, even before dividing between training and test
