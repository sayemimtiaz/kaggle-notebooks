When I explained that I was using his dataset and would stand to benefit from a revised version, he was kind enough to promptly update his dataset (which previously contained entries upto 19-01-2021) to include data upto the current date. If you haven't already, I strongly encourage you to upvote his dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/josephassaker/covid19-global-dataset). \n\n\n# Introduction\n\nIt has been over a full year since we started this difficult battle against Covid-19 and it has cost us dearly. These fast-spreading microscopic creatures that are too small to be even be seen with the naked eye have somehow shaken the entire world and changed life as we know it. \n\nPeople all over the world are racing against the clock to fight this pandemic. We, the bright minds of Kaggle can do our part by using our skills to generate powerful insight that can make the lives of those affected a little better. \n\nEvery day, there's an abundance of data being made publicly available on Kaggle, each one containing different statistics surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. The goal in this notebook, is to bring two such datasets together and generate a holistic view on how we, as a species have been fighting this virus. \n\nI will update it often to make sure it contains the most relevant information. Feel free to leave any ideas or links to other datasets and notebooks that you feel would benefit this notebook.\n\nIf you like this notebook and the approach, an **upvote** would be massively encouraging! Cheers. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Technology Stack\nIn this analysis, I used python as the primary programming language because of its rich palette of tools that make data analysis a cinch. Some of the python packages I used are:\n1. Plotly is an extremely versatile library of tools for generating interactive plots that are easy to interpret and customise\n2. Numpy is a popular library used for array manipulation and vector operations. It is used extensively across python projects that require scientific computing.\n3. Pandas is another library for data science that is just as popular as numpy. It provides easy to use data structures and functions to manipulate structured data.\n\n\nThese tools are well documented and come with several examples that make it easy to start using them.
