After investigation, they found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such clients.\n\n### Data Science Problem Statement\n\nPredict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the analysis of the marketing campaigns the bank performed.\n\n### Evaluation Metric\nWe will be using Precision/Recall for evaluation. \n\n### Objective of this template notebook\n\nThe main objective of this template is to take you through the entire working pipeline that you may follow while appraoching a Machine Learning problem.\n\nWe will be defining a task to be performed and write the code to solve the task.\n\n__The tasks performed below should serve as a good guide regarding the steps that you should go about a Machine Learning Problem.

It may be blank for 50% (or even more) of the population, but might have very high information about the lifestyle of the person. In such cases, you would still use the variable.\n\nIf the information contained in the variable is not that high, you can drop the variable if it has more than 50% missing values. There are projects / models where imputation of even 20 - 30% missing values provided better results - the famous Titanic dataset on Kaggle being one such case. Age is missing in ~20% of cases, but you benefit by imputing them rather than ignoring the variable.\n\n- Now you have the number and percentage of missing values in every feature, from the previous function. \n- Using this information, you can decide as to what proportion of missing values you should remove from every feature.\n- The code below takes a threshold value of your choice and removes the features having missing value percentage greater than this threshold.
