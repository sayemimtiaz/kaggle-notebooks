It is fundamental to the growth of any nation as it forms the backbone of industrialization. The demand for steel comes primarily from the infrastructure, automobile, and consumer durables industry and the fortunes of steel is highly correlated with these user industries. Steel production in India began with the setting up of Tata Iron & Steel Company (TISCO - now Tata Steel) in1907. In 1947, India had a fledgling private steel industry with only 3 significant steel companies with a total capacity of 1.0 MT.\n> \n> The Indian Steel Industry currently accounts for 2.0 per cent of India’s GDP and employs around 2.5 million people. The low cost of labour and availability of coal and iron ore make India a competitive producer of the metal.India is the 3rd largest producer of steel at 104.8 MT in 2017 and is poised to overtake Japan to become the 2 nd largest manufacturer in 2018 backed by the robust economic activity in the country.\n> \n> India also ranks 4th in steel production capacity in the world and is the 3rd largest consumer of the metal after China and the United States.\n\n> **Industry Structure**\n\n> The industry in India is classified based on the nature of the manufacturing companies into Integrated Steel Producers (ISP) and Secondary Producers. \n> Integrated Steel Producers are companies that are present throughout the steel value chain - starting from the extraction of Iron Ore to the manufacturing and marketing of finished steel. The Integrated Steel Producers account for 43.0 per cent of steel production in India. The largest integrated steel players in India include Steel Authority of India, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (Vizag Steel), Tata Steel, JSW Steel & Power, JSW Steel, Electrosteel and Essar Steel. Other major\n> players include Jindal Stainless Steel and Jindal Stainless Steel (Hisar) Secondary Producers are generally smaller manufacturers who manufacture steel from sponge iron and scrap. The secondary manufacturers manufacture steel using Mini Blast Furnace, Electric Arc Furnace and Induction Furnace units. The share of secondary producers has been steadily rising in\n> India and in 2011-2012 secondary producers accounted for ~68.0 per cent of steel production in India. \n> \n> In the aftermath of the coal scam in 2012-2013, the ISPs could better cope with the economic uncertainty and saw a growth of 41.0 per cent in production as against secondary producers’ who saw production decline by 11.4 per cent in the corresponding period.\n\n\nSource: https://rbsa.in/archives_of_research_reports/RBSA_Indian_Steel_Industry_Analysis.pdf\n\nI will be using the above report as a reference to explore the data that is available to see to see if there is a change in trend of Steel Industry post the coam scal in 2012-2013.

The added elements provide the steel with ductility and strength. During the smelting process, other elements, such as aluminum is added to the steel making it an alloy steel. Alloy steels have enhanced properties due to the larger proportion of elements such as manganese and silicon present in carbon steels. Non-alloy steel has no elements added to the steel as it is smelted.\n\n**SEMI-FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS (SEMIS):**\n\nIntermediate solid steel products obtained by Hot rolling/Forging of ingots (in conventional process) or by Continuous casting of liquid steel are known as Semis. These are called so since they are intended for further rolling/forging to produce finished steel products. Semi-finished casting products are intermediate castings produced in a steel mill that need further processing before being a finished good. There are four types: ingots, blooms, billets, and slabs. \n\n![SEMIS](https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-1-4614-1945-7_24/MediaObjects/271092_1_En_24_Fig3_HTML.gif)\n\n\n\nSource: https://media.springernature.com/original/springer-static/image/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-1-4614-1945-7_24/MediaObjects/271092_1_En_24_Fig3_HTML.gif\n\n\n*FINISHED STEEL:*\n\nThese are products obtained upon hot rolling/forging of semi-finished steel (blooms/billets/slabs). These cover 2 broad categories of products, namely Long Products and Flat Products:\n\n***Long products***\nLong products are used in all industrial sectors, particularly in the construction and engineering industries. The group makes heavy long products, light long products and wire-drawn products.\n\n***Flat products***\nA type that is produced by rolls with smooth surfaces and ranges of dimension, varying in thickness. The two major flat steel product categories are thin, flat products (between 1mm and 10mm in thickness) and plates (between 10mm and 200mm thick and used for large welded pipes, ship building, construction, major works and boilers).\n\nRead more about terminology here - https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/news-and-media/factfile/steel-terminology \n\n## Steel Use\n\n![STEEL USE](https://www.readkong.com/static/67/23/6723a9f0ea49b38cf22fcf25d566d6ec/indian-steel-industry-analysis-june-2018-1228002-4.jpg)\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.readkong.com/static/67/23/6723a9f0ea49b38cf22fcf25d566d6ec/indian-steel-industry-analysis-june-2018-1228002-4.jpg\n\n\nGiven these details, let's explore the data now.\n\n# Data Exploration\n\n## (1a) Total Import and Export of Finished Steel (2013-2018):"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cat_import_df = import_df.groupby(by=['Category'])['2013-14','2014-15','2015-16','2016-17','2017-18'].sum().reset_index().sort_values(by=['2013-14','2014-15','2015-16','2016-17','2017-18'], ascending=False)\ncat_import_df['Total'] = cat_import_df.apply(lambda row: row['2013-14'] + row['2014-15'] + row['2015-16'] + row['2016-17'] + row['2017-18'], axis = 1) \n\ncat_export_df = export_df.groupby(by=['Category'])['2013-14','2014-15','2015-16','2016-17','2017-18'].sum().reset_index().sort_values(by=['2013-14','2014-15','2015-16','2016-17','2017-18'], ascending=False)\ncat_export_df['Total'] = cat_export_df.apply(lambda row: row['2013-14'] + row['2014-15'] + row['2015-16'] + row['2016-17'] + row['2017-18'], axis = 1) \n\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(20,10), sharey=True)\nplt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.3)\nsns.barplot(cat_import_df['Category'],cat_import_df['Total'],ax=ax[0])\nax[0].set_title(\"Import\")\nax[0].set_ylabel('Total')\nsns.barplot(cat_export_df['Category'],cat_export_df['Total'],ax=ax[1])\nax[1].set_title(\"Export\")\nax[1].set_ylabel('Total')\nfig.suptitle('Total Import/Export from 2013-2018',fontsize=18)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our total import is a little above 60 million tonnes, export is close to 60 million, whereas alloy imports are close to 10 million.

Non-Flat products include Bars, Rods and Structurals.\n> \n> Flat products production has grown at the rate of 4.9 per cent between FY2014 and FY2017 forming 52.9 per cent of non-alloyed steel production in India at 49.3 MT. \n> Non-flat products production has grown at the rate of 5.6 per cent between FY2014 and FY2017 forming 47.1 per cent of non-alloyed steel production in India at 44.0 MT\n\nAs the report claims, we can see the increase in the export charts for Flat/Non Flat Non-Alloy Finished Steel. \nThe Export charts for Alloy steel also how an increase in 2017 thus, going by the report.\n\nThis concludes the purpose of this kernel. Hope this helps!
