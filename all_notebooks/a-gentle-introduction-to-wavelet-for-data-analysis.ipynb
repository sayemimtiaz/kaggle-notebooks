I wanted to use continuous wavelet transform to plot a spectrum of the dataset to get quick insights. Wavelets are specially well suited for this job. I expected to be able from **python** to do something like `view(data, scales)`,  and get a plot with *meaningful* labels on the axis.  As I did not used wavelets for quite some time, it did not went that way and I spent quite a long time to get painfully some visualization with the Y axis labelled either in frequency or periods units. Very frustrating!\n\nHence as wavelets should be easyly accessible from python I wrote a simple PyPi module `scaleogram` dedicated to plot the continuous wavelet transform.  It has been written to be easily accessible to complete beginners, provide usefull error  messages and packed with online help explaining what is computed under the hood. The following examples are based on this module."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":false,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# currently (03/2019) scaleogram needs install via https://github.com/alsauve/scaleogram\n# because an old PyWavelets (0.5.2) is installend and PyWavelets > 1.0 is needed\nimport scaleogram as scg \nimport pywt\n\n# choose default wavelet function for the entire notebook\nscg.set_default_wavelet('cmor1-1.5')\n\n# Try these ones to see various compromises between scales and time resolution \n#scg.set_default_wavelet('cgau5')\n#scg.set_default_wavelet('cgau1')\n#scg.set_default_wavelet('shan0.5-2')\n#scg.set_default_wavelet('mexh')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4bb4bbdf75ea6ec03d5a102f8af50a4a54d4d880"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What is a scaleogram?\n\nIn the wavelet formalism, a scaleogram is a 2D representation of 1D data with\n* On the X axis the time\n* On the Y axis the scale   \n    The scale correspond to the signal periodicity to which the transform is sentitive to.  \n* The value correspond to the amplitude of the signal variation measured  \n    These variations are located at time X  and have a periodicity Y\n\nThis  kind of plot is a special kind of [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram), but in the case of wavelet the resolution in time vary with the scale value on the Y axis. \n\nBut let's look right now to a scaleogram of simple signals.\n\n\n## How periodic variations displays on a scaleogram?\n\nFor the first example, the signal generated is a *cos* wave with a gaussian envelop.

Next an example time ordered dataset has been used to demonstrate step\nby step how the CWT apply to standard data.\n\nThe same methodology can be extended to network traffic analysis to detect unusual behaviours. Try by yourself on your favorite time/space ordered dataset. The CWT is a powerful tool that is growingly used as input for neural networks and can be usedto create new features for classification or anomaly detection.\n\nI did not dive into the variety of wavelet function that can be chosen depending on the property of your signal. Still you can change the `set()` value at the top of this notebook to try other functions like `mexh` or `gaus5`. \n\nHave fun and plussify if you liked this ;-) !\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# See also \n\n[PyWAvelets](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) A fairly complete wavelet library in python\n\n[scaleogram](https://github.com/alsauve/scaleogram) the visualization tool used in this notebook\n\n[A Practical Guide to Wavelet Analysis ](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%281998%29079%3C0061%3AAPGTWA%3E2.0.CO%3B2) - The reference paper for wavelet analysis by Christopher Torrence and Gilbert P.
