(Because of existing Offense Code Group, it will be not used in the analysis.)\n1. **OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP:**  The general name of each crime type.\n1. **OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION:** Explanation of specific crime.\n    (It can be useful for further investigation)\n1. **DISTRICT:**     Code of zone that crime happened.\n    (Because of code is meaningless, it will be changed with name of district)\n1. **REPORTING_AREA:** Area number that crime reported.\n1. **SHOOTING:**    If the crime included shooting, it shows with 'Y'.\n1. **OCCURRED_ON_DATE:** It shows exact time of crime. (year, month, day and time)\n1. **YEAR:**     2015,2016,2017,2018\n1. **MONTH:**    the month that crime happened.\n1. **DAY OF WEEK:** the week that crime happened.\n1. **HOUR:**        the hour that crime happened.\n1. **UCR_PART:** [Uniform Crime Reporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Crime_Reports) Offence types that is defined by The Federal Bureau of Investigation for reporting data on crimes.\n1. **STREET:** the street name that crime happened\n1. **LAT:**    the location latitude that crime happened.\n1. **LONG:** the location longitude that crime happened.\n1. **LOCATION:** the location latitude and longitude together that crime happened.","metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## District Names","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"District code is hard to understand exactly which area it is so I added neighborhoods names to analyze districts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data['district_name'] = data.DISTRICT\n\ndata.district_name.replace({'A1' : 'Downtown',\n'A15': 'Charlestown',\n'A7': 'East Boston',\n'B2': 'Roxbury',\n'B3': 'Mattapan',\n'C6': 'South Boston',\n'C11': 'Dorchester',\n'D4': 'South End',\n'D14': 'Brighton',\n'E5': 'West Roxbury',\n'E13': 'Jamaica Plain',\n'E18':'Hyde Park'}, inplace=True)\n#https://www.boston.gov/departments/police","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Duplication","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I realized that some case written ones more, because even if it was a one case, it could include lots of offense type.

The month also seems to have some influence, with the winter months of February-April having the lowest crime rates, and the summer/early fall months of June-October having the highest crime rates. There is also a spike in crime rates in the month of January.\n\nThe most frequent \"crime\" in Boston are Motor Vehicle Accidents while the second most are Larcenies. Guns are mostly used in Aggravated Assault followed by Homicides. Most of the crime happens in Roxbury numerically, However to consider population parameter, Mattapan has the highest density. \n\nFinally, because UCR Part one is declared as the most serious crimes types, I find valuable to analyse this type more closely;","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"9\"></a><br>\n<font color='Grey'>\n# - Serious Crimes:(UCR Part one)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dfs = data[data.UCR_PART == 'Part One']","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dfs.describe()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Even if the numbers do not have any meaning, it can be said that all variables seems to be correct.
