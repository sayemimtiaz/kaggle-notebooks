Assignments\n### Demo-version\nTo practice with linear models, you can complete [this demo assignment](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a4-demo-sarcasm-detection-with-logit) where you'll build a sarcasm detection model. The assignment is just for you to practice, and goes with [solution](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a4-demo-sarcasm-detection-with-logit-solution).\n\n### Bonus version\nYou can also choose a [\"Bonus Assignments\" tier](https://www.patreon.com/ods_mlcourse) (details are outlined on the [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/) main page) and get a non-demo version of the assignment where you'll guided through working with sparse data, feature engineering, model validation, and the process of competing on Kaggle. The task will be to beat baselines in a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2).

And a [lecture](https://youtu.be/oTXGQ-_oqvI) on YouTube\n- A nice and concise overview of linear models is given in the book [\"Deep Learning\"](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) (I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, and A. Courville).\n- Linear models are covered practically in every ML book. We recommend \"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\" (C. Bishop) and \"Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective\" (K. Murphy).\n- If you prefer a thorough overview of linear model from a statistician's viewpoint, then look at \"The elements of statistical learning\" (T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and J. Friedman).\n- The book \"Machine Learning in Action\" (P. Harrington) will walk you through implementations of classic ML algorithms in pure Python.\n- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) library. These guys work hard on writing really clear documentation.\n- Scipy 2017 [scikit-learn tutorial](https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2017-sklearn) by Alex Gramfort and Andreas Mueller.\n- One more [ML course](https://github.com/diefimov/MTH594_MachineLearning) with very good materials.\n- [Implementations](https://github.com/rushter/MLAlgorithms) of many ML algorithms.
