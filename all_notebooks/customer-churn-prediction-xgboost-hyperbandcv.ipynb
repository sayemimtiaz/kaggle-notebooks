By identifying those customers likely to leave, the company would be well-placed to offer individuals incentives to stay, leading to improved retention and higher returns for every dollar spent on customer acquisition.\n\n\n## 1.2) Methods:\n\nTo accomplish this goal, we will:\n1. Perform **exploratory data analysis** (**EDA**) to derive insights regarding our data's features.\n2. Perform **data cleaning**\n3. Perform **feature engineering**\n4. Train **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost** models to predict customer churn\n5. Perform hyperparameter tuning using the novel **Hyperband** algorithm\n6. Interpret our results using **SHAP** values\n\n\n## 1.3) Findings:\n\n1. Customers who have been with the company longer are less likely to churn (and vice-versa)\n    - 1.5 years with the company marks the \"turning point\" at which a customer is more likely to stay as opposed to churn.\n    - most customers on 2-year contracts have been with the company for at least 3 years, and these customers are more likely to stay.\n2. Customers who experience higher monthly charges are more likely to churn (and vice-versa)\n    - customers with monthly charges below \\\\$70 are less likely to churn, but once a customer's monthly charges go above \\\\$80, then they become more likely to churn.\n    - 2-year contracts help mitigate the risk of a customer churning even if their monthly charges are past the threshold of \\\\$80 and are in the range of \\\\$80-\\\\$100, but once a customer's monthly charges run past \\\\$100, then contract length no longer mitigates the greater risk of them churning.\n3. Customers with poor internet quality, no phone service, no online security, no tech support, or no online backup were those who were more likely to churn (and vice versa)\n    - Likely a proxy for socio-economic status where customers with lower incomes are more likely to churn.\n4. Customers who pay via electronic check were more likely to churn, and those that opted for paper billing were less likely to churn"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Anyway, to further understand how I arrived at the aformentioned conclusions, let me show you my methodology.  \n\nLet's get started!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.0)  Exploratory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\n\n# Install libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\npd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom joblib import dump, load\n\n# Load the data\nX_full = pd.read_csv('../input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv', index_col='customerID')\n\nprint('The table has ', X_full.shape[0], ' unique customers')\nprint('The table has ', X_full.shape[1], ' features')\n\n# Allow us to see all columns of our dataframe\npd.set_option('max_columns', None)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get a sense of our data\nX_full.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.1) Summarize our data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Summarize our data\nX_full.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <h3><center> Interesting Observations: </center></h3>\n1.

However, if there are any entries where `TotalCharges` is 0, then this theory would likely be incorrect because strings representing zero total charge would then be represented as '0' instead of the empty string.\n\nLet's test this theory out by checking whether there are any entries where `TotalCharges` is 0."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check how many 0's are found within 'TotalCharges'\ntotCharges_zeroes = X[X['TotalCharges'] == 0].shape[0]\nprint('There are  ', totCharges_zeroes, \"  representations of '0' found within 'TotalCharges'\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Apparently there are zero representations of '0' found within `TotalCharges`.
