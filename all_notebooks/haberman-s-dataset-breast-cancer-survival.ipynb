This can help confirm the diagnosis and staging of the cancer.\nIf the lymph nodes feel enlarged, it’s likely the cancer has spread. However, if the lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged, it doesn’t mean the nodes are negative (cancer-free).\nThe pathologist checks the nodes under a microscope. Nearly one-third of women with negative lymph nodes based on a physical exam have nodes with cancer found during the pathology exam.

However as we saw from the domain knowledge note, results of physical test and pathological test can vary. Hence additional data of other test results would have probably been more helpful in predicting the results accurately\nAlthough there is a lot of overlapping data in age, we could say early diagnosis leads to better chances of survival. This is intuitive because early diagnosis would mean that the cancer is still at an early stage and can be contained before it spreads\nYear of operation has a lot of overlap and although some years seem to be better than the others, it is difficult to say if year could have a bearing on the chances of survival"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
