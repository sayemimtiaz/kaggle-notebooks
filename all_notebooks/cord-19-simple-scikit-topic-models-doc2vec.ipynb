{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The CORD-19 Research Challenge presents a hard task for those in the Data Sciences.  Using this Dataset is may be difficult to brainstorm how best to extract value from this Dataset for those in Biomedical Research.  The three main objectives I see many taking on in this competition may be document summarization, indexing, question-answer and possible in topic modelling to better navigate the state of research and where possible gaps exist in the literature.  \n  \nIts been a while since last I worked on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it has been amazing to see how far the tooling and methodologies have developed.  The main aim of this notebook is to create an easy to follow structure exploring some techniques for those unfamiliar with NLP and to provide easy to use and integrate pipeline for people to extend on in other work.  \n\nKaggle and their partners must really be commended for compiling a data of such high quality in as short a time-frame as they have.  I have no doubt this will not just keep Data Hobbyist occupied during this time, but also provide valuable insights to researchers hoping to extract value from this corpus. \n\nThe two main methodologies I aimed to focus on where Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Document Embedding.  Using these approaches, I aimed to explore the structure of ongoing research to get a sense of how spread research interests appear at the current moment. For visualization, I opted to explore the use of UMAP to learn a 2D embedding from these Topic Probabilities and Document Vectors to map from their original space of varying density to a lower-dimensional space of uniform density so exploratory clustering could be performed using DBSCAN.  The pipeline of using TSNE/UMAP with DBSCAN is a common pattern in Data Science pipeline as DBSCAN relies on the assumption that clusters have a similar density in order to threshold on eps.  It is also a common pattern for exploratory analysis as it a method by which to easily discover an appropriate number of cluster in the data, provided your hyperparameters are set sensible and visualize complex high dimensional data which may lie on some manifold.
