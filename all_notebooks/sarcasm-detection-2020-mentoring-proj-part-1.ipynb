This project is meant to be a basic introduction into machine learning methods and to help one understand the steps of a data science project. We will investigate the dataset and its features, train a basic machine learning model, and train a more complex NLP-based (Natural Language Processing) machine learning model.\n\nSeries:\n1. Part 1: Exploring Data and Feature Engineering\n2. [Part 2](https://www.kaggle.com/yastapova/sarcasm-detection-2020-mentoring-proj-part-2): Splitting Data and Building a Basic Machine Learning Model\n3. [Part 3](https://www.kaggle.com/yastapova/sarcasm-detection-2020-mentoring-proj-part-3): Building a Text-Based Machine Learning Model\n\n## Goal\nThe goal of the models is to detect sarcasm in Reddit comments. Therefore, we will be utilizing **Supervised Learning** for **Classification**. The resulting model will be a binary classifier because we have two classes: a label of 1 denotes a sarcastic comment and a label of 0 denotes a non-sarcastic comment.\n\n## Background\nA good introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning can be found in [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-part-1-a36d38c7916) by Javaid Nabi. I have also found a textbook by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin, called *Speech and Language Processing*, to be helpful when learning Natural Language Processing techniques. Currenlty, the [introduction](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/SLP/Updates/1.pdf) to the second edition can be found online, as well as the authors' [drafts](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) of other chapters in the new 3rd edition.\n\n## Data\nThe data was gathered by Mikhail Khodak, Nikunj Saunshi, and Kiran Vodrahalli for their paper \"*[A Large Self-Annotated Corpus for Sarcasm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05579)*\" and is hosted [here](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/SARC/0.0/).\n\nCitation:\n```\n@unpublished{SARC,\n  authors={Mikhail Khodak and Nikunj Saunshi and Kiran Vodrahalli},\n  title={A Large Self-Annotated Corpus for Sarcasm},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05579},\n  year=2017\n}\n```\n\nBelow is a code block which contains Python libraries we will use in this project and which also lists the data files attached to this notebook.

The next step that goes hand-in-hand with examining is cleaning the dataset, but since this one is already pre-cleaned we won't have to worry about that.\n\nWhat is the goal of examining the data?\n1. Understand what the features represent\n2. Observe what type of data you are working with (structured vs. unstructured? text, numbers, dates, categories, etc?)\n3. Determine if there are missing values\n4. Identify any anomalies or outliers\n5.

Based on some experience with Reddit, I can also see a few points of interest. I know that comments can have a score determined by how many people upvote or downvote the comment. I assume that is the meaning of the *score* column, and that *ups* and *downs* correspond to upvotes and downvotes, respectively.\n\nThus, I already have a question: how can one have a negative number of upvotes or downvotes? I would expect these numbers to be non-negative. I can also see that the sum of ups and downs does not always equal the score, which I would expect to be true. Finally, I see that many rows in this selection have -1 for both ups and downs, which may be a way to denote missing values. All in all, this tells me that these columns require more scrutiny and/or research.\n\nAnother point of interest is that *author* and *subreddit* both contain repeated values, which makes sense. Finally, I see that there are two date columns: *data* (which contains only year and month) and *created_utc* (which contains a full date and time stamp in what I assume is UTC time).\n\nI also see that each row contains two long text fields: *comment* (which is the comment we are detecting sarcasm in) and *parent_comment* (which is the post to which our comment of interest is a reply).\n\nThe target variable *label* does not look interesting in this view, since I can only see 0s.

Is it true that if we logged on and picked a random post on r/worldnews, we would have a 64% chance of getting a sarcastic one? The correct answer is no, to both questions.\n\nThe reasoning lies in the fact that this dataset is taken from a sample of reddit comments. Not only that, but in order to create this balanced dataset, the authors even further sampled the data to even out the classes. In their paper, the authors state that in their original sample of comments, only 1% were sarcastic. Since this dataset has been manipulated in this way, it gives us a skewed view of comments and subreddits.\n\nWe cannot say from this dataset that *worldnews* and *atheism* are some of the most sarcastic subreddits on the site. We **can** say that they are some of the most sarcastic in our dataset. And it may be true that, as a whole, they tend to be more sarcastic than others.

Specifically, we'll use the *date* column. If we group by the *date*, we can take the average of the *label*, which would be equivalent to calculating the percentage of sarcastic comments.
