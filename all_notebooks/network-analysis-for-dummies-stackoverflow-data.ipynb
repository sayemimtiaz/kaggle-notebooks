Different centrality measures like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality are used to measure influence of nodes in a network.\n\n\n* **Degree Centrality : ** Degree centrality of a node is the fraction of the nodes it's connected to. Intuitively, the greater the degree that node can be more powerful. For example we can think that a twitter celebrity with 1 m follower is more influential than a regular user with 100 followers.\n\n* **Betweenness Centrality :** Betweenness centrality is a measure of centrality in a graph based on the idea of shortest path. Betwenness centrality of node A is fraction of shortest paths that passes through node A. Nodes with high betweeness centrality works as the 'power broker' or the 'bridges' between different isolated parts of a network.\n\nHere we idenfity the top 10 nodes according to both of the centraliy measures, but they overlap a lot , presumably because it's just a co-occurance network of tags and undirected. In a human social network often the people with higher betweenenss centrality are more interesting."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0acac12479fe1aac1532312b4e9d4ca378299469","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"19d3bb01-b392-432c-a182-7cd8d2d99379","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e08eb405fe8fca6debbfd15252020d3897aef646","_cell_guid":"be54f00e-b326-4406-b4b3-cc466b2b34f7","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\ntop_10_nodes_by_degree_centrality = sorted(degree_centrality.items(),key=lambda x:x[1],reverse=True)[0:10]\n\ntop_10_nodes_by_degree_centrality","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a7ccf329dc192f95f05d80b7b1e00399b827a942","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"691cc135-9946-4c7b-9db5-2fc5a23d41a4","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"betweenness_centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5715e9bee8d0d9e1b346983937e6270d26411dde","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"027b1aca-bfaf-4644-9e83-13d2daea4543","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"top_10_nodes_by_betweenness_centrality = sorted(betweenness_centrality.items(),key=lambda x:x[1],reverse=True)[0:10]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6584b19c343a6e277c0106bff46de24163d49998","_cell_guid":"a5ed1a13-2212-4d0b-8515-904849e894f2","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"top_10_nodes_by_betweenness_centrality","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d0f36c7aeed840a36e662a394f4fc77d382b305e","_cell_guid":"83913a13-eaf3-481a-a4ca-2a06200ca077"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# More Resources : \n\n* Datacamp Network Analysis Course Part 1 and 2.\n* https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e81aa50c64dfe56bb780f5b3846ad4120195452e","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"5d373c58-f800-4d0a-957d-92f14a80b18d","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
