I will provide a brief overview of the process here, but a much more in-depth explanation of NLP with [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai/) can be found in [lesson 8](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=8) of the [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai/) course. For convenience clicking on inline code written like [`this`](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.text.html) will take you to the relevant part of the [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai/) documentation where appropriate."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Transfer learning in NLP - the ULMFiT approach\n\nWe will be making use of *transfer learning* to help us create a model to analyse tweet sentiment. The idea behind transfer learning is that neural networks learn information that generalises to new problems, [particularly the early layers of the network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901.pdf). In computer vision, for example, we can take a model that was trained on the ImageNet dataset to recognise different features of images such as circles, then apply that to a smaller dataset and *fine-tune* the model to be more suited to a specific task (e.g. classifying images as cats or dogs). This technique allows us to train neural networks much faster and with far less data than we would otherwise need.\n\nIn 2018 [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) introduced a transfer learning technique for NLP called 'Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning' (ULMFiT). The approach is as follows:\n1. Train a *language model* to predict the next word in a sentence. This step is already done for us; with [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai/) we can download a model that has been pre-trained for this task on millions of Wikipedia articles. A good language model already knows a lot about how language works in general - for  instance, given the sentence 'Tokyo is the capital of', the model might predict 'Japan' as the next word. In this case the model understands that Tokyo is closely related to Japan and that 'capital' refers to 'city' here instead of 'upper-case' or 'money'.\n2. Fine-tune the language model to a more specific task. The pre-trained language model is good at understanding Wikipedia English, but Twitter English is a bit different. We can take the information the Wikipedia model has learned and apply that to a Twitter dataset to get a Twitter language model that is good at predicting the next word in a tweet.\n3. Fine-tune a *classification model* to identify sentiment using the pre-trained language model. The idea here is that since our language model already knows a lot about Twitter English, it's not a huge leap from there to train a classifier that understands that 'love' refers to positive sentiment and 'hate' refers to negative sentiment. If we tried to train a classifier without using a pre-trained model it would have to learn the whole language from scratch first, which would be very difficult and time consuming.\n\n<img alt=\"Diagram of the ULMFiT process (source: course.fast.ai)\" width=\"700\" align=\"left\" caption=\"The ULMFiT process\" id=\"ulmfit_process\" src=https://i.imgur.com/8XLluAn.png>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This notebook will walk through steps 2 and 3 with [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai/).
