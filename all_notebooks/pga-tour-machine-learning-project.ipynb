Therefore, I decided to explore their statistics. To collect all the data, I scraped the data from the [PGA Tour website](https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html) using python libraries such as beautifulsoup. (The code for the data collection is included in the repository)\n\nFrom this data, I performed an exploratory data analysis to explore the distribution of players on numerous aspects of the game, discover outliers, and further explore how the game has changed from 2010 to 2018. I also utilized numerous supervised machine learning models to predict a golfer's earnings and wins. \n\nTo predict the golfer's win, I used multiple classification methods such as logisitic regression, SVM (Support Vector Machines), and Random Forest Classification. I found that I had the best performance with the Random Forest Classification method. To predict the golfer's earnings, I used linear regression, polynomial features with linear regression, and ridge regression.

For example, we can see that the fairway percentage and greens in regulations does not seems to contribute as much to a player's win. However, all the strokes gained statistics contribute pretty highly to wins for these players. It was interesting to see which aspects of the game that the professionals should put their time into. This also gave me the idea of track my personal golf statistics, so that I could compare it to the pros and find areas of my game that need the most improvement. \n\n### Machine Learning Model\n\nFrom this PGA Tour EDA and Machine Learning Models, I was able to examine the data of PGA Tour players, classify if a player will win that year or not, and predict their earnings. While, I believe that I can improve my prediction of their earnings, I am satisfied with my classification and regression model. With the random forest classification model, I was able to achieve an ROC AUC of 0.89 and an accuracy of 0.95 on the test set. This was a significant improvement from the ROC AUC of 0.78 and accuracy of 0.91. Because the data is skewed with approximately 80% of players not earning a win, the primary measure of the model was the ROC AUC. I was able to improve my model from ROC AUC score of 0.78 to a score of 0.89 by simply trying 3 different models, adding domain features, and polynomial features.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nHaving done a simple regression model on predicting the earnings of golfers, I would like to come back to this project again with a deeper understanding of other regression models to attempt to better predict the earnings of golfers. As shown below, the model predicted that Tiger Woods would make 1.3 million dollars in the year 2013. But in fact, Tiger Woods made 8 million dollars. Tiger Woods is one of the best players in the world is definately an outlier. However, I would like to come up with a model that can better predict the earnings of even the best players in the world. \n\nIf you made it to the end of this notebook, I hope you learned something about the PGA Tour statistics!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Tiger Woods\\' Predicted Earning: ' + \n      str(find_earning(X = poly_earning, y = target, name = 'Tiger Woods', year = 2013).values[0]))\n\n# Tiger Wood's actual earnings in 2018 \ntw13 = df.loc[(df['Player Name']=='Tiger Woods') & (df['Year']==2013), 'Money']\nprint('Tiger Woods\\' Actual Earning: ' + str(tw13.values[0]))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
