Let's see what kind of courses are offered, how popular are they, and see what features make them so. I will be making various kinds of plots to see the distribution of the variables as well as better see the relationships. \n\nJust a side note: the data is not cleaned so you will have to mess around with a lot of the columns to make the data usable. Also, the data doesn't really look complete to me (or even a random subset of the entire data) as a lot of subjects offered on Udemy are missing.\n\nAlso, there is one music and spanish song course, and the data for that is wrong. Some people have dropped it, but you can see the observation I made and how to fix it here: [https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/udemy-courses/discussion/151353].

Remember all of those outlers we saw in the number of subscribers, most of them came from the free courses. That doesn't mean, however, that even paid courses go big.

Musical instruments have a higher turnout for paid courses, but not much more. Web Development gyush can charge money and still get a decent turnout. Also, web development's free course graph is extremely skewed so it probably means that everyone wants to learn web development, but aren't dedicated enough to actually pay for the course.\n\nNow let's look at the relationship between price, number of subscribers and number of lectures..

In fact, in paid courses, the only one with high number of subscribers are the expensive ones. \n4. Expensive courses are generally longer - I guess this is kind of obvious as well.\n5. Udemy courses generally have the title: 'Learn to use {tool or topic specific to subject} from scratch'.\n\n\nI hoped you liked this notebook a lot.
