Using Twitter as a data source and the particular tweets that were scraped and used in this notebook, we can conclude that there has been an increase in conversations about Covid-19 and cancer in Canada since March 1, 2020 as indicated by the increase in the number of tweets containing words related to Covid-19 and cancer. The majority of Canadians talking about Covid-19 and cancer are from the Toronto and Vancouver areas and are of the general public. Although it is evident that the conversation has increased, this Twitter data indicates that there has been little to no change in cancer care in Canada since March 1, 2020; the majority of tweets published during this time are not related to a change in one's cancer treatment. **This doesn't mean that cancer care hasn't changed since March 1, 2020.** To further investigate how cancer care in Canada has changed since March 1, 2020, more tweets that contain different search terms can be scraped and categorized. The same activity can also be completed for other public platforms, such as Facebook and cancer support groups."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How the Tweet Summary Data was Created\nFirst tweets were scraped using twitterscraper (https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper). twitterscraper was used 168 times (4 search terms x 6 cities x 7 weeks) and a .json file containing the tweets and their meta-data were saved for each run whenever tweets that met the search criteria were available. The labelling of the type of user (\"general public\", \"news\", etc.) was done manually and required reading the usernames of each unique user. The labelling of the tweet content (\"virus concern\", \"cancer concern\", etc.) was done manually and required reading each tweet. The summary data was created for the sole purpose of categorizing the users and tweets. If you're not interested in this level of detail (or are concerned about the labelling bias that comes with this) and only want to see statistics such as number of tweets or number of unique users publishing tweets, the raw tweet (.json) files can be used instead."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
