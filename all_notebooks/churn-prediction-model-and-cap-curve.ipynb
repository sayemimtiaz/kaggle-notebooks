*SeniorCitizen*: There are much fewer senior citizens and there is a larger proportion of senior citizens churning\n- *Partner*: There seems to be an equal distribution of people having and not having partners, there is also a larger proportion of people with partners churning\n- *Dependents*: There are much fewer people with dependents, there is a larger proportion of people with no dependents churning\n- *PhoneService*: There are many more people with a phone service\n- *MultipleLines*: The numbers of people who have and do not have multiple lines are similar\n- *InternetService*: There are many more people who has an internet service and there is a large proportion of people with fiber optic internet service who intend to churn\n- *OnlineSecurity*: For those with an internet service, there are more people with no online security and a large proportion of the same group of people has churned.\n- *OnlineBackup*: For those with an internet service, there are more people with no online backup and a large proportion of the same group of people has churned\n- *DeviceProtection*: For those with an internet service, there are more people with no device protection and a large proportion of the same group of people has churned\n- *TechSupport*: For those with an internet service, there are more people with no tech support and a large proportion of the same group of people has churned\n- *StreamingTV*: There seems to be an equal distribution of people who did and did not have streaming tv with respect to churn intention\n- *StreamingMovies*: There seems to be an equal distribution of people who did and did not have streaming movies with respect to churn intention\n- *Contract*: There are many more people who are on a month-to-month contract and a large proportion of this group of people has churned\n- *PaperlessBilling*: The number of people with paperless billing is quite similar to that with\n- *PaymentMethod*: There are more people adopting electronic check as a payment method and a large proportion of them has churned\n- *Churn*: The number of churn cases is significantly fewer than that of non-churn ones\n- *tenure*: The distribution of tenure periods seems to be quite even except that for two peaks at the extreme ends\n- *MonthlyCharges*: Highest peak appears at the lower spectrum of values\n- *TotalCharges*: Distribution of values is right

useful in evaluating a churn prediction model's capability in optimal allocation of resources. The model used in this notebook has achieved decent performance by first picking 500 customers to give vouchers to as a preventive measure of churn and then successfully identifying 259 churn cases.\n\nBetter models would be able to identify many more churn cases within 500 selected customers, hence enhancing the effectiveness of the preventive measure of churn.\n\nModels' performances in reducing costs and enhancing effectiveness of preventive measures of churn can be assessed to be exceptional based on the number of churn cases identified within a fixed number of customers or the number of customers required to identify all the churn cases."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"10\"></a>\n\n- https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/telecom-customer-churn-prediction\n- https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-classifier-evaluation-using-roc-and-cap-curves-7db60fe6b716"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
