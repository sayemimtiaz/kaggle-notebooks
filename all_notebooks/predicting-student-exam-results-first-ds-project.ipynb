More recently, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, predicted grades have been used by exam boards, particularly within the UK, as a student's final grade. As a result, the accurate prediction of these grades has grown significantly more important. \n\nThe dataset used within this project was found on kaggle.com and a big thank you to Kaggle user Jakki for providing this dataset for public use. \n\nThroughout this kernel, we shall undertake the following tasks.\n\n0.

In this section we shall try to extract as much information as possible from the dataset via the creation of new columns.\n3. Data Preprocessing. In this section we will prepare the data for use within a wide range of machine learning algorithms, which shall include the identification of outliers and adjusting the format of certain data columns.\n4.

Furthermore, the math test had the highest percentage of students scoring below 50 marks, with 15% of students failing to reach this threshold. 10% and 13%, approximately, of students failed to score more than 50 marks in the reading and writing tests respectively. \n\nLet us investigate the relationship between each of the test scores, by producing a pairplot and a heatmap of the correlation between the variables.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.pairplot(df[['math score','writing score','reading score']])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(df[['math score','reading score','writing score']].corr(), annot=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that there is a clear, obvious and strong positive linear relationship between each of the three test results.

The strength of the relationship between the reading and writing tests is the most prominent, likely due to the fact that these subjects are extremely highly correlated. \n\nAs a result of the strong linear relationships between the three test results, we are able to produce an average result scored for each student across the three tests. This will enable us to create a simpler model in which we are only required to predict one value rather than 3.\n\n### 1.2 Independant v Dependant Variables\n\nIn this section, we shall analyse the effect our independant variables have on the test scores achieved by the students.\n\n#### 1.2.1 Gender\n\nWe shall now begin to analyse how the other data features within our dataset affect the marks achieved by the students, starting with gender.\n\nSince we are considering three different test scores, gender may have an effect. Typically, female students tend to enjoy reading and writing more than their male counterparts, while more males than females enjoy the subject of mathematics. Let us investigate this by producing box plots.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df['gender'] == 'male'].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df['gender'] == 'female'].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.boxplot(x='gender',y='math score',data=df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.boxplot(x='gender',y='reading score',data=df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.boxplot(x='gender',y='writing score',data=df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The three plots shown above, one for each test result, prove our hypothesis as to how gender will affect the test scores. Males, on average, scored higher than females in the maths test with a slightly narrower standard deviation, 14.5 for males in comparison to 15.5 for females. Furthermore, all males scored at least 27 marks whereas there was at least 1 female who failed to score any points in this test. \n\nIn the reading and writing tests, as predicted, females scored higher marks than males on average, by 6 and 9 marks respectively. In all three tests, we notice considerable dispersion in the range of marks achieved. Also, the box plots produced seem to highlight points which are classed as outliers. We shall investigate potential outliers in the data preprocessing section. \n\n#### 1.2.2 Test Preparation\n\nDuring the build up to taking the exams, students were able to complete a test preparation course. We expect to see that students who completed the course scored higher marks on average than those students who chosen not to complete the course. Let us see whether the completion or non completion of this course had an effect on the results of the tests.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df['test preparation course'] == 'completed'].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df['test preparation course'] == 'none'].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))\nplt.subplot(1,3,1)\nsns.boxplot(x='test preparation course', y='math score', data=df)\n\nplt.subplot(1,3,2)\nsns.boxplot(x='test preparation course', y='reading score', data=df)\n\nplt.subplot(1,3,3)\nsns.boxplot(x='test preparation course', y='writing score', data=df)\n\nplt.suptitle('How does the Test Preparation Course effect Test Scores?')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see clearly that, as anticipated, students that completed the test preparation course scored higher marks on average than those that did not. Average marks increased by 5, 7 and 10 for the maths, reading and writing tests, repsectively. We can also observe that the dispersion of marks scored was narrower in cases where the test preparation course was completed for all three tests. However, the interquartile range of the marks acheived does not change significantly as a result of the test preparation course. It appears that the preparation course solely increased the mean and median marks for each test, rather than the width of the range of marks that were scored. Despite this, it is clear that the completion of the course has a significant impact on the test results achieved by the students.\n\n#### 1.2.3 Ethnicity\n\nLet us now investigate the effect that a student's ethnicity has on the results they achieved in the three tests. We predict that race should not be an influencing factor, since all students should be treated and taught equally regardless of the ethnic backgrounds and origins.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"order = ['group A', 'group B', 'group C', 'group D', 'group E']\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,8))\nplt.subplot(1,3,1)\nsns.boxplot(x='race/ethnicity', y='math score', data=df,order=order)\n\nplt.subplot(1,3,2)\nsns.boxplot(x='race/ethnicity', y='reading score', data=df, order=order)\n\nplt.subplot(1,3,3)\nsns.boxplot(x='race/ethnicity', y='writing score', data=df,order=order)\n\nplt.suptitle('How does race/ethnicity effect Test Scores?')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Surprisingly, it appears that the race/ethnicity of a student affects the results they obtain. For the maths test in particular, we can see a steady increase in the average score as we work our way through the groups.

Let us investigate how many students belong to each ethnic group.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(x='race/ethnicity',data=df, order=order)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that group C is the most common ethnic group within this dataset and we also notice that students within this group achieve scores relatively close to the average scores achieved across the entire dataset. Group E students achieve the highest marks on average. The minority group within this dataset, group A, achieve the lowest scores on average across all 3 tests, which may hint at possible discrimation or neglection of students within this ethnic group. \n\nSince ethnicity and race does seem to have an impact on test results, we shall consider using this variable with our models that we shall use to predict students' results. The current string format of this variable is unusable for machine learning algorithms. As a result, in the data preprocessing section, we shall alter the format of the variable so that we can use it within our models.\n\n#### 1.2.4 Parental Education\n\nLet us now begin to investigate the effects that a parents' level of education has on their children's test scores. As a prediction, we anticipate that the higher the level of parental education, the higher results achieved by the students, since it is common to believe that intelligence is inherited and passed on from generation to generation.\n\nWe shall first consider the differing levels of parental education we have within this dataset.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nsns.countplot(x='parental level of education',data=df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Firstly, it is important to note that we contain two values that are extremely similar, namely \"high school\" and \"some high school\".

This more significant increase may be due to the fact that master's degrees commonly contain lots of high level report writing and as a result a child may be exposed more naturally to advanced writing techniques and a more expansive vocabulary range. \n\nAs with the race/ethnicity consideration above, since we have concluded that parental education has a notable impact on the test scores achieved, we will need to adjust the format of the variables so that they can be used within our machine learning algorithms. This will be done within the data preprocessing section. \n\n#### 1.2.5 Lunch\n\nFrom the data contained within our dataset, we can see that some students are provided with a free or reduced lunch. Let us investigate whether or not this has an influence on the test scores achieved.

Once again, this variable been shown to be an important factor on determining the results obtained by the students and, as a result, the variable will need formatting and adjusting for use within our machine learning algorithms. This will be done within the data preprocessing section. \n\nThroughout this section, we have seen that all independant variables have a significant effect on students' test scores. As a result, all columns and information within the dataset shall be used within our machine learning algorithms. \n\n## 1.3 How do our independant variables relate to each other?\n\nIn this section, we shall look at the relationship between our independant variables. Although not strictly necessary for completing our goal of predicting students exam results, this section will enable us to throughly understand our dataset and may provide useful information about the reasons behind why our variables impact the test scores in the way they do.\n\n### 1.3.1 Race/Ethnicity vs Parental Level of Education\n\nIt is extremely commonplace that people belonging to minority ethnic groups are unable to access higher levels of education, either through lack of funding or lack of opportunity. As a result, it is interesting to see whether this is the case within our dataset.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"race_v_pared = df.groupby(['parental level of education','race/ethnicity']).size().reset_index(name=\"Count\").pivot(index='parental level of education',columns='race/ethnicity',values='Count')\nrace_v_pared.index = pd.CategoricalIndex(race_v_pared.index, categories=[\"high school\", \"some college\", \"associate's degree\", \"bachelor's degree\", \"master's degree\"])\nrace_v_pared.sort_index(level=0, inplace=True)\nsns.heatmap(race_v_pared,annot=True,fmt='d')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"for group in ['group A', 'group B', 'group C', 'group D', 'group E']:\n    print(group)\n    for edu in education_order:\n        print(\"Percentage with {} education: {}%\".format(edu, 100 * race_v_pared[group][edu]/race_v_pared[group].sum()))\n    print('-' * 25)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that in the minority group, group A, nearly 50% of students' parents' only went to high school and never went on to college or university.

Data Preprocessing\n\nIn this section, we shall process our data so that it is ready for use within our machine learning algorithms.
