As part of the innate immune defense, the nasal mucosa includes receptors for the identification of pathogenic structures of microorganisms, fungi and viruses. \n\nFurther mechanisms are chemical components such as antimicrobial peptides and cellular components such as neutrophil granulocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Although pathogens can be distinguished from non-pathogens, innate immunity is relatively unspecific compared to the adaptive immune response. The recognition of pathogens is achieved by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) on the mucosal surface, which were first described by Charles Janeway Jr. PRRs can be divided into three large subunits, namely the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs).\n\nNLRs (NOD-like receptors) are intracellular PRRs that induce an immune response after the detection of PAMPs(Pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).
