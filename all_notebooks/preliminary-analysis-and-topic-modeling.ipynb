While the outcome of the majority vote of the nine justices is the sole determinant of the case at hand, the written majority opinion – typically a substantial, multi-page document – determines the scope of and the justification for the precedent that the immediate ruling establishes.  So while the case-deciding power of the court rests with the rulings, the broader precedent-setting power of the court lies in the written opinions.  These precedents can shape the direction of litigation, legislation, and in particular future rulings at all levels of courts.\n\nGiven this context, exploratory analysis of this dataset should be both interesting and useful.  In this notebook, I'll examine about 7,500 opinions written by eighteen different justices between 1970 and 2016.  I'll perform the following types of analysis:\n- high-level statistical analysis of justices and opinion counts/lengths/types over the years\n- topic modeling of opinions\n- clustering opinions\n- quantitative and qualitative comparisons between different justices' work\n- correlations with known ideological tendencies\n\nI'll also make an attempt at classifying opinions by author.  However, note that there are numerous difficulties that will make this a very difficult task:\n- topics of opinions vary hugely based on the subject matter of the case\n- the official authoring justice is not the sole author of any opinion: opinions are typically first drafted by clerks, and revised through discussion and collaboration with other justices\n- the problem features a moderately high number of classes (18) with limited examples (minimum ~100)\n\nThat said, most of the interesting insights here will come from the unsupervised exploration of the data.\n\nFinally, two quick notes on adapting this notebook into a Kaggle kernel.  First, this notebook originally included a section on moral and political ideology, but because it used outside data sources (Martin-Quinn scores, Segal-Cover scores, Moral Foundations Theory keywords dictionary), so there's no straightforward way to run it in a Kaggle kernel.  Second, at time of posting, Kaggle's seaborn module is a version behind and doesn't include the scatterplot module used for the clustering plots here; it has to be manually updated per [Kaggle's instructions.](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/kernels#modifying-the-default-environment)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0aa11025aa03a63d160d08fa26eff2e7461b5bfb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"b19332eb9850cf1ba93a6066e6996dbc6b907e7c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy as sp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set()\nfrom time import time\nimport random\nrandom.seed(11)\n\n# suppress warnings: only necessary on Kaggle kernel (because of some spotty package updates)\n# shouldn't be necessary on a properly updated local machine\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=UserWarning)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3759dea7cd3f90b6c416d58ad637ffd9c4eb9389"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load and Clean\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"aaebdda13b36d380aa0d1e18af4cf005bf68b883"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"8869a4b07774507955eaafa6eebfbe20f3b2a0a3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"opinions_df = pd.read_csv('../input/opinions_since_1970.csv')\n\n# eliminate a few hundred mini-opinions that are basically short comments on the majority opinion\nopinions_df = opinions_df[opinions_df.text.map(lambda x: len(x) > 3000)]\nprint(opinions_df.shape)\n\n# eliminate lingering per curiam opinions; eliminate the second_dissenting / dissenting distinction\nopinions_df = opinions_df[opinions_df.category != 'per_curiam']\nopinions_df.category = opinions_df.category.map(lambda x: x if x != 'second_dissenting' else 'dissenting')\n\n# drop least common authors (Roberts, Kagan, Black, Harlan)\nauthors_with_min_100 = opinions_df.author_name.value_counts()[opinions_df.author_name.value_counts() > 100].index\nopinions_df = opinions_df[opinions_df.author_name.isin(authors_with_min_100)]\n\n# drop justice douglas (213 opinions) for reasons detailed below\nopinions_df = opinions_df[opinions_df.author_name!='justice douglas']\n\nopinions_df.author_name.value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8711ca7c904259c88d94c5148f7ff18a6f41ddb4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A note on dropping Justice Douglas\n\nDespite the fact that me meets the minimum opinion count, we're going to drop Justice Douglas from the dataset.  There are three core reasons:\n1. He doesn't really belong to the era this report is examining.  We are examining 1970-2016; Douglas was incapacitated in 1974 and retired in 1975.\n2. The meta-statistics of his opinions are quite anomalous. He wrote far shorter opinions, far more opinions per year, and nearly exclusively in dissent.\n3. The opinions he wrote were themselves highly unusual. \n\nThe last point requires some substantiation, and is in fact a major understatement.  Per Wikipedia: \n\n<blockquote>\"In general, legal scholars have noted that Douglas's judicial style was unusual in that he did not attempt to elaborate justifications for his judicial positions on the basis of text, history, or precedent. Douglas was known for writing short, pithy opinions which relied on philosophical insights, observations about current politics, and literature, as much as more conventional \"judicial\" sources. Douglas wrote many of his opinions in twenty minutes, often publishing the first draft.\"</blockquote>\n\nAll of the plots below marked Douglas as a major outlier when included, which is good intuitive confirmation of their usefulness.  Even better, the LSA dataset formulated later in this notebook uniquely identified him as unusual.  His outliership is so extreme that it washes out differences and trends among other justices.  For these reasons, we'll drop Douglas from the dataset moving forward."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ae5877950d33101594865f779acfe605f0c2ca06"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Basic data exploration\n\nOur opinions data now contains 7,578 opinions from 1970 through 2018.

For one thing, choosing the right number of components is highly empirical.  It's generally possible to use some heuristics based on the rate of change in the perplexity of the results (the RPC*); however, the perplexity metric built into sklearn's LDA is broken, and constructing my own isn't a priority for this capstone.  From empirical investigation of the resulting topical clusters over repeated runs, the topics seemed to be distinct and useful at low numbers (5-8), poor at small/medium numbers (10-20), and fairly well again and medium/large numbers (30-50).  I also tried tweaking the alpha and beta parameters, but the default values seemed to work best.\n\nLDA is also not especially stable between runs.  I've set the random state for the sake of consistency, but different runs did produce somewhat different groupings and results, although this variance was curtailed by increasing the max_iter parameter.  \n\nThe wordclouds here, as before, scale the words by the weight allotted to each of the 30 top-weighted terms in the LDA vector.

As the number of topics increases, the specificity increases but the consistency of coherence falls. Nevertheless, the 40-50% of the clusters that don't display any clear human-conceptual coherence may still represent significant semantic groupings not captured by our English vocabulary and concept-structures, or just not readily apparent.  \n\nIt is also possible as an optimization to filter out the top words selected by the first LSA feature, and then run LDA on the remaining datase, as in the commented-out code snippet below.  In practice, I didn't find that this made any noticeable improvement in topic distinctness or coherence.\n\nIt's worth noting that different runs of LDA with different settings produced results that differed in interesting ways.  It would be far too space-consuming to print out the results of every variant, but I'll mention a few of the differences here.  \n\nFirst, with 10-15 clusters, some runs grouped abortion with medical issues as in the groupings above, but others grouped it with fourth amendment rights and search legality.  That isn't the first connection most humans would think of, but it represents the fact that abortion has been treated in the courts as a right to privacy issue.  Such a grouping shows that the algorithm is drawing semantic clusters from how these topics are actually treated in the text, not just general language-use patterns.\n\nSecond, while almost every run of LDA included a topic cluster for criminal cases or sentencing and some version of finance and bankruptcy cases, the set of topic clusters varied widely.  Native American cases, religion, obscenity, segregation, immigration law, and maritime law all appeared in some runs and not others.  This demonstrates that the hyperparameters of LDA matter a great deal, and that it can be pretty unstable across different runs if max_iter is set fairly low.  But it also represents legitimate conceptual ambiguities.  Ten humans would almost certainly come up with ten different ways for enumerating and grouping the topics encompassed by these six thousand opinions. Is abortion a medical issue or a right to privacy issue, legally speaking?  Should trade be grouped with maritime law, or with immigration?  In a way, it's actually more reaffirming than otherwise that runs of LDA can differ on some of the same issues that humans may reasonably differ on."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"adf3a82de8fcd78a72443b7baf27412929761606"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# # LSA-filtered LDA:\n# components_df = pd.DataFrame(svd.components_[:2,:], columns=vectorizer.vocabulary)\n# filtered_words = components_df.loc[0].sort_values(ascending=False)[:25].index\n# print(filtered_words)\n\n# vectorizer_3 = TfidfVectorizer(\n#     lowercase=True,\n#     use_idf=True,\n#     vocabulary=[word for word in common_words if word not in filtered_words]\n# )\n# tfidf_mat_3 = vectorizer_3.fit_transform(joined_opinions)\n\n# lda_20 = LatentDirichletAllocation(\n#     n_components=20,\n#     max_iter=20,\n#     random_state=11\n# )\n# lda_mat = lda_20.fit_transform(tfidf_mat_3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"20bc8475c8521b79493fae2c1ce1abe841573ec5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Plotting topics over time"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"5b1d0047a58a4c37116828f1e9f746504b836a62"},"cell_type":"code","source":"lda_mat.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"216a5001b8e1c771f2a610dcbb2a9db648c219b5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"lda_df = pd.concat(\n    [\n        op_df[['author_name','year_filed','case_name', 'category', 'word_count']].reset_index(drop=True), \n        pd.DataFrame(lda_mat)\n    ],\n    axis=1)\n\nlda_by_year = lda_df[['year_filed'] + list(range(30))].groupby('year_filed').agg('mean')\nlda_by_year.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"35111db4975540092edbc9fb4d0dfb8567b1cba3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = lda_by_year.index[1:-1]\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,10))\n\nfor feature in [14,22,23]:\n    y_vals = list(lda_by_year[feature-1])\n    y = [(y_vals[j] + y_vals[j-1] + y_vals[j+1])/3 for j in range(1, len(y_vals)-1)] # rolling mean for smoothing\n    plt.plot(x,y)\nplt.legend(labels=[\n    'religion in schools',\n    'unions and employers',\n    'immigration'\n])  \nplt.title(\"Topic prominence in SCOTUS opinions over time\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ab0cdd9d8437561f6e37299f5b17524546c353d8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There's a lot of noise here because there are many factors affecting which cases reach the Supreme Court each year.

large, adding cluster labels doesn't actually help at all.  The Spectral clustering labels did help a little bit with the SVM, but they either didn't change or slightly lowered the other model scores.  It's a little bit surprising that none of the more advanced topical analysis seems to have helped at all.\n\nThe most accurate model here, seems to be Random Forest, topping out at around 37%.  For text classification in general, it's surprising that RF would be better than the canonical linear SVM (our second most accurate model here, at 31%).  However, it's easy to see why it might be more effective given the particulars of this data.  The data has a latent hierarchical structure, with authorship falling well below subject/topic of the case.  The hierarchical structure of Random Forest allows it to account for this hierarchical structure in the data.\n\nThat said, all of these models are massively overfitting.  There may be parameter tweaking that could improve this.  But it also means that our core problem here is probably the limited data.  If we had ten times the data, we could probably predict authorship pretty accurately – but there's a very finite number of opinions authored by each SCOTUS justice.\n\nOverall, due to the various intrinsic difficulties of the dataset, our prediction rate will probably remain fairly low no matter what we try."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0ae9b5cc723cab48a6979ead78a3d5f527f48fff"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Checking clustering on test set\n\nHere we'll return to the test data set aside earlier and see if the methods produce comparable results."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7b15aeaee10742b71777e1475c6acaf2f294f5a3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### LSA"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"28bb621d035dd72a3e9eb2d1ea5ed32cfad0f504"},"cell_type":"code","source":"joined_opinions_test = [\n    ' '.join([lemma for lemma in opinion]) # could remove with `if lemma in common_words`, but vectorizer vocab does so\n    for opinion in lemmatized_opinions_nonames_test]\ntfidf_mat_test = vectorizer_2.transform(joined_opinions_test)\n\nstart=time()\nlsa_mat_test_300 = svd.transform(tfidf_mat_test)\nlsa_mat_test_200 = lsa_mat_test_300[:,:200]\nlsa_mat_test_100 = lsa_mat_test_300[:,:100]\nprint('Total LSA time:', round((time()-start)/60, 1), 'minutes')\nprint('lsa_mat shape:', lsa_mat_test_200.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"6e960bac4a9f03e4b6f93f94892bb47a27bfb911"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# TSNE\ntsne = TSNE(random_state=12)\nstart = time()\ntsne_mat_test = tsne.fit_transform(lsa_mat_test_300[:,:65])\ntsne_test_df = pd.concat(\n    [test_df[['author_name','category','case_name','year_filed']].reset_index(drop=True), \n     pd.DataFrame(tsne_mat_test)], \n    axis=1\n) \nprint(\"Elapsed time:\", round((time()-start)/60, 1), \"minutes\")\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\nsns.scatterplot(tsne_test_df[0], tsne_test_df[1], s=25, hue=tsne_test_df.author_name)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"ce4d6669c36667391d7a8dc4c883ab577e964036"},"cell_type":"code","source":"tfidf_df_test = pd.DataFrame(tfidf_mat_test.todense(), columns=vectorizer_2.vocabulary) # tfidf_mat must be the 400: version\n\ndef labels_to_keywords(labels, tfidf_df, n=2):\n    label_dict = {}\n    for label in np.unique(labels):\n        label_dict[label] = list(tfidf_df[labels==label].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).index[:n+1])\n        label_dict[label] = ', '.join([word for word in label_dict[label] if word not in ['ct', 'court']][:n])\n    return [label_dict[label] for label in labels]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"baa5941ba015ff3e1c24b763790e505ed1b4f74e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=24, random_state=11)\nlabels = kmeans.fit_predict(lsa_mat_test_300)\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\nsns.scatterplot(tsne_test_df[0], tsne_test_df[1], s=25, hue=labels_to_keywords(labels, tfidf_df_test))\nplt.title('K-means clustering with k=24')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"84d7a911262ff70df5e43ebdf04c4cc79c0ca2d6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"spectral = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=22)\nlabels = spectral.fit_predict(lsa_mat_test_300)\nspectral_labels = labels[:]\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\nsns.scatterplot(tsne_test_df[0], tsne_test_df[1], s=25, hue=labels_to_keywords(labels, tfidf_df_test))\nplt.title('Spectral Clustering clustering with k=22')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9d269fc7517e34a9c113fe6bd17443c983c02957"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Clustering check conclusions:\n\nAll of these results are affirmative.

The topical clusters produced by clustering seem to be the most coherent (even more than the topics from LDA), probably because the topic/subject is the most prominent or determinative latent aspect of any given opinion.  The supervised task of predicting authorship remains extremely difficult, however, due to the diverse topics covered, the formulaic nature of the prose, and the collaborative methods by which the texts were generated.\n\nIn future work, topical clusters like these could easily be used for opinion classification.  Tracking political leanings within topical clusters could also prove more insightful than trying to do so across all topics.\n\n### Further work\nThere remains much to be done with this data that could not fit into this capstone project.  In particular:\n- A **more rigorous Moral Foundations Theory analysis** and certain types of **bias evaluation** using pre-trained word embeddings could lend useful insight.\n- **Sentiment analysis** using pre-trained word embeddings may yield interesting results, especially over the course of single opinions from paragraph to paragraph\n- **Textual entailment** could be used to attempt a mapping of argumentative structures in the opinions\n- **Mapping centers of tension**: we could use custom-generated word embeddings (with word2vec, or an inverted tf-idf + LSA) to measure which words are used most differently by different authors – especially justices of different political leanings.  This could identify ideological and linguistic centers of tension, which we could map over time.\n\nOverall, this project revealed a lot of information about the opinions themselves, but pointed even more toward interesting future work that could be built on this foundation."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
