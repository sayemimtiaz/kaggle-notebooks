Sentiment analysis is an excellent way to discover how people, particularly consumers, feel about a particular topic, product, or idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe origin of sentiment analysis can be traced to the 1950s, when sentiment analysis was primarily used on written paper documents. Today, however, sentiment analysis is widely used to mine subjective information from content on the Internet, including texts, tweets, blogs, social media, news articles, reviews, and comments. This is done using a variety of different techniques, including NLP, statistics, and machine learning methods. Organizations then use the information mined to identify new opportunities and better target their message toward their target demographics. The Obama Administration used sentiment analysis to predict public response to its policy announcements.<br/>  \n## How many types of sentiment analysis are there?\nAccording to [upgrad](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/types-of-sentiment-analysis/), there are 4 types of sentiment analyses. <br/>\n### (1) Fine grained sentiment analysis:\nThis analysis gives you an understanding of the feedback you get from customers. You can get precise results in terms of the polarity of the input. However, the process to understand this can be more labor and cost-intensive as compared to other types. <br/>\n### (2) Emotion Detection Sentiment Analysis\n\nThis is a more sophisticated way of identifying the emotion in a piece of text. Lexicons and machine learning are used to determine the sentiment. Lexicons are lists of words that are either positive or negative. This makes it easier to segregate the terms according to their sentiment. The advantage of using this is that a company can also understand why a customer feels a particular way. This is more algorithm-based and might be complex to understand at first.<br/>\n\n### (3) Aspect-based analysis\n\nThis type of sentiment analysis is usually for one aspect of a service or product. For example, if a company that sells televisions uses this type of sentiment analysis, it could be for one aspect of televisions – like brightness, sound, etc. So they can understand how customers feel about specific attributes of the product. <br/>\n\n### (4) Intent analysis\n\nThis is a deeper understanding of the intention of the customer. For example, a company can predict if a customer intends to use the product or not. This means that the intention of a particular customer can be tracked, forming a pattern, and then used for marketing and advertising. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this notebook, we are going to explore different sentiment analysis procedures but we will not train any new one.
