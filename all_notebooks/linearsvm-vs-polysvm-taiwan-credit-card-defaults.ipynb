The goal is to find whether some features are irrelevant and how much they impact the accuracy of the model. This task will be performed on the same data throughout and using the polynomial of degree 3 model.\n\nThis reveals a very interesting pattern. Using even one feature we can achieve a very similar performance (even slightly better)."},{"metadata":{"id":"9BbWVmRLcoVm","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1220},"outputId":"a1f93eb9-fac2-473a-d78c-6da06ba9c178","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1561184816008,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":2548423,"user":{"displayName":"Guilherme Christmann","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hCFi5X4m8lQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAZw/vprpl1dVGp0/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"11999196591751237309"}},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"FEATURE_NAMES = [\"LIMIT_BAL\", \"SEX\", \"EDUCATION\", \"MARRIAGE\", \"AGE\", \"PAY_0\", \"PAY_2\",\n                 \"PAY_3\", \"PAY_4\", \"PAY_5\", \"PAY_6\", \"BILL_AMT1\", \"BILL_AMT2\", \"BILL_AMT3\",\n                 \"BILL_AMT4\", \"BILL_AMT5\", \"BILLT_AMT6\", \"PAY_AMT1\", \"PAY_AMT2\", \"PAY_AMT3\",\n                 \"PAY_AMT4\", \"PAY_AMT5\", \"PAY_AMT6\"]\n# Due to computing time constraints use a much smaller training dataset here\nx_train, y_train, x_test, y_test = trainTestSplit(dataset, 0.85)\n\ndef trainModel(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test):\n    svm = SVC(gamma='scale', kernel='poly', degree=3, \n              class_weight=\"balanced\")\n    svm.fit(x_train, y_train)\n    return svm.score(x_test, y_test)\n\nprint(f\"Will train on {x_train.shape[0]} samples and validate on {x_test.shape[0]} samples.\")\n# Train a baseline model for this data, including all the features\nbaseline_acc = trainModel(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test)\nprint(f\"Baseline Acc: {baseline_acc*100}%\")\nprint(\"====================================\")\n\nremaining_features = np.arange(0, x_train.shape[1])\nfor i in range(x_train.shape[1]-1):\n    feat_names = [FEATURE_NAMES[r] for r in remaining_features]\n    print(f\"Remaining features: \", end=' ')\n    [print(feat, end=', ') for feat in feat_names]\n    print()\n    \n    best_acc = 0.0\n    least_impact_feature = 0\n    # Find feature with least impact on performance\n    for c in range(remaining_features.shape[0]):\n        # Test by removing each of the columns\n        curr_features = np.delete(remaining_features, c)\n        part_x_train = x_train[:, curr_features]\n        part_x_test = x_test[:, curr_features]\n        \n        acc = trainModel(part_x_train, y_train, part_x_test, y_test)\n        if acc > best_acc:\n            best_acc = acc\n            least_impact_feature = c\n\n    print(f\"Removing feature {FEATURE_NAMES[remaining_features[least_impact_feature]]} -- Had the least impact on performance (Acc: {best_acc*100} %)\")\n    remaining_features = np.delete(remaining_features, least_impact_feature)\n    print(\"====================================\")\n    \nprint(f\"Last feature is {FEATURE_NAMES[remaining_features[0]]}\")\npart_x_train = x_train[:, remaining_features]\npart_x_test = x_test[:, remaining_features]\nacc = trainModel(part_x_train, y_train, part_x_test, y_test)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {acc*100} %\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"5UBrgvescoVr","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Clustering customers with K-Means\nHere, K-Means is used to cluster the customers based on the features, without taking in account if the default was paid next month. Then, a single cluster is chosen to be considered as the class where the default was paid and the overall accuracy is calculated. The test is repeated for different cluster sizes.\n\nWe can see that using only 2 clusters yielded the best (although not good) result. This happens probably because as we use a larger number of clusters the data becomes more partitioned, i.e. there's less samples per cluster, so the accuracy takes a drop even though the probability is \"better\" in-cluster. An interesting extension of this is exhaustively searching through all combinations of clusters to find the one that yields the best overall accuracy."},{"metadata":{"id":"e-L6ZNDycoVs","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1300},"outputId":"291a032a-85a6-4c51-b770-1defa7264d21","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1561184824310,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":2556710,"user":{"displayName":"Guilherme Christmann","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hCFi5X4m8lQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAZw/vprpl1dVGp0/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"11999196591751237309"}},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get a dataset split for clustering and validation\nx_train, y_train, x_test, y_test = trainTestSplit(dataset, 0.2)    \n\nn_clusters = [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]\nfor n in n_clusters:\n    print(f\"K-Means with {n} clusters:\")\n    # Create K-Means model\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n)\n    kmeans.fit(x_train) # Fit to training data\n    # Get clusters from validation data\n    clustered = kmeans.predict(x_test)\n    # For each cluster, find the probability defaulting (that the client paid it next month)\n    # by comparing the number of samples for each class\n    highest_prob = 0.0\n    highest_c = 0\n    overall_acc = 0.0\n    for c in range(n):\n        # Retrieve samples that belong to the current cluster\n        indices = np.where(clustered == c)[0]\n        samples_in_cluster = [y_test[s] for s in indices]\n        # How many of those samples are of customers with default paid next month?\n        proportion = np.bincount(samples_in_cluster)\n        prob = proportion[1] / np.sum(proportion)\n        print(f\"[Cluster {c}] - Probability of paid credit in this cluster: {prob*100} %\")\n        if prob > highest_prob:\n            highest_c = c\n            highest_prob = prob\n            overall_acc = proportion[1] / y_test.shape[0]\n    \n    print(f\"Choosing the single cluster {highest_c} as default_paid yields an overall Accuracy of {overall_acc*100} %\")\n    \n    print()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Machine Learning Assignment 2 - Taiwan Credit Card Defaults.ipynb","version":"0.3.2","provenance":[]},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.7"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
