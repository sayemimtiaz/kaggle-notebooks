Here, in the “wild world of python”~(the most friendly of all languages)~, you have to consider three questions:\n\n  1. Where is going to be shown my work: App, blog, paper, or website?\n  2. How much “visual space” will I have?\n  3. Do I need/can make the plots interactable?\n\nThese questions can be tricky if you only consider one of them. Why? Well, above I will show you the results that you can have with three ways to make a dashboard; two of them need a programming language (python), and a friendly environment or IDE (jupyter notebook). The last one, Tableau, is a powerful tool for Exploratory Data Analysis and Business Intelligence but has a little negative aspect (as far as I know now).\n\nBut first, let's import all the code from the scripts. In the midtime that I get how to load my scripts, the code cells will be hidden in here. It's planned to be on scripts just to separate the main ideas and how you can use each library.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Simple data filters function","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\ndef count_if(array, value):\n    count = 0\n    for element in array:\n        if element == value:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef array_count(elements_to_count, original_array):\n    count_array = [None] * len(elements_to_count)\n    c = 0\n\n    for value in range(len(elements_to_count)):\n        count_array[c] = original_array.count(elements_to_count[value])\n        c += 1\n        \n    return count_array\n\ndef reverse(array):\n    reversed_array = [None]*len(array)\n    n = 0\n    for data in reversed(array):\n        reversed_array[n] = data\n        n += 1\n\n    return reversed_array\n\ndef rank_set_list(df, rank, info, set_list=True, array=True):\n    ranking = df[df['Rank'] == rank]\n    raw_info_in_rank = ranking[info].to_list()\n\n    if set_list == True:\n        set_info = list(set(raw_info_in_rank))\n        none_cases = count_if(set_info, None)\n        if none_cases > 0:\n            set_info.remove(None)\n\n        if array == True:\n            return set_info, raw_info_in_rank\n\n        else: return set_info\n    \n    else: return raw_info_in_rank\n\ndef rank_info(df, rank, column_info, info_name='Albums'):\n    set_info, raw_info_in_rank = rank_set_list(df, rank, column_info)\n    info_count = array_count(elements_to_count=set_info, original_array=raw_info_in_rank)\n    info = {info_name: set_info,\n            'Counts' : info_count}\n    df_info = pd.DataFrame(info)\n    df_info = df_info.sort_values(by=['Counts'])\n\n    return df_info","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"file_dir = '../input/amazon-mexico-top-50-best-sellers/mexico/parquet/mx-music.parquet'","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Matplotlib code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Personal Build\n# from graph.data_filters import *\n\n# Kernel Graphics\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import dates as mdates\nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches\n\n# Data Management\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef plot_rank_barh(x, y, rank):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\n    plt.barh(y=y, width=x)\n\n    for i, v in enumerate(x):\n        plt.text(v+1, i, str(v), fontweight='bold')\n\n    xlabel = f'Times shown at #{rank} position' \n    plt.xlabel(xlabel)\n\n    header = f'Times an album hit the #{rank} position' \n    plt.title(label=header)\n\n    plt.show()\n\ndf = pd.read_parquet(file_dir)\n\ndef barh_and_scatters(pivot_column, df_info=df, top_rank=5, extracted_info_name='Albums', n_plots=1):\n\n    top = top_rank + 1 \n    info = pivot_column\n    df = df_info\n\n    for rank in range(1, top):\n        \n        #Extract Info\n        \n        extracted_df = rank_info(df, rank, info, extracted_info_name)\n        albums = extracted_df[extracted_info_name].to_list()\n        info_count = extracted_df['Counts'].to_list()\n\n        #Plot\n        plot_rank_barh(info_count, albums, rank)\n\n        #

Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts.\nPlotly.py is free and open source and you can view the source, report issues, or contribute on GitHub.\n\nTaking advantage of the interactive graphs, you can take a bunch of them, put them together on a dashboard and look at the data they have. If you haven’t tried one, try these bullets:>\n - Point the bar of an artist and look at the times he/she/they hit the first position.\n - Double click on that artist/band's name on a line plot, look at its history.\n - Look upon the box plot (second row) and look at their average position. Yes, this can be interpreted as \"La Oreja de Van Gogh\"  has the best median (half of its data) ranking of all, the second place. Can you tell the artists that have a median of 4th position?\n - What is the difference between the median price of the top 1 versus the top 5?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"artist = 'Authors/Company'\nplotly_dashboard(artist, rank=1, extracted_info_name=\"Artist/Band\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thanks for reach here! The best comes here. You can imagine the hours that took me to learn how to code these graphs just by checking my old code on the _music graphs notebook.ipynb_. But what would you think that you can take minutes building them? And even better! Without a notebook! Just on a web page! Like a blog! Well, not quite that.\n\nTableau is a powerful software developed to build this great interactive dashboard for big amounts of data. You can share your dashboards with others and make them public [here.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/edward5144#!/vizhome/AmazonBestSellers_16116180017330/AmazonMexicoTop50BestSellersMusic) Keep in mind that Tableau is build for Business Intelligence and not quite fits whit analysis like the made here. The main reason of saying this, is that in the data filters I made a special buildin function that filters the artists that reach a rank between 1 and the selected one. This implays to make a query for every request, that means duplicating the data. So in the Tableau page that you will see, you will watch all the 50 rank positions at once.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nData Visualization is an interesting way of doing Exploratory Data Analysis. Yes, you have just read an EDA of Amazon Mexico Music board. The first aspects that we have to consider are the media where we are going to communicate, define our visual space and make readable our dashboards for the audience.\n\nHope this works as a beginning to your journey in the Data Analysis world!","metadata":{}}]}
