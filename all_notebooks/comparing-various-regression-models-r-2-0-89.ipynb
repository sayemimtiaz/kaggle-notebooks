We will also explore the usage of different base estimators with Bagging. Finally, we will tune hyperparameters for Bagging and XGBoost.\n\nWe will focus only on models, since there are already many great kernels that explore data analysis and feature selection. The only feature transformation that will be performed is transforming categorical features into one-hot encoding, which will help some of the models.\n\nThe models that will be compared are:\n* Linear Regression w/ Ridge Regularization\n* Linear Regression** w/ Lasso Regularization\n* Polynomial Regression w/ Ridge Regularization\n* k-NN\n* Bagging w/ Decision Trees\n* Random Forests\n* Extremely Randomized Trees\n* AdaBoost w/ Decision Stumps\n* Gradient Boosting\n* XGBoost\n\nWe will then look at using the following base estimators with Bagging:\n* Support Vector Regression\n* Polynomial Regression w/ Ridge Reguilarization\n* k-NN\n* Decision Trees\n\nShort descriptions of the models are provided, but if you are already familiar with them they can be ignored.\n\nIf you find this notebook useful, please don't forget to <b><font color=\"blue\">like it</font></b>! *P.S.: This is my very first notebook and I do not have extensive experience with ML, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated :)*","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setup\n\nWe start by importing the necessary libraries and classes","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, KFold, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import BaggingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVR\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom xgboost import XGBRegressor\nfrom scipy.stats import geom, uniform\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dataset\n\nLet's import the dataset","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/housesalesprediction/kc_house_data.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Get our raw training samples","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"raw_X = df.loc[:,'bedrooms':]\nraw_X.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And transform some of the categorical features into one-hot encoding","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = raw_X.copy()\nfor col in ['waterfront', 'view', 'condition', 'grade']:\n    one_hot = pd.get_dummies(X[col], prefix=col)\n    X = X.drop(col, axis=1)\n    X = X.join(one_hot)\nX.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finally, let's get our target outputs","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = df['price']\ny.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup\n\nWe create our CV folds, and a helper method to print the mean R^2 score from CV.

AdaBoost does that by iteratively training models while prioritizing samples that were misclassified in previous iterations. In the context of regression, \"misclassification\" becomes how far away a prediction was from the true output value. The final estimator is a weighted sum of the weak learners, weighted by how well each performs.\n\nLike in Bagging, Decision Trees are a common choice for the underlying base estimators.
