Not all categorical variables have a clear ordering in the values, but we refer to those that do as ordinal variables. For tree-based models (like decision trees and random forests), you can expect label encoding to work well with ordinal variables.\n\n### One-hot encoding \n- One-hot encoding creates new columns indicating the presence (or absence) of each possible value in the original data. To understand this, we'll work through an example.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TW5m0aJ.png)\n- In the original dataset, \"Color\" is a categorical variable with three categories: \"Red\", \"Yellow\", and \"Green\". The corresponding one-hot encoding contains one column for each possible value, and one row for each row in the original dataset. Wherever the original value was \"Red\", we put a 1 in the \"Red\" column; if the original value was \"Yellow\", we put a 1 in the \"Yellow\" column, and so on.\n\n- In contrast to label encoding, one-hot encoding does not assume an ordering of the categories. Thus, you can expect this approach to work particularly well if there is no clear ordering in the categorical data (e.g., \"Red\" is neither more nor less than \"Yellow\"). We refer to categorical variables without an intrinsic ranking as nominal variables.\n\n- One-hot encoding generally does not perform well if the categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e., you generally won't use it for variables taking more than 15 different values)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Changing categorical values to numeric\ndf2 = df.copy()\n#sex\nle = LabelEncoder()\nle.fit(df2.sex.drop_duplicates()) \ndf2.sex = le.transform(df2.sex)\n# smoker or not\nle.fit(df2.smoker.drop_duplicates()) \ndf2.smoker = le.transform(df2.smoker)\n#region\nle.fit(df2.region.drop_duplicates()) \ndf2.region = le.transform(df2.region)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Measuring correlation\nGiven that some variables here are categorical data, we will need to use 1-way ANOVA test to calculate correlation.\n\nWe will be using 95% confidence interval (95% chance that the confidence interval you calculated contains the true population mean).\nThe null hypothesis is that they are independent.\nThe alternative hypothesis is that they are correlated in some way."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df2.corr()['charges'])\n\nlm = ols('sex ~ charges', data = df2).fit()\ntable = sm.stats.anova_lm(lm)\nprint(\"P-value for 1-way ANOVA test between sex and charges is: \",table.loc['charges','PR(>F)'])\nlm1 = ols('smoker ~ charges', data = df2).fit()\ntable1 = sm.stats.anova_lm(lm1)\nprint(\"P-value for 1-way ANOVA test between smoker and charges is: \",table1.loc['charges','PR(>F)'])\nlm2 = ols('region ~ charges', data = df2).fit()\ntable2 = sm.stats.anova_lm(lm2)\nprint(\"P-value for 1-way ANOVA test between region and charges is: \",table2.loc['charges','PR(>F)'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Here, you can see me perform a Pearson correlation test and a 1-way ANOVA test. 1-way AVOVA test is the right way to test correlation between a categorical and numerical data.\n- It seems that the smoker variable is highly correlated to charges.
