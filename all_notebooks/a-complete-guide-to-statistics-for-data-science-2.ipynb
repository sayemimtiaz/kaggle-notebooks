By taking same example from previous example of Alkaline level in water. Using the Descriptive Statistics Analysis Technique, we will measure the minimum, maximum and average level of alkaline in water bodies like lake, well, ponds, ground water pump or river. \n\nAlso presenting the collected information graphically we could get the overall information about the level of alkaline in water."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Understanding Descriptive Analysis:\n\nWhen we try to represent data in the form of graphs, like histograms, line plots, etc. the data is represented based on some kind of central tendency. Central tendency measures like, mean, median, or measures of the spread, etc are used for statistical analysis. To better understand Statistics lets discuss the different measures in Statistics with the help of an example.\n\nHere is a sample data set of cars containing the variables:\n\n* Cars\n* Mileage per Gallon (mpg)\n* Cylinder Type (cyl)\n* Displacement (disp)\n* Horse Power (hp)\n* Real Axle Ratio (drat).\n\nBefore we move any further, let’s define the main Measures of the Center or Measures of Central tendency."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Measures Of The Center:\n\nA measure of central tendency (measure of center) is a value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position of the data set (as representative of a \"typical\" value in the set). We are familiar with measures of central tendency called the mean, median and mode.\n\nThose Three Measure of the Center are as follows:\n\n1. Mean: Measure of average of all the values in a sample is called Mean.\n2. Median: Measure of the central value of the sample set is called Median.\n3. Mode: The value most recurrent in the sample set is known as Mode."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Using descriptive Analysis, you can analyse each of the variables in the sample data set for mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum.\n\n* If we want to find out the mean or average of Alkaline level in water we will check and calculate the     average of all values. In this case, we’ll take the sum of the Alkaline level from various water bodies   for particular region or take average of all region for particular water bodies like, well or lake,       river etc.\n\n**Mean**  60+79+49+45+59+55+50+77+57+39+32+65/12 = 55.5833\n\n* If we want to find out the center value of Alkaline level datasets, we will arrange the alkaline level   values in ascending or descending order and choose the middle value. In this case, we have 8 values       which is an even entry. Hence we must take the average of the two middle values. \n\nAlkaline level if water dataset : 21,21,21.3,22.8,23,23,23,23\n\n**Median** : (22.8+23 )/2 = 22.9\n\n* If we want to find out most common number of Burger eaten on Retaurent we will check the Burger name     which is repeated nost mumber of times. Here we can see that the Burger come in two values, 4 and 6.     Take a look at the data set, you can see that the most recurring value is 6. Hence 6 is our **Mode**."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Measures of the Spread:\n\nMeasures of spread describe how similar or varied the set of observed values are for a particular variable (data item). Measures of spread include the range, quartiles and the interquartile range, variance and standard deviation. And they are as follows:\n\n* **Range**: It is the given measure of how spread apart the values in a data set are.\n\n$$range = x__max - x__min$$\n\n* **Inter Quartile Range (IQR)**: It is the measure of variability, based on dividing a data set into quartiles.\n\n$$Inter Quartile Range (IQR) = Q_3 - Q_1$$\n\n* **Variance**: It describes how much a random variable differs from its expected value. It entails computing squares of deviations.\n    * **Deviation** is the difference between each element from the mean.\n    \n    * **Population Variance** is the average of squared deviations.\n    \n        $$ S^2 = \\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\bar{x})}{N} $$\n        \n    * **Sample Variance** is the average of squared differences from the mean.\n    \n        $$ S^2 = \\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\bar{x})}{n-1} $$ \n        \n* **Standard Deviation**: It is the measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.\n\n    $$ \\sigma = \\sqrt(\\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\mu)}{N}) $$\n\nNow that we’ve seen the stats and math behind Descriptive analysis, let’s try to work it out in **Python**\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Descriptive Statistics in Python\n\nIt’s always best to perform practical implementation to better understand a concept. In this section, we’ll be executing a small demo that will show you how to calculate the Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation and how to study the variables by plotting a histogram. This is quite a simple demo but it also forms the foundation that every Machine Learning algorithm is built upon."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In This Kernel we will cover Descriptive Statics topics using Python on Gap Minder Datasets.
