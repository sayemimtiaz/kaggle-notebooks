The goal of supervised learning models is to approximate a mapping function from input to ouput so that when new data is present one can predict the output for that data. Supervised learning models can be classified into two types:\n\n1. Classification : Target variable is discrete data (categorical). Examples of classification models are Neural Nets, Decision Tree. In these models one can have binary classification or multi class classification.\n\n2. Regression : Target variable is any real value. Examples of regression models are linear and polymonial regression. \n\nOn the other hand in unsupervised learning problems you only have input data X and no corresponding output data. You are training the machine on information that is neither classified nor labelled.\nUnsupervised Learning models can be classified into two types:\n\n1. Clustering : Discover inherent groupings within data. Example of a clustering algorithm is k-means\n\n2. Association : Discover rules that describe the data. Examples are Apriori algorithms for association rule learning problems.\n\nIn this tutorial we will be taking about how to build a simple neural net model."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this tutorial we are going to do binary classification and classify the wine as good if it has a quality score above a certain value and if it is below that value then we will classify it as bad wine. Binary classification can be done using logistic regression or shallow neural nets. \n\nFuture works include doing a multi calss classification to determine the quality score of the wine.\n\n# Logistic Regression\n\nLogistic Regression is used for binary classification. However it can be used for multi class classification through the one vs rest scheme in which for each class a binary classification is done. It is a one layer deep neural net having one node which is the output node. The output node assigns weights to each of the inputs and is sent as input into the sigmoid function whose output (which ranges from 0 to 1) is compared with the true label (0 or 1).\n\n# Shallow neural nets\n\nShallow neural nets consist of 1 or 2 hidden layers. Understanding shallow neural net can help us understand how deep neural nets function. They are better at approximating complex decision boundaries compared to logistic regression where a single node is present and you have only a single decision boundary so if the dataset is not linearly separable, logistic regression does not perform well and has 50/50 percent chance of predicting the correct label.

If you have only a sigmoid as the non linear activation function in the ouput then it is again a simple logistic regression problem and there is no need for any hidden leayers.\n\nReLU is a non linear activation function because it does not have a constant slope.

In such methods, each of the neural network's weights recieve an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respective to the current weight in each iteration of training Wi = Wi + learning_rate*(dJ/dWi). The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. In the worst case, this may completely stop the network from further training. For example, activation functions like tanh have gradients in the range from 0 to 1 and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule. This has the effect of multiplying 'n' of these small numbers to compute gradients of the \"front layers\" in an n-layer netowork, meaning the gradient decreses exponentially with n while the front layers train very slowly.\n\n* A problem with ReLU is that half of the space of Z is less than 0 and this can result in dead neurons with no weight update hence to overcome this problem leaky ReLU is used.

The bias vector in the lth layer has the dimensions as follows [number of hidden units in lth layer, 1]. The bias vector is broadcasted so that it can be added to WX when calculating Z.** \n\nLets see the dimensions of the derivatives\n\n* The dimensions of any Loss derivative with respect to activation must have the same dimensions of the activation marix in the corresponding layer. So for example $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[3]}} $, $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[2]}} $, $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[1]}} $ have dimensions [$n_y$, m], [$n_{h2}$, m], [$n_{h1}$, m] respectively. Let us prove this for $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[2]}} $. Looking at its formula we see that $ W^{[3]T} $ has dimensions [$n_{h2}$, $n_y$] while $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[3]}} $ has dimensions of [$n_y$, m] and $ g^{'}(Z^{[3]}) $ has dimensions [$n_y$, m]. $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[3]}} $ and $ g^{'}(Z^{[3]}) $ are multiplied element wise and the output undergoes dot product multiplication with $ W^{[3]T} $.\n\n* The dimensions of any Loss derivative with respect to weights must have the same dimensions of the weights matrix in the corresponding layer. So for example $ \\dfrac{dL}{dW^{[3]}} $, $ \\dfrac{dL}{dW^{[2]}} $, $ \\dfrac{dL}{dW^{[1]}} $ have dimensions [$n_y$, $n_{h2}$], [$n_{h2}$, $n_{h1}$], [$n_h1$, $n_x$] respectively. Let us prove this for $ \\dfrac{dL}{dW^{[2]}} $. Looking at its formula we see that $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[2]}} $ has dimensions [$n_{h2}$, m] and $ g^{'}(Z^{[2]} $ has dimensions [$n_{h2}$, m] and $ a^{[1]T} $ has dimensions [m, $n_{h1}$]. $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[2]}} $ and $ g^{'}(Z^{[2]} $ is multiplied element wise and the output undergoes dot product multiplication with $ a^{[1]T} $.\n\n* The dimensions of any Loss derivative with respect to bias must have the same dimensions as that of the bias vector in the corresponding layer. So for example $ \\dfrac{dL}{db^{[3]}} $, $ \\dfrac{dL}{db^{[2]}} $, $ \\dfrac{dL}{db^{[1]}} $ have dimensions [$n_y$, 1], [$n_{h2}$, 1], [$n_h1$, 1] respectively. Let us prove this for $ \\dfrac{dL}{db^{[2]}} $. Looking at its formula formula we see that $ \\dfrac{dL}{da^{[2]}} $ has dimensions [$n_{h2}$, m] and $ g^{'}(Z^{[2]} $ has dimensions [$n_{h2}$, m]. We use np.sum() function and sum it across all columns so that we get a column vector.\n\nConsider an 'n' layered neural net. When computing derivative of Loss with respect to weight $ W^{[n]} $ then you take the derivative of the activation function and multiply by input to activation whereas while taking derivative of Loss with respect to $  W^{[1]} $ then there is a compounding effect. That is why changes in weights to first layer is the slowest if sigmoid or tanh activation function is used in hidden layer giving rise to the vanishing gradient problem.\n\n****\n\n## Random initialization of weights\n\nWhen having multi layer neural net intializing all weights to 0 does not work. This can be understood by the following example. Consider a neural net with two inputs and two hidden nodes and one output. Node 1 In hidden layer has weights $ W_1^{[1]} $ [0,0] and node two in hidden layer has weights $ W_2^{[1]} $ [0,0] and b is initialized to 0 for both of them. Output node has weight $ W_1^{[2]} $ [0,0] and b is intialized to 0. The weights for the activation for node 1 is $a_1^{[1]}$ and is given by $ g(W_1^{[1]}X + b_1^{[1]}) $ similarly for $a_2^{[1]}$ it is $ g(W_2^{[1]}X + b_2^{[1]}) $. Substituting the zero weights in the activation functions we get $a_1^{[1]}$ == $a_2^{[1]}$ and $a^{[1]} = [0;0] $. From the above formula of $ \\dfrac{dL}{dW^{[1]}} $ we can see that weights in $ W^{[1]} $ will be updated the same $ W^{[1]} = W^{[1]} - \\alpha\\dfrac{dL}{dW^{[1]}} $ as they both started from same value.  Hence the two hidden units will behave as 1 hidden unit. As iterations continue both the weights of the hidden units will be updated the same. \n\nThis is solved by using $W^{[1]}$ = np.random.randn()x0.01. We multiply with 0.01 or any other small constant when using sigmoid or tanh activation function as we want the value of Z input into the activation function to be small otherwise large inputs lead to gradients close to 0 and the optimization algorithm will become slow leading to problem of vanishing gradient. However if you are not using sigmoid or tanh activation functions this is not a problem. Also if we have many deep layers the constant you choose will vary but for shallow neural nets (2 layers deep) using 0.01 is fine.\n\nHowever if Logistic Regression (no hidden layer) then can intialize all weights to 0. The first example X fed in the logistic regression will output zero but the derivatives of the Logistic Regression depend on the input X (because there's no hidden layer) which is not zero. So at the second iteration, the weights values follow X's distribution and are different from each other if X is not a constant vector.
