Multicollinearity happens when one predictor variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a high degree of accuracy. This can lead to skewed or misleading results.\n\nif two features is highly correlated then there is no point using both features.in that case, we can drop one feature. SNS heatmap gives us the correlation matrix where we can see which features are highly correlated. \n\nFrom above correlation matrix we can see that there are many features which are highly correlated. if we carefully analyse, we will find that many  features are there which having more than 0.9 correlation. so we can decide to get rid of those columns whose correlation is +-0.9 or above.There are 8 such columns:\n\n- max.length_rectangularity\n- scaled_radius_of_gyration\n- skewness_about.2\n- scatter_ratio\n- elongatedness\n- pr.axis_rectangularity\n- scaled_variance\n- scaled_variance.1\n\n### Outcome: \nAlso we observed that more than 50 % of our attributes ar highly correlated , so  what we can we do best to deal with this kind problem of Multicollinearity\n\n### Well, There are multiple ways to deal with this problem. The easiest way is to delete or eliminate one of the perfectly correlated features.  We can pick one of the tiwo highly correalated variables and drop another one. like in our case Scaled Variance & Scaled Variance.1 are having strong positive correlation , so we can pick one and drop one as they will only make our dimension redundant.\n\n### Similarly between elongatedness and pr.axis_rectangularity we can pick one as they have very strong negative correlation. This approach can be used to select the feature we want to carry forward for model analysis.

This will help our model to perfrom more realistically in production environment. \n    - If one scale the model before splitting it into train-test , there is a high chance of data leakage . By data leakage i mean that our model will be alaready influenced by test data , as it has tasted a bit of test data even before it will fit and tested on it. \n    \n    - Also once one have tried every bit of techniques of removing outliers, treating the missing value, normalizing  the data whenever required, applied the diffrent models to come up with better model based on metrics which suits more the problem statement. It is advisable to fine tune it using hyperparameter tuning techniques which tunes the model performances and also employs Cross-fold validation internally to make sure our model is ready to face production environment. \n    \n- It would be good if we also measure how other classifier model like logistic regression, decisiontree , emsemble model like randomforrestclassifier will perfrom both on original data & PCA data. It would be interesting to see the confusion matrix and various others metrics like recall score, precision score, f1-score etc. \n\n- But Since our objective was to see how PCA data set impacts the model perfromance specially on training data set , we have here achived our objective and saw that PCA is great tool to make our model perfrom better .
