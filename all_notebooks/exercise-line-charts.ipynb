Your first project focuses on the four museums pictured in the images below.\n\n![ex1_museums](https://i.imgur.com/pFYL8J1.png)\n\nYou will leverage data from the Los Angeles [Data Portal](https://data.lacity.org/) that tracks monthly visitors to each museum.  \n\n![ex1_xlsx](https://i.imgur.com/mGWYlym.png)\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nprint(\"Setup Complete\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The questions below will give you feedback on your work.
