The report covers all steps involved from data retrieval to exploration and modeling and recommendation. In conclusion, clusters were obtained using both the techniques, however, the more versatile K-Prototype algorithm provided more meaningful ones which answered some of the questions.

Day of the month, Day of the week, or Month do not help in distinct cluster formation and hence we can conclude that these variables do not seem to affect the performance of flights.\n2. For Cancelled variable, we see that there are distinct clusters when the flight is cancelled but given that we have a limited random sample, we cannot conclusively say that the cancellation of flights depends on delays.\n3. We did not find any parameter of the models which gave meaningful distinct clusters with respect to Departure delays – in all cases there was overlap between clusters.\n4. For the ActualElapsedTime variable (time between departure and arrival), there are distinct clusters being formed based on shorter vs longer flights, but it is not clear if there is a relationship with delays.\n\nIn light of these conclusions, we can recommend that K-prototype model be used with respect to\nmodelling especially where categorical variables are involved along with the numerical variables.\nHowever, further analysis and modelling is required to improve the findings and conclusively\nanswer our chosen research questions in order to derive business insights."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References\n* Alboukadel Kassambara.
