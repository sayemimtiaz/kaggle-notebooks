Countries such as the United States and Canada, despite relative lack of natural resources compared to South or Latin American countries, would experience considerably more economic growth, because their equitable initial conditions better enabled the development of institutions that could check against rent-seeking behaviour.\n\nRent-seeking is notoriously hard to quantify. Those who engage in such behaviour have an incentive to hide it. Gordon Tullock once observed that naive attempts to measure such behaviours appear to make them out to be much less costly than we would predict them to be, which throws in to question the quality of the measure. But, such behaviours should intuitively be correlated with perception of corruption in a country, which is something that is much easier to get data on thanks to the efforts of organizations such as Transparency International\n\nThe goal of this project is to gain a clearer intuition of the relation of distribution of wealth and perception of corruption through visualization. If the Sokoloff-Engerman hypothesis is true, then we would expect to find a correlation (though rigorously testing whether Sokoloff-Engerman hypothesis’s explanation for such a correlation existing is correct is beyond the scope of this project).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The Data Used Here\n\nThis project uses [this](https://www.kaggle.com/transparencyint/corruption-index) data set from Transparency International, and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/poverty-and-equity-database) data set from the World Bank.

Further, as time marches on, economic, social, and political forces will be acting to change the level of inequality in any given country. The irregularity of the observations may disguise interesting trends within a country, to take one example, or patterns that represent causal forces acting on many countries at once, to take another example.\n\nWe need some way to summarize these numbers. For the sake of argument, we will assume that there is no systematic biases effecting when a country could be observed for the sake of this data set, meaning the mean of our observations should be a good estimator of the actual mean Gini index for each country over this period.\n\nWhile of less intrinsic interest, we also will look at minimum observed Gini indexes and maximum observed Gini indexes.

Thus, a lower score is indicative of a more egalitarian economy, and a higher score is indicative of a less egalitarian. The Corruption Perception Index, however, works on the \"high score is good\" intuition. Low scorers are perceived as corrupt, high scorers are perceived as not corrupt. \n\nTherefore, given the empirical theories mentioned in the introduction about corruption and rent seeking causing inequality, we would predict there to be a *negative* relationship - which is exactly what our linear regression says we do predict. The slope (though not the intercept, obviously) is even roughly the same regardless of which representative Gini index number we use.\n\nThis is of minimum value for confirming the causal hypotheses discussed at the beginning of this report, but it is consistent with those hypotheses in such a way so as to suggest to us they are on the right track.","metadata":{}}]}
