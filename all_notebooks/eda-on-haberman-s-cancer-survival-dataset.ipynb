The last attribute corresponds to whether or not a particular patient survived for more than 5 years or died within 5 years of the surgery for breat cancer.\n\nHaberman's dataset specifies that some patients were found to have anywhere between 0 to 52 cancer positive auxillary lymph nodes. \n\nWhat this means is that having cancer cells in auxillary(under the armpit) lymph nodes means one's cancer is considered lymph node-positive. Based on TNM staging, tumor would be called either N1, N2, or N3 depending on how many lymph nodes contain cancer cells and how far away from the tumor the positive nodes are found.\n\n* N1: Positive- 1 to 3 auxillary lymph nodes have cancer cells.\n* N2: Positive- 4 to 9 auxillary lymph nodes have cancer cells.\n* N3: Positive- 10 or more auxillary lymph nodes have cancer cells.\n\nSources:\n* https://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-101/what-is-cancer/stage-and-grade/staging/?region=on\n* https://www.verywellhealth.com/lymph-node-positive-breast-cancer-429953\n\n\n***Attribute Information***\n1. age - Age of patient at the time of surgery. A numerical value\n2. year - Year in which patient had undergone the surgery. A numerical value.\n3. nodes - No.of cancer positive auxillary lymph nodes detected.
