This makes it the best place to study the effects of quarantine in slowing down the spread of Covid-19.\n\nLet's start with the exponential model:\n\n$$ C_{t_{i}} = C_{t_{o}} * e^{(K *(t_{i} - t_{o}))} $$\n\nwhere $ C_{t_{i}} $ is the number of cases at time $t_{i}$ and $K$ is the exponential growth constant.\n\nCovid-19 patients typically show symptoms 7-9 days after infection with the most extreme cases showcasing symptoms after 14 days. To study the effects of the quarantine, we will take a look at the number of cases in new york at the start of the quarantine vs the number of cases 10 days after the start of the quarantine. New York was placed under quarantine on March 20th, 2020, and thus we will be using the data from March 18th to 28th for our growth before quarantine and April 1st to 11th for after quarantine. One could increase the length and thus increase the amount of data we would have. However, this increases the chance that other societal factors can play a role and change the effects of quarantine. \n\nTo find an accurate measurement of the exponential growth constant, we borrow the subwalk algorithm from molecular dynamics. Briefly, one can imagine that rather than one continous growth measurement, we instead break it down into 9 independent one day growth measurements. We can repeat this for all of the other 2,3,...,9 day time steps. I have implemented a cheat's version of this algorithm which takes in more data, but not all of the data are independent. This effectively increases the data in our fit and increases the accuracy in our determination of the exponential growth constant. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Loading in the NYC county level data from new york times\nus_data=pd.read_csv('../input/uncover/UNCOVER/New_York_Times/covid-19-county-level-data.csv')\n\n#seperation of inital growth data in smaller sub time steps\ndef exponential_growth(panda):\n    days = len(panda.values)\n    collection = np.zeros((36,2))\n\n    k = 0\n    for i in range(days - 1): \n        inital = panda.values[i]\n        data = np.log(panda.iloc[i+1:].values/inital)\n        x = np.arange(8-i)+1\n        collection[k:k+8-i,0] = x\n        collection[k:k+8-i,1] = data\n        k += 8-i\n    return collection\n\n\n#determination of exponential growth constant and plots relative change in cases vs time\ndef New_york(county, data):\n    #takes in county name and the data set to pull it from\n    \n    growth_bq_raw_data = data[(data['county'] == county) & (data['state'] =='New York') & (data['date'] > '2020-03-18') & (data['date'] < '2020-03-28')]['cases']\n    growth_bq_exp = exponential_growth(growth_bq_raw_data)\n    growth_aq_raw_data = data[(data['county'] == county) & (data['state'] =='New York') & (data['date'] > '2020-04-01') & (data['date'] < '2020-04-11')]['cases']\n    growth_aq_exp = exponential_growth(growth_aq_raw_data)\n\n    #scipy linregress to find the optimal growth constant\n    bq = stat.linregress(growth_bq_exp[:,0],growth_bq_exp[:,1])\n    aq = stat.linregress(growth_aq_exp[:,0],growth_aq_exp[:,1])\n    \n    #plotting\n    x = np.arange(8)+1\n    plt.plot(growth_bq_exp[:,0],growth_bq_exp[:,1],'o',label = 'before quarantine (Slope: %0.3f, std: %0.3f)'%(bq.slope,bq.stderr))\n    plt.plot(x ,bq.intercept + bq.slope*x)\n    plt.plot(growth_aq_exp[:,0],growth_aq_exp[:,1],'^',label = 'after quarantine (Slope %0.3f, std: %0.3f)'%(aq.slope,aq.stderr))\n    plt.plot(x ,aq.intercept + aq.slope*x)\n    plt.xlabel(\"T (days)\")\n    plt.ylabel('$ln(C_{t_{i}}/C_{t_{o}})$')\n    plt.legend()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's take a look at the effects of quarantine in a few counties; New York City, Westchester, Rockland, and Nassau.

Here we show the importance of early intervention and how even delaying intervention responses by a single week can dramatically change number of cases. Early intervention is one of the best tools in stopping a pandemic and subsequently flatten the infection curve buying valueable time for the medical industry to catch up.\n\nOne can argue that I was too conservative in my choice of dates and the exponential growth a week before the quarantine started was significantly worse. They may be correct in that assertion, but I would also argue that when the number of cases are low, significant increases in testing and awareness play a bigger role in dramatical increase in cases. I would rather trend on the side of caution and select dates in which we can be sure that awareness and effects towards testing are at an all time high.\n\nHopefully, you have enjoyed my work, and I would love to hear about ideas to improve and change up the model. Certainly, one can make better models by using more assumptions in growth distribution and decay. However, I find it interesting how even a simple model like exponential growth can tell us a lot about the effects of quarantine and lack of quarantine.\n\nThanks for reading!","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
