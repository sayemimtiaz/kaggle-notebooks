However, with another models tuning we might get different results. Nevertheless, we observed how well decision trees work with the lowest calculation time.\n\nThe second interesting thing is that we got the same models performance with only one PCA component applied. Which means we highly reduced the computational time and also kept the results.\n\nOn the other hand, we have got only ~70% test accuracy and ~0.61 log loss.
