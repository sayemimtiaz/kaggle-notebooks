Admittedly, I wasn't there for the full ride of those 24 grueling seasons, but I was gripping my seat during every minute of those nail-biting playoffs series and the NBA Finals (a series no one thought we would win). The 4-bounce game-winning Game 7 buzzer beater (FIRST IN HISTORY!) against the 76ers will forever be a part of the collective Toronto sports culture. Those series are what got me to truly follow basketball, and 6 months later I started my journey navigating the world of machine learning, going through the motions of Coursera and tutorials. Now, a couple of months down the line, I thought about a simple prediction I could make using my newfound knowledge. The NBA MVP award instantly sprung to mind; the target value was immediately obvious: points won (and perhaps award share. As with most sports, there is a wealth of historical data available, enabling quick and efficient model creation. For the purposes of this notebook, I will be using danchyy's [MVP Votings Throughout History dataset] [1].\n![IS THIS THE DAGGER?][2]\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**_\"IS THIS THE DAGGER?\"_**\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/danchyy/nba-mvp-votings-through-history \n[2]: https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/sports/13shot4-sub/merlin_154781583_59ee5f0b-d267-40bf-a76e-7fd127c9adb1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting correlation\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nmvp_votings = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nba-mvp-votings-through-history/mvp_votings.csv\")\ntest_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nba-mvp-votings-through-history/test_data.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mvp_votings.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Who's On This List?\nComing as no surprise, the list of players included on the MVP votings list includes some of the consensus top NBA players of all time.
