In this notebook, we only want to use the sentiment property to see how each candidate expresses their feelings and also we'll see whether this is the best package for doing so.\n\\\n**Polarity** is a value between -1 and 1 that shows how positive or negative the sentiment of a sentence is. What TextBlob does is that it first identifies the words that are in its [lexicon](https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob/blob/eb08c120d364e908646731d60b4e4c6c1712ff63/textblob/en/en-sentiment.xml) and averages the polarity of all different meanings of one word and then multiplies these average with each other and gives us that number as the polarity of the whole sentence. [This is a great blog post](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/) where you can read more on how it is calculated.\n\n\nBut because polarity is a value and not a concrete label, I decided to divide the spectrum into 5 different groups and give a lable to each:\n\n0 - negative\n\n 1 - somewhat negative \n \n 2 - neutral \n \n 3 - somewhat positive \n \n 4 - positive\n \n**Subjectivity** is a factor between 0 and 1, showing how subjective a word or phrase is.\n\n(Pretty obvious! I know.)\n\nAdvantages of TextBlob: TextBlob provides you with fast and easy to use tools to analyze the overal sentiment and subjectivity of sentences and phrases in your data. But as we said it has a pretty naive approach compared to deep learning models. Let's see an example of how it may disappoint us. Take a look at the following sentence:\n\n\n***Fewer people are dying every day***\n\nAs human being we can understand that this sentence is evidently conveying a positive messege. But remember that we said TextBlob only takes into account words and phrases that are in its lexicon and then multiplies their polarity. Well it turns out that its vocabulary does not include words like \"fewer\" or \"dying\" and even after lemmatization and getting the following sentence:\n\n***Few people are die every day***\n\nyou won't be able to recognize this sentence as a positive one because again, \"die\" is not included in its vocabulary.\nSo for sentences that don't have a definite negative or positive tone and can be a little like facts, polarity doesn't do a great job, but subjectivity if the sentence is short and the tone clear, it can show good results as you can see in the table bellow. Go ahead and experiment yourself with different words and sentences to see how it performs.\n\n### more info:\nYou may say that we can change this and it is true we can do something rather different. Hopefully TextBlob provides us with a NaiveBayesClassifier that you can train on your own and then ask it to classify your text based on that labeled data.\n\nBut still even this classifier isn't our best bet as it won't help us with polarity and we have to provide a lot of data to a model that is not the best model for text classification.\nThough you can find some datasets online([like these two from IBM datasets](https://www.research.ibm.com/cgi-bin/haifa/vst/debating_ds19.pl)) that have a large lexicon with specified polarity and maybe train your naive bayes on them to improve your classification.

I'll introduce pipeline and also a trained model to again find out the best way of classifying this debate.\n1. Pipelines:\n\n**Advantages:** Pipelines are tools provided by the transformers library to help us do a wide range of tasks with our textual data with only one or two lines of code! For example by using the pipeline function and just inputing our data and the name of the task we want to perform we can simply get the result we want without worrying about constructing a model or training it. Take a look at the code below to get the intuition.\n\nYou may wonder this function performs. well, the default model that is used by the transformers pipeline for sentiment analysis is a pretrained \"distilbert-base-uncased\" model that has been trained on sst2 (movie reviews dataset). So you are actually using transfer learning and predict new sets of data based on the weights that were trained by another person or organization. \n\nYou can see a live demo of sentiment classification [here](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english). The models are very veried and you can both use them here or see the live demo of every and each one in the [Huggingface website](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=text-classification&search=roberta-large).\n\n**Disadvantages:** All these models are pretty useful and good but remember all models are not as accurate or good as their other fellows! For example if you go with the default(distill bert model which is not the most accurate or best among transformers models) you can see that it will identify some sentences like\n\n **\"The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent\"**\n\n as Negative with 0.92 percent certainty!\n\n Also, because these models were trained on a certain dataset with specified labels, you can't get anything different from what they can offer you. Like in this example if we want to have 5 labels, we won't be able to get it because the sst2 dataset was based on a dataset with 3 different labels: Negative, Neutral and Positive.\n\n Although there are a few flaws when you classify your text with distill bert, it is still a great way (I think better than polarity) for sentiment analysis as it is not simply averaging and takes into account the real meaning behind each word."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install transformers\nfrom transformers import pipeline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sentimentAnalysis = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\")\nprint(sentimentAnalysis(\"I have to say this is the coolest kernel ever\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# first dataset\nfirst_sent['pipeline_sentiment'] = first_sent.sent.apply(lambda x: sentimentAnalysis(x))\nfirst_sent['pipeline_score'] = first_sent.pipeline_sentiment.apply(lambda x:x[0]['score'])\nfirst_sent['pipeline_sentiment'] = first_sent.pipeline_sentiment.apply(lambda x:x[0]['label'])\n# second dataset\nsecond_sent['pipeline_sentiment'] = second_sent.sent.apply(lambda x: sentimentAnalysis(x))\nsecond_sent['pipeline_score'] = second_sent.pipeline_sentiment.apply(lambda x:x[0]['score'])\nsecond_sent['pipeline_sentiment'] = second_sent.pipeline_sentiment.apply(lambda x:x[0]['label'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"second_sent.head(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"display(HTML('<dev direction=\"down\" width=100% height=\"40\" behavior=\"still\" >\\\n<dev  style = \"font-size : 50px;\" behavior=\"alternate\" >\\\n<b>Optional but Cool and Accurate results with RoBERTa ;) </b></dev></dev>'))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So as I said I really wanted to get the best and most accurate results and havev 5 labeled outputs to identify different sentiments as best as I could.

You can see how I trained these models and use it to train your own models too!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"both = pd.read_csv('../input/analysis-of-trump-biden-debates/Trump_Biden_debates_sentiments.csv')\nfirst_sent = both.loc[:first.shape[0], :]\nsecond_sent = both.loc[first.shape[0]:, :]\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = make_subplots(rows=2, cols=2,\n                    specs=[[{\"rowspan\": 2}, {}]\n                            ,[None,         {}]],\n                    subplot_titles=(\"Both Debates and all sentences\",\n                                    \"First Debate individual candidates\", \n                                    \"Second Debate Debate individual candidates\"))\n\n#-------------------------------------------------- Both Debates -----------------------------------------------------#\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=first_sent['sentiment'],\n    name='First Debate',  xbins=dict(start=-1, end=5, size=1),\n    marker_color='purple', opacity=0.75),\n    row = 1, col = 1)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=second_sent['sentiment'],\n     name='Second Debate', xbins=dict(start=-1, end=5, size=1),\n    marker_color='#ba8cd7', opacity=0.75),\n    row = 1, col = 1)\n#-------------------------------------------------- First Debate -----------------------------------------------------#\n\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=first_sent[first_sent.speaker == 'Donald Trump']['sentiment'],\n    name='Trump_1',  xbins=dict(start=-1, end=5, size=1),\n    marker_color='red', opacity=0.75),\n    row = 1, col = 2)\n\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=first_sent[first_sent.speaker == 'Joe Biden']['sentiment'],\n    name='Biden_1', xbins=dict(start=-1, end=5, size=1),\n    marker_color='#3498DB', opacity=0.75),\n    row = 1, col = 2)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram( \n    x=first_sent[first_sent.speaker == 'mediator_1']['sentiment'],\n    name='mediator_1', xbins=dict(start=-1, end=5, size=1),\n    marker_color='#5D6D7E', opacity=0.75),\n    row = 1, col = 2)\n#-------------------------------------------------- Second Debate -----------------------------------------------------#\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=second_sent[second_sent.speaker == 'Donald Trump']['sentiment'],\n    name='Trump_2',  xbins=dict(start=-1, end=5, size=1),\n    marker_color='red', opacity=0.75),\n    row = 2, col = 2)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram(\n    x=second_sent[second_sent.speaker == 'Joe Biden']['sentiment'],\n     name='Biden_2', xbins=dict(start=-1, end=5, size=1),\n    marker_color='#3498DB', opacity=0.75),\n    row = 2, col = 2)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram( \n    x=second_sent[second_sent.speaker == 'mediator_2']['sentiment'],\n    name='mediator_2', xbins=dict(start=-1, end=5, size=1),\n    marker_color='#5D6D7E', opacity=0.75),\n    row = 2, col = 2)\n\n\n\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text='First Debate: Histogram of # of Sentences Each One Used Each Time',\n    yaxis_title_text='Count', \n    bargap=0.1, bargroupgap=0.1)\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well now this is something! We can see how Trump outperforms Biden when it comes to positive comments in the second debate although in the first debate they were somehow equal. Overall,I think Biden tends to use more general and neutral words in his speach whereas trump sometimes tries to show his emotions with expressive and too positive or too negative commands!\n\nAll that you read in this notebook was what I could understand from what I see from the data. I do not oppose or confirm any candidate or political group. Also I'd love to hear from you guys and see what you think from all the plots above!
