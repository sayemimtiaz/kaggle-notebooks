{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"At this moment, New York State is a global center (unfortunately) in the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 testing was deployed late in the US vs. elsewhere. However, to its credit, the NY State Department of Health is now providing good and timely data on COVID-19 testing. I'll examine some of it here, and also shows how the NY State data compares with data from the rest of the world. Feel free to make constructive suggestions on how to improve on this. (I can't figure out how to take the up to date data automatically from the NY State site. I tried but Kaggle would only read the first 1000 rows automatically, so I had to load it  manually. So if you know how to do that, I'd appreciate it--please put it in the comments below.)"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#some standard imports\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport os # accessing directory structure\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport datetime","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#what are the data files?\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# this is the NY county-by-county testing data from NY State\nny = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/New_York_State_Statewide_COVID-19_Testing.csv', delimiter=',')\nny.dataframeName = 'New_York_State_Statewide_COVID-19_Testing.csv'\n# Fix format of Test Date column\nny['Test Date']= pd.to_datetime(ny['Test Date']) \nnRow, nCol = ny.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\nny.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#I also found some county-by-county population data.

As you can see, the US is still behind some countries like Italy, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, but has made improvements in testing capabilities. Korea used to be a leader but some others have surpassed it, but likely because those countries are in such bad shape and need to conduct more tests than Korea (e.g., Italy). On the whole, though, the hard-hit counties in New York state are well ahead of the US, on a national basis (e.g., Westchester has tested over 8% of its population, while the US has tested under 1.5%). So a concern is that the rest of the US doesn't really know where it stands, having done relatively little testing compared with NY.
