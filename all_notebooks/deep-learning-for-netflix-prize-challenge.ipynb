{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nIn this notebook, I am going to build a recommendation system using deep learning trained on dataset of the famous Netflix Challenge competition.\n\nThe Netflix Challenge was an open competition to find the best collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for movies.\nThis challenge would be very useful for any practical application of predicting user's future rating and product's recommendation.\n\nThe dataset consists of ratings for 17,770 movies by 2,649,430 users. The challenge's goal is to develop a system that could beat the RMSE accuracy of 0.9514 from their in-house developed recommendation system (the Cinematch) by 10%. In 2009, the prize was awarded to team ”BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos” with RMSE of 0.8567 or 10.06% improvement. However, most of winning solutions at that time was (too) complex and hard to be put into production.\n\nMoreover, to process this whole massive and sparse matrix dataset (only around 1 % of the entries are non-zero/rated), it would take days to complete the whole training. Therefore for the sake of showing a new solution of deep learning, I would only process a smaller dataset of 2000 top rated movies and 10,000 top users (who gave the most rates). By focusing on this top 11% movies and 0.4% users, I still can retain 10% of the ratings from the whole data.\n\nIn this notebook, I am showing a recommendation system with Keras deep learning, which is quite simple but still can achieve decent accuracy. \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Setup:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom keras.models import Model\nfrom keras.layers import Input, Reshape, Dot\nfrom keras.layers.embeddings import Embedding\nfrom keras.layers import Concatenate, Dense, Dropout\nfrom keras.optimizers import Adam\nfrom keras.regularizers import l2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing Data \n\nAs the raw data format is not readable as csv file, we need some pre-process steps to convert it into csv format and then import to pandas dataframe later\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n## coiuld replace with pd.read_csv and dropping NaNs/ : cols ?
