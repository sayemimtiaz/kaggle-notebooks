The podcast's content is widely distributed over multiple platforms(4 of which are provided in the given [ctds.show dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chai-time-data-science)). Out of the around 10 different platforms the CTDS episodes are hosted on, YouTube is the only platform where CTDS is provided in it's video format.  \n\n<center><img src=\"https://chaitimedatascience.com/content/images/2020/07/ctds-1.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\"></center>\n<center><i><a href=\"https://chaitimedatascience.com/\">Credits</a></i></center>\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"h2\">Table of Contents</div>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#in\">Introduction</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#mpi\">Main Points of Interest</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#dk\">Domain Knowledge</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#mt\">Methodology</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#an\">The Analysis</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#ack\">Acknowledgement</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#ref\">References</a></li>\n</ul>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%HTML\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n\ndiv.h2 {\n    background-color: #E87D23; \n    color: white; \n    padding: 5px; \n    padding-right: 300px; \n    font-size: 30px; \n    max-width: 1500px; \n    margin-top: 2px;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n</style>","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# installing some cool stuff\n\n! pip install dexplot","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='in'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">Introduction</div>\nWhile most followers of the podcast identify with the audio platforms more, it is to be realised that podcasts are less engaging than video. <a href=\"https://makermag.com/podcasts-vs-youtube/\">Video captures the senses of both hearing and sight while a podcast only caters to the former</a>. Also if people are watching a video, we know for sure that more often than not they are paying attention to it. But, as far as podcasts are concerned, you could be watching them at any time. That is even when you are not mentally engaged with the content provided(for example, you could listen to them while doing a chore). This might cause a listener to miss out on key points discussed.  \n<br>\n<br>\nHence, it seems a little more beneficial to analyse the data of CTDS generated from YouTube to see if there are patterns that could possibly provide info on the community as a whole, and if possible provide data-backed suggestions to the host to expand the community watching CTDS on YouTube.

Success is a subjective term and hence, it is defined differently depending upon the question under consideration. However, it is my perception that in general, a CTDS episode can be called successful if it is\n- Visited by a large number of users\n- Watched by these visitors i.e not just \"click and skip to next video\"\n- Able to contribute new subscribers to the CTDS channel\n\nI propose a couple of plans of action that the host could take to make CTDS reach a wider audience =>\n1. ***Have more mini-CTDS series, but do not release them on the same day =>*** Inspite of being clicked on by only very few people, these episodes were highly watched by those who clicked on them. Hence, mini-CTDS episodes could help build specific audience interested in the topic of the mini-series. However, releasing them on the same day takes the spotlight of all episodes. Viewers tend to see the first 1 or 2 and then abort. So, releasing them on separate days will help place more spotlight on each episode.\n2. ***Release more episodes that cater specifically to the budding data science community to generate more subscribers for the channel =>*** It was observed that the most well-recevied episodes on the show catered very specifically to data science aspirants or beginners. These episodes talked about the perspectives on community-driven development, responsibilities of practitioners, career advice to aspirants, domain-specific dependence of data science and tips on application-based learning. The more people love episodes, the more they subscribe and the reach of CTDS grows wider.\n\nSeveral other insights have been provided in this report. However, I leave it to the host's discretion to identify which of those are insights he could act upon.

With the advent of the internet, things became a lot easier and now podcasts are rampant. They are an effective way to reach a wide audience, grow a community and even advertise products.\n<br>\n<br>\nInspite of the large amount of courses and certifications emerging for data science, I personally feel that the best learning comes through interactions with the community - people who are already in the field or people who are with you. Discussions and rounded perspectives lead to more comprehensive, wholesome ideas and will at the end help become more skilled in the given field. Chai Time Data Science offers this very opportunity where the guests on the show are often erudite practitioners with experience on their side. And most of their stories are both inspiring and highly useful to learning at the same time.\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, growing the audience is important for CTDS. There are 2 primary reasons why I feel this should happen.\n<ul>\n    <li>To help broaden the community watching CTDS => The more people watch it, the more they will talk about it, the more it's popularity will spread and finally reach aspiring data scientists who could be benefitted from the show.</li>\n    <li>To create a new CTDS community => CTDS offers an in-depth perspective of the field, where guests range from almost every area. A community built along these lines would be an absolute haven for a beginner(like me) to get into the field.</li>\n</ul>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='mt'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">Methodology</div>\n<br>\n\nThe methodology adopted by me for this analysis is fairly simple to understand and guided by the initative of <strong>data exploration</strong>.

It was also necessary to segregate the results that were discovered into those useful for the host and those that were not that useful. Useful insights are insights that can help the host understand a new facet of the show's reception amongst the broad data science community as well as help the host plan future actions aligned with the insights to widen the audience of the podcast on YouTube.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe diagrammatical representation of the methodology is represented in the figure beneath.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/ry05/ctds-analysis/blob/master/graphics/methodology.png?raw=true\" width=\"900\" height=\"700\"></center>\n<center><i>Credits: Author</i></center>\n<br>\n\n<strong>NOTE:</strong><br>\nSince each episode deals with a new interview with a new practitioner, special care has been taken to not involve any comparisons amongst the guests and their content on the basis of their social, ethnic, gender or professional distinctions.

The first hurdle a CTDS video must cross over is **getting a user X to click on a video's thumbnail**. But, what makes a user want to click on the thumbnail of a video?\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/ry05/ctds-analysis/blob/master/graphics/yt-homepage.png?raw=true\" width=\"900\" height=\"700\"></center>\n<center><i>Credits: Author</i></center>\n<br>\n\nFrom our experience on YouTube(if you don't have any, I recommend you try) we know that a visitor can see the following features of the thumbnail:\n- The type of it\n- The topic to be discussed, the ML hero and other info\n- The duration of the episode\n\nAt this juncture, let's hypothesize that these 3 features that are visible to a visitor play an important role in whether the visitor chooses to click a thumbnail or not. We will see if they hold good. \n\n\n🔍 **WHAT METRIC DEFINES SUCCESS HERE**\n\nIn order to evaluate the success rate of whether a visitor will click on a thumbnail or not, the click through rate(CTR) will be used. The CTR measures the ability of a video to prompt people to watch it after seeing it on their homepage, recommendation section or trending section. \n\n> CTR = Number of Clicks / Number of Impressions * 100\n\n📚 **WHAT DO WE KNOW OR BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE**\n\n**A high CTR for a video indicates that the viewers saw something in its thumbnail that compelled them to click on it**\n\n❗ **NOTE**\n\nEvery user does have a different purpose. So, it's not that simple to generalize all episodes.

One interaction is one continuous unit for which the host speaks.\n    - If this ratio is 2, it means that for every 1 interaction the host asks 2 questions on an average in that episode\n    - If this ratio is more than 1, it could possible indicate a highly curious host!\n    - The average ratio was at 0.67 => On an average the host asked one question in every 2 interactions on the channel\n    - In episode 71 featuring Martin Henze, the first kernels GM, this ratio was at 1.32 => For every 3 interactions with Mr. Henze, the host asked about 4 questions\n- On a random read through the transcripts, it seemed as though the host had a habit of excessively using 'like' in his interactions. Now, 'like' is a very common filler word and a lot of us use it very often because it's a word that can be a part of any sentence! But, filler words are usually discouraged in common speech and it looks like *the host had put some real effort in bringing that to control*\n    - On an average, the host says 'like' 17-18 times per episode\n    - In episode 11, featuring Christine Payne the host used 'like' a staggering 125 times!\n    - From episode 16, the usage of 'like' has been mostly confined to below the mean figure, except slight exceptions\n    - However, in episode 49 with Parul Pandey, a big exception occured with the host registering 65 like-usages\n- The host is someone who talks so much out of his experience and that's what makes CTDS so engaging to watch(atleast for me). This is evident with the signifciant amount of first person usages he brings about at an average of 52 'I' words per episode.\n    - In episode 63, the host uses a whopping 510 'I' words! But, that's because this episode was a conversation/call between the host and the guest, Robert Bracco.\n    \n  \n> There exist no direct correlations between these new features and the number of subscribers per episode.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='ack'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">Acknowledgement</div>\n\nI extend my gratitude to the CTDS team for making this dataset public and hosting this competition.
