This notebook contains the results and insights from 50 polls taken on LinkedIn, which were aimed at freelancers.\n\nThe results were gathered by [Dr. Mikko J. Rissanen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikkor/), a freelancer working primarily in the AR/VR space. The polls were taken to help give him an insight into the average freelancer, enabling him to produce higher quality content on his website [CoachLancer](https://www.coachlancer.com/). CoachLancer aims to assist anyone on the freelancer journey, with advice ranging from getting more clients to general pro tips. You may also know Mikko as 'that coconut guy from LinkedIn'.\n\nAs a freelance data scientist, I thought it would be cool to build upon Mikko's work, compiling the survey results here on Kaggle where others can dissect the data as they see fit. I also thought that it may be helpful to visualize the data so that anyone interested can quickly analyze the data and find their own insights. This data gives a window into the life of a freelancer. As a result, it is primarily aimed at anyone currently working as a freelancer or interested in becoming one. If you're not in that boat but would still like to dig into the findings, please feel free to continue! If you'd like to discuss my conclusions further or offer any suggestions/insights of your own, please feel free to drop me a message [here](http://https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfie-grace-b285ab161/) on LinkedIn. Otherwise, you can drop a comment right here on Kaggle.\n\n*Mikko has provided some of his own insights to contribute to the article.

However, some freelancers have a problem with hourly gigs because as you become more skilled, you can also get jobs done quicker. This results in less billing time.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Questions 6 and 14\n\n# pick colors for the graphs\ncolors = ['#fca55d', '#fee999', '#edf8a3', '#47a0b3']\n\n# define data Q6\nt1 = 'How long would you say you struggled\\nbefore your freelance business\\nbrought you satisfactory income?\\n(19 respondents)'\ndata = df[df.question == 6].iloc[0]\no1 = [\"Weeks\", \"Months\", \"Half a year\", \"One year or more\"]\nr1 = [data.A, data.B, data.C, data.D]\n\n# define data Q14\nt2 = 'How much financial runway (savings\\nfor covering your living expenses)\\ndid you have when you started freelancing?\\n(34 respondents)'\ndata = df[df.question == 14].iloc[0]\no2 = [\"0 months, I felt lucky\", \"<4 months\", \"4-6 months    \\nas recommended\", \">6 months\"]\nr2 = [data.A, data.B, data.C, data.D]\n\n# create the charts\ndual_pies(colors, t1, r1, o1, t2, r2, o2)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T09:51:36.466029Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T09:51:36.46635Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T09:51:36.769988Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T09:51:36.466321Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T09:51:36.768667Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*An alerting number of 35% of freelancers didn’t have ANY SAVINGS to cover their living expenses when they started #freelancing!

However, one of the best things about freelancing is that even though it's hard work, you're working hard for yourself. When you couple this with doing something you love, it can be easy to feel like you aren't doing any work at all.
