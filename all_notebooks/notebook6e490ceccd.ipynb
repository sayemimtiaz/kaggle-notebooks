In addition it provides an easier to read summary of the model's  \nperformance at the end of each epoch. It also provides a handy feature  \nthat enables you to set the number of epochs to train for until a message  \nasks if you wish to halt training on the current epoch by entering H or  \nto enter an integer which will determine how many more epochs to run  \nbefore the message appears again. This is very useful if you are training  \na model and decide the metrics are satisfactory and you want to end  \nthe model training early. Note the callback always returns your model  \nwith the weights set to those of the epoch which had the highest performance  \non the metric being monitored (accuracy or validation accuracy)  \nThe callback initially monitors training accuracy and will adjust the learning  \nrate based on that until the accuracy reaches a user specified threshold  \nlevel. Once that level of training accuracy is achieved the callback switches  \nto monitoring validation loss and adjusts the learning rate based on that.  \nthe callback is of the form:  \ncallbacks=[LRA(model, base_model, patience, stop_patience, threshold,factor, dwell,\n              batches, initial_epoch, epochs, ask_epoch )]    \n **where:**\n - **model** is your compiled model  \n - **base_model** is the name of your base_model if you are doing transfer learning.  \n      for example you might have in your model  \n      base_model=tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB1(include_top=False, weights=\"imagenet\",input_shape=img_shape, pooling='max')\n      base_model.trainabel=False   During training you will be asked if you want to do fine tuning  \n      If you enter F to the query, the base_model will be set to trainable by the callback\n      If you are not doing transfer learning set base_model==None\n - **patience** is an integer that determines many consecutive epochs can occur before the learning rate\n   will be adjusted (similar to patience parameter in Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau)\n \n - **stop_patience** is an integer that determines hom many consecutive epochs for which the\n   learning rate was adjusted but no improvement in the monitored metric occurred before\n   training is halted(similar to patience parameter in early stopping)\n \n - **threshold** is a float that determines the level that training accuracy must achieve\n   before the callback switches over to monitoring validation loss. This  is useful for\n   cases where the validation loss in early epochs tends to vary widely and can cause\n   unwanted behavior when using the conventional Keras callbacks\n - **factor** is a float that determines the new learning rate by the equation lr=lr*factor.\n   (similar to the factor parameter in Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau)\n - **dwell** is a boolean. It is used in the callback as part of an experiment on training\n   models. If on a given epoch the metric being monitored fails to improve it means\n   your model has moved to a location on the surface of Nspace (where N is the number\n   of trainable parameters) that is NOT as favorable (poorer metric performance) than\n   the position in Nspace you were in for the previous epoch. If dwell is set to True\n   the callback loads the model with the weights from the previous (better metric value)\n   epoch. Why move to a worse place if the place you were in previously was better. Then\n   the learning rate is reduced for the next epoch of training. If dwell is set to false\n   this action does not take place.\n - **batches** is an integer. It should be set to a value of \n   batches=int(number of traing samples/batch_size). During training the callback provides\n   information during an epoch of the form\n   'processing batch of batches  accuracy= accuracy  loss= loss where batch is the current \n    batch being processs, batches is as described above, accuracy is the current training\n    accuracy and loss is the current loss. Typically the message would appear as\n    processing batch 25 of 50  accuracy: 54%  loss: .04567. As each batch is processed\n    these values are changed.    \n - **initial_epoch** is an integer. Typically set this to zero Itis used in the information\n    printed out for each epoch. In the case where you train the model say with the\n    basemodel weights frozen say you train for 10 epochs. Then you want to fine tune\n    the model and train for more eppochs for the second training session you would\n    reinstantiate the callback and set initial_epoch=10.\n - **epochs** an integer value for the number of epochs to train\n - **ask_epoch** is either set to an integer value or None. If set to an integer it denotes\n    the epoch number at which user input is requested. If the user enter H training is\n    halted. If the user inters an integer it represents how many more epochs to run\n    before you are asked for the user input again. If the user enters F the base_model\n    is made trainable If ask_epoch is set to None the\n    user is NOT asked to provide any input. This feature is handy is when training your model\n    and the metrics are either unsatisfactory and you want to stop training, or for the case\n    where your metrics are satisfactory and there is no need to train any further. Note\n    you model is always set to the weights for the epoch that had the beset metric\n    performance. So if you halt the training you can still use the model for predictions.  \n      \n### ** Example of Use:\n callbacks=[LRA(model=my_model, base_model=base_model, patience=1,stop_patience=3,  \n            threshold=.9, factor=.5, dwell=True,batches=85, initial_epoch=0 , epochs=20, ask_epoch=5)]\n this implies:\n - your model is my_model\n - base_model is the name of your base_model if you are doing transfer learning\n - after 1 epoch of no improvement the learning rate will be reduced\n - after 3 consecutive adjustment of the leaarning rate with no metric improve training terminates\n - once the training accuracy reaches 90% the callback adjust learning rate based on validation loss\n - when the learning rate is adjust the new learning rate is .5 X learning rate\n - if the current epoch's metric value did not improve, the weights for the prior epoch are loaded\n   and the learning rate is reduced\n - 85 batches of data are run to complete an epoch \n - the initial epoch is 0\n - train for 20 epochs\n - after the fifth epoch you will be asked if you want to halt training by entering H or enter \n   an integer denoting how many more epochs to run before you will be prompted again or enter\n   F to make the base_model=trainable","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019813,"end_time":"2021-05-21T20:58:39.646456","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-21T20:58:39.626643","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras import backend as K\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Activation,Dropout,Conv2D, MaxPooling2D,BatchNormalization, Flatten\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam, Adamax\nfrom tensorflow.keras.metrics import categorical_crossentropy\nfrom tensorflow.keras import regularizers\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model, load_model, Sequential\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport shutil\nimport time\nimport cv2 as cv2\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import imshow\nimport os\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report\nfrom IPython.core.display import display, HTML\n# stop annoying tensorflow warning messages\nimport logging\nlogging.getLogger(\"tensorflow\").setLevel(logging.ERROR)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":5.693249,"end_time":"2021-05-21T20:58:45.358994","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-21T20:58:39.665745","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.964034Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.964388Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.97469Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.964356Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.973877Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Define a function to show example training images","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def show_image_samples(gen ):\n    t_dict=gen.class_indices\n    classes=list(t_dict.keys())    \n    images,labels=next(gen) # get a sample batch from the generator \n    plt.figure(figsize=(20, 20))\n    length=len(labels)\n    if length<25:   #show maximum of 25 images\n        r=length\n    else:\n        r=25\n    for i in range(r):\n        plt.subplot(5, 5, i + 1)\n        image=images[i]/255\n        plt.imshow(image)\n        index=np.argmax(labels[i])\n        class_name=classes[index]\n        plt.title(class_name, color='blue', fontsize=12)\n        plt.axis('off')\n    plt.show()","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.03267,"end_time":"2021-05-21T20:59:58.764761","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-21T20:59:58.732091","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.976186Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.97659Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.989925Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.976554Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.989078Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Define  a function to print text in RGB foreground and background colors","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def print_in_color(txt_msg,fore_tupple,back_tupple,):\n    #prints the text_msg in the foreground color specified by fore_tupple with the background specified by back_tupple \n    #text_msg is the text, fore_tupple is foregroud color tupple (r,g,b), back_tupple is background tupple (r,g,b)\n    rf,gf,bf=fore_tupple\n    rb,gb,bb=back_tupple\n    msg='{0}' + txt_msg\n    mat='\\33[38;2;' + str(rf) +';' + str(gf) + ';' + str(bf) + ';48;2;' + str(rb) + ';' +str(gb) + ';' + str(bb) +'m' \n    print(msg .format(mat), flush=True)\n    print('\\33[0m', flush=True) # returns default print color to back to black\n    return","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.078026,"end_time":"2021-05-21T21:00:02.099684","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-21T21:00:02.021658","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.991555Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.991918Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-25T06:37:41.000026Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.991883Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-25T06:37:40.999168Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Define a subclass of Keras callbacks that will control the learning rate and print\n### training data in spreadsheet format.
