Modeling the Data: Logistic Regression Analysis\n***\n**NOTE:** This will be an in-depth analysis of using logistic regression as a classifier. I do go over other types of models in the other section below this. **This is more of a use-case example of what can be done and explained to management in a company.**\n\nLogistic Regression commonly deals with the issue of how likely an observation is to belong to each group. This model is commonly used to predict the likelihood of an event occurring. In contrast to linear regression, the output of logistic regression is transformed with a logit function. This makes the output either 0 or 1. This is a useful model to take advantage of for this problem because we are interested in predicting whether an employee will leave (0) or stay (1). \n\nAnother reason for why logistic regression is the preferred model of choice is because of its interpretability. Logistic regression predicts the outcome of the response variable (turnover) through a set of other explanatory variables, also called predictors. In context of this domain, the value of our response variable is categorized into two forms: 0 (zero) or 1 (one). The value of 0 (zero) represents the probability of an employee not leaving the company and the value of 1 (one) represents the probability of an employee leaving the company.\n\n**Logistic Regression models the probability of ‘success’ as: **\n<img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/m95a9k.jpg\"/>\n \nThe equation above shows the relationship between, the dependent variable (success), denoted as (θ) and independent variables or predictor of event, denoted as xi.

This is a false positive. This mistake could be expensive, inconvenient, and time consuming for both the Human Resources and employee, but is a good investment for relational growth. \n\nCompare this with the opposite error, where Human Resources does not give treatment/incentives to the employees and they do leave. This is a false negative. This type of error is more detrimental because the company lost an employee, which could lead to great setbacks and more money to rehire. \nDepending on these errors, different costs are weighed based on the type of employee being treated. For example, if it’s a high-salary employee then would we need a costlier form of treatment? What if it’s a low-salary employee? The cost for each error is different and should be weighed accordingly. \n \n **Solution 1:** \n - We can rank employees by their probability of leaving, then allocate a limited incentive budget to the highest probability instances.\n - OR, we can allocate our incentive budget to the instances with the highest expected loss, for which we'll need the probability of turnover.\n\n**Solution 2:** \nDevelop learning programs for managers.

Departments (see if there are actual differences)?\nOnce defined, did these high performers leave? If so, why? Are we not providing opportunities or recognizing these high performers? Is it a lack of salary?\n\nTo add some additional context, 24% turnover rate is high in general but do we know what industry this is from? If the industry norm is 50%, this company is doing great! I see you've done Turnover by dept which is great. If only we have more info and classify these turnovers.\n\nWe have voluntary and involuntary turnovers as well. Also, who are these employees - is it part timers, contract workers that turn over? We don't worry about those, they're suppose to go. I'd like to see Turnover vs. Years of service. In real life, we found a cluster / turning point where people 'turn sour' after about 5 years at the company. Can we see satisfaction vs. years at company?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"96e9273f5e366d479e71c1f1b5555cbbdc02abd2","_cell_guid":"5edf8013-9379-4d38-a76d-c9047bb1862e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Recommended Websites:\n***\n\nStatiscal Concepts: https://www.youtube.com/user/BCFoltz/playlists\n\nCommon Machine Learning Algorithms: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-whats-inside-box-randy-lao/\n\nBasics of Machine Learning: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-fresh-bloods-randy-lao/\n\nData Science Pipeline (OSEMN): https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/life-data-science-osemn-randy-lao/\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8da30470d2d7e8ebaf60ab4db0faf9ac396e45dc","_cell_guid":"16fc68e6-3e50-4040-aaa2-47dc7585a442"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Edits:\n***\n\n**To Do's:** \n1.
