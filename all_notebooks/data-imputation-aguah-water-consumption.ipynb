Impute the real missing values</h1>\n<p>Now,  it is time to impute the missing values in the real dataset. My strategy is as follows: As we tested above on the complete entries (Non-NA entries), I will use the best two methods of imputation - KNN and linear. First, I fill in the missing data in \"Interupted\" entries with KNN but only for those that have up to 5 missing values in a row. Second, rows with many NaN values in \"Interupted\" group will be imputed using linear method. \"Edge-NA\" entries will not be imputed as I explained above.</p>","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"execution_state":"idle"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c2153475-91bb-8059-6f16-0675bfb28965","_active":false},"source":"<p>Let me define first a function that implements imputation using <code>KnnImputeSimple</code> above.

Conclusion\n</h1>\n<p>It was a fun exercise to practice impute missing values. I analyzed the data set into three categorical groups namely - Non-NA, Edge-NA, Interupted. Non-NA is the groupwith complete entries, Edge-NA is the one with NaN values at both extremes (it is nothing wrong I guess as the service may start later or end earlier.). The last group is Interupted with NaN value(s) appeared during <i>service</i> period. The entire data set is relatively big however the entries that need to be imputed (Interupted) are about 3% of the dataset. As per my analysis above, the imputation method based on K-nearestneight - which was the best during the test - was used for entries with small number of missing values. Entries with large number of missing values within the service period was imputed by linear method. Some instances of the imputed dataset are presented above. It looks quite reasonable even though I used only 1% of the entire dataset sample for KNN.</p>","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"execution_state":"idle"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"76551ce8-459e-3efd-e7d0-8f9e2321b43a","_active":false},"source":"<h1>End Note</h1>\n<p>I didn't impute Null values at both extremes (Edge-NAs) as I considered these as normal data. However if one needs to impute these too, then I suggest using ffill and bfill methods to do so. I didn't touch Jan2016 column as I am not convinced that this column contains the right values (too much variation from the previous month, 2015-12). One might take this as part of the dataset for analysis. </p>\n\n<p>It became a quite long notebook but I had fun testing it.
