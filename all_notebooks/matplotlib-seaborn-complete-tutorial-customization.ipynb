Not all plots are same. Some are suitable for Numerical while others are for Categorical\n2. There are default settings which apply for all the plots and you can change\n3. Subplots are plots within plots are used widely and have **almost** have same functions as `plt` module.\n4. matplotlib accepts both numpy as well as pandas dataframes and series\n\n# Common Functionality\nA matplotlib object is basically a figure with some specified dimensions and you can have a single figure in it, multiple subplots or **If you plot different plots within a same figure, you'll have overlapped instances within that figure** \n\nFor Every plot, there are some common Functionalities such as:\n1. Figure: `fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5,5)` gives us the figure of size (5,5) for current cell. A new figure is initialized with default dimensions each time a plt object is called in a new cell. We do not usually need this unless we want to change the size of figure.\n2. Title: `plt.title('Here goes the Title)` tells us about that what the figure is all about and what does it show\n3. X Label: `plt.xlabel('Meaning of X axis')` tells us about the what X-axis in our figure is representing\n4. Y Label: `plt.ylabel('Meaning of Y Axis')`  tells us about the what X-axis in our figure is representing\n5. X,Y Ticks: `plt.xticks()`, `plt.yticks()` Change the color of ticks on x,Y axis, their padding, rotation etc etc\n6. Legend: `plt.legend()` when there are more than 2 lines in the same plot than the legend defines which color line reprsents which property.\n7. Show/Save: `plt.show()`, `plt.savefig()` shows or saves the figure\n8. Colors: Colors in matplotlib can be used using different values such as `(0,1,0)`, `'g'`, `'green` and `#00ff00` all for green color.\n9. Multicolor: In casethere are multiple plots such as bars, lines etc in same plot, matplotlib generates colors on its own but if you want to give custom colors, you an use the  colormap `plt.cm` or give a custom list of lists of RGB values 1 for each entity.\n10. Size: Size parameter is almost same where we need to print a string or some comment and size can be a string as 'large' or some integer such as 12.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"figure = plt.figure(figsize=(13,6))\n\nplt.title('TITLE: This Figure (13,6) demonstrate general attributes with color given in hex (#343ff3) and size=15',color='#343ff3',size=15)\n\nplot1 = plt.plot([4,1,4,6,9],label='First Line Shows Something inside legend')\nplot2 = plt.plot([5,6,2,4,5], label='Second line has different meaning')\nplot3 = plt.plot([3,7,6,4,0],label='Third Line is of different color')\n\nplt.xlabel('This is X-axis with default size and Red Color [1,0,0] and it shows number (count) of values in our figure as x-large alphabets in teal color'\n           ,color=[1,0,0])\n\nplt.ylabel('Y-Label with large \"g\" green fonts, and padding of 40 tells us the range of values',\n           color='g',labelpad=40, size='large')\n\nplt.xticks([0,1,2,3,4],['a','b','c','d','e'],color='teal',size='x-large')\n\nplt.legend(loc='best') # you can do a lot more with legend\n# plt.grid() # show a grid in background to show major, minor or both lines and whether for x, y or both axis\n# with seaborn style grid is true automatically\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Subplots\nAlmost all of the people tend to cover this as the last part and they tend to do it differently as there are more than 1 methods for plotting the subplots. TBH, it confused me a lot and I chose 1 solution for it all for subplots using the Functional methods. What I am going to do below will be very helpful for you in generating the dynamic subplots on the go. It just works like the `plt.something()` except the naming.\n1. Creation: You can create subplots by `figure,axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=2,figsize(15,7)` which will create a Father Figure of width 15 and height 7. Inside this, there will be 4 evenly spaced subplots. `axes` is a numpy array which contains the 4 different axes. You can access then as `axes[i][j]`.\n2. Flatten: Best way to use the axes object is to `ravel()` of `flatten()` so that you can index using only 1 integer instead of 2.\n3. Accessing: You can simply access the subplots just using `axes[i].plot()`.\n4. Editing: Almost all of the methods you saw above are accessible in subplots too such as `ax[i].set_ylabel()` or `ax[i].set_title()`. You can refer to documentation anytime to check the related methods.\n5. Merging: You can merge 2 subplots either as column or row wise, share Y,X or both axes, or customize on yorr own using different methods available.\n6. Deletion: You can delete a specific subplot by using `figure.delaxes(ax[i])`.\n\n<font color='red'>Spacing of Subplots is basically dependent on the ratio of the Figure's Height and Width. A jupyter notebook can display a maximum width of 15 but graphs can interactive too so that you could zoom in on a specific part (beyong the scope of this notebook). You can always change the spacing by changing the default parameters for spacing which are </font> `plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.125, bottom=0.1, right=0.9, top=0.9, wspace=0.2, hspace=0.2)`. `wspace` and `hspace` are relative width and height spaces for the subplots with respect to the total width and height. You can also use `plt.tight_layout()` to auto adjust the subplots so that no 2 subplots touch each other.\n\n**We'll be Looking at the subplots in the coming sections**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Univariate Graphs\nThese Graphs can be seen as the Analysis of one Variable only.
