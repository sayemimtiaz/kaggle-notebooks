Data visualization & insights\n\n\nThere are several interested fingings here!\n\n**Recipe Types:**\n* Housewares recipes are far more than any other types. Animal Crossing New Horizons features an extensive list of different furniture objects and other items that you can use to decorate your home and other parts of the island. However, in Animal Crossing World, players don't have rights to design their own furniture, all housewares are predesigned.Players have to gather recpes or exchange with friends to get more rare housewares to decorate their idland. BTW...The competition for the most incredible island was fierce, there are so many island tour videos on YouTube!\n\n* Amount of clothes,bags,shoes,bottom recipes are relative lower than others. The differents from housewares, players could deigin pattern for their outfit to make it unique. ACNH only provide basic type of clothes.The secret to getting the most creative, hilarious and downright bonkers Animal Crossing wallpapers, artworks and outfits in your game is in custom designs — and rather than have to sketch your own, you can scan those that helpful designers have already created straight into your game using QR codes, which made ACNH more social than any other games! Players also create their only community to share outfit ideas or island plannng examples.\n\n\n**Recipe could buy by Mile**\n\nInteresting! I played ACNH for months and never thought of there are only two types of recipe could purchase by mile point.\n\n**Source**\n* You could get 76 kinds of recipes by shooting down balloons with your slingshot! It's despair to know it untill now...\n* Don't be picky when you pick your villagers or reject it due to it's snooty or smug,it 'll give you recipes equally as other villagers with good characters. If you want to collect all reipes, please don't be prejudiced. Great job Nintendo!\n* There are also several seasonal limited rescources，like Easter egg bottle/balloon.\n* Some recipes offered when you accomplish certan challenge,like shooting 300 ballons,fishing up all 3 trash items etc.\n\nHope this plot will give you reference where could get recipes!\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\n##Plot 1 Recipe Types\nplt.subplot(221)\nCategory= pd.DataFrame({'values':recipes.groupby('Category').size().sort_values(ascending=False).values,\n                        'index':recipes.groupby('Category').size().sort_values(ascending=False).index.to_list()})\norder=recipes.groupby('Category').size().sort_values(ascending=False).index\nsns.barplot(y='values',x='index',data=Category,order=order)\nax = plt.gca()\n#Adjust xlabels for fitting the graph\nax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=30, ha='right')\n#Add label for each cols\nfor a,b in zip(Category.index,Category['values']):\n    plt.text(a, b+0.001, '%d' % b, ha='center', va= 'bottom',fontsize=9)\nplt.title('Recipe Types')\nplt.xlabel('Types')\n\n\n##Plot 2 Recipe could buy by Mile\nplt.subplot(222)\nrecipes_copy=recipes.copy()\nrecipes_copy.dropna(subset=['Miles Price'],how='any',inplace=True)\nCategory= pd.DataFrame({'values':recipes_copy.groupby('Category').size().sort_values(ascending=False).values,\n                        'index':recipes_copy.groupby('Category').size().sort_values(ascending=False).index.to_list()})\norder=recipes_copy.groupby('Category').size().sort_values(ascending=False).index\nsns.barplot(y='values',x='index',data=Category,order=order)\nax = plt.gca()\n#Add label for each cols\nfor a,b in zip(Category.index,Category['values']):\n    plt.text(a, b+0.001, '%d' % b, ha='center', va= 'bottom',fontsize=9)\n#Add label for each cols\nplt.xlabel('Types')\nplt.title('Recipe could buy by Mile')\n\n\n##Plot 3 Recipe Source\nplt.subplot(212)\nSource= pd.DataFrame({'values':recipes.groupby('Source').size().sort_values(ascending=False).values,\n                        'index':recipes.groupby('Source').size().sort_values(ascending=False).index.to_list()})\norder_Source=recipes.groupby('Source').size().sort_values(ascending=False).index\nsns.barplot(y='values',x='index',data=Source,order=order_Source)\nax = plt.gca()\n#Adjust xlabels for fitting the graph\nax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=90, ha='right')\n#Add label for each cols\nfor a,b in zip(Source.index,Source['values']):\n    plt.text(a, b+0.001, '%d' % b, ha='center', va= 'bottom',fontsize=9)\nplt.title('Recipe Source')\nplt.xlabel('Source')\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.
