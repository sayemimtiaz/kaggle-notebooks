{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Background\n\n**Background:**\n>**Bulgarian pop-folk** (hereinafter referred to as **chalga**) is a dance genre, stemming from ethno-pop, with strong hints of Oriental rhythms and instrumentals.  Chalga is one of many branches of Balkan folk throughout the peninsula (turbofolk in Serbia, manele in Romania etc.) After the fall of communism in 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe, chalga rapidly found place in everyday life. <br>\n\n>Chalga relies on provocativity, and tracks commonly contain sexually explicit lyrics. Because of this, it causes much controversy in society and there is sparse scientific work in the field. Nevertheless, chalga becomes an increasingly popular musical style. As such, we believe it must be subject to development. Finding its 'evolution' constitutes the main scientific motivation behind this study.\n\n**This work serves the purpose of providing a general Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the [Bulgarian popfolk songs](https://www.kaggle.com/astronasko/payner) dataset.**\n\n## Preliminary\nThe main visualisation tools in the present notebook are ``matplotlib`` and ``seaborn``.

Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"top_feature_songs(data, n=5, feature='energy')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The track with highest resolved energy is ['Noshtta garmi'](https://youtu.be/D3vBCYwS34Y?t=1) by Galin and Lorena, scoring 0.995!

Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).\n\nIt is important to note that the decibel scale is logarithmic, as human hearing responds logarithmically to auditory stimuli by the [Weber-Fechner's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law?oldformat=true).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"top_feature_songs(data, n=5, feature='loudness')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The loudest resolved song by PlanetaOfficial in 2012-2019 is ['Noshtta garmi'](https://youtu.be/D3vBCYwS34Y?t=1) by Galin and Lorena.

A good question arises: **Are energy and loudness correlated?**\n\n### Speechiness\n> Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"top_feature_songs(data, n=5, feature='speechiness')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The song with most speech detected is ['Chuzda staya'](https://youtu.be/OUyolqrl-OM), scoring 32.8 per cent.

We want to ensure the best listening experience for users, so we apply Loudness Normalization to create a balance.\n>It also levels the playing field between soft and loud masters. Louder tracks have often been cited as sounding better to listeners, so Loudness Normalization removes any unfair advantage.\n\nThere are indications that loudness may have correlated with duration in 2014-2015, judging by the shape of the core. That is to say, tracks around the 4:00 mark may have been marginally louder than ones around the 3:00 mark, on average.  It is interesting to see that in the intermediate period, 2016-2017, a subset of tracks have moved rightwards and downwards.

This is in favour of the 'Every artist is unique!' idea. Moreover, these artist-specific tendencies in solo songs are recognised as a good opportunity for future machine learning (artist classification);\n* **PlanetaOfficial seems to have three short-term changes in tracks**:\n    1. **Duration of songs was slightly lowered in the 2018-2019,** though still kept to the industrial standard (around 3:30);\n    2. **Songs are grouped in two main groups by tempo: high-tempo (>125 BPM) and low-tempo (<125 BPM). High-tempo songs rose much in count in 2018-2019,** compared to 2014-2017. This gives reason to think such transition was intentional by PlanetaOfficial;\n    3. **Songs became more quiet.** Their overall loudness was normalised, as a consequence of the Spotify Normalization campaign.\n\n**To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative analysis of Bulgarian pop-folk that is publically available.**\n\nPlease note that this is an ongoing project.
