It presents six classifiers that will be compared at the cross validation part. I will explain how to compute the different evaluate metrics on the binary classification case.**\n\nThe studied classifiers are:\n* Logistic regression\n* Naive Bayes\n* Linear Support Vector Machine\n* Decision tree classifier\n* Random forest classifier\n* Gradient-boosted tree classifier\n\nChurn prediction is big business. It minimizes customer defection by predicting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service. Though originally used within the telecommunications industry, it has become common practice across banks, ISPs, insurance firms, and other verticals.\n\nThe prediction process is heavily data driven and often utilizes advanced machine learning techniques. In this post, we will take a look at what types of customer data are typically used, do some preliminary analysis of the data, and generate churn prediction models - all with PySpark and its machine learning frameworks.

Using Spark MLlib Package\n\nThe [MLlib package](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html) provides a variety of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, cluster and dimensionality reduction, as well as utilities for model evaluation. The decision tree is a popular classification algorithm, and we will be using extensively in this part.  \n\n<a id=\"t5.1.\"></a>\n### 5.1. Decision Tree Models\n\nDecision trees have played a significant role in data mining and machine learning since the 1960's. They generate white-box classification and regression models which can be used for feature selection and sample prediction. The transparency of these models is a big advantage over black-box learners, because the models are easy to understand and interpret, and they can be readily extracted and implemented in any programming language (with nested if-else statements) for use in production environments. Furthermore, decision trees require almost no data preparation (ie normalization) and can handle both categorical and continuous data. To remedy over-fitting and improve prediction accuracy, decision trees can also be limited to a certain depth or complexity, or bundled into ensembles of trees (ie random forests).\n\nA decision tree is a predictive model which maps observations (features) about an item to conclusions about the item's label or class. The model is generated using a top-down approach, where the source dataset is split into subsets using a statistical measure, often in the form of the Gini index or information gain via Shannon entropy. This process is applied recursively until a subset contains only samples with the same target class, or is halted by a predefined stopping criteria.\n\n<a id=\"t5.2.\"></a>\n### 5.2. Model Training\n\nMLlib classifiers and regressors require data sets in a format of rows of type ``LabeledPoint``, which separates row labels and feature lists, and names them accordingly. The custom ``labelData()`` function shown below performs the row parsing. We will pass it the prepared data set (``CV_data``) and split it further into training and testing sets. A decision tree classifier model is then generated using the training data, using a ``maxDepth`` of 2, to build a \"shallow\" tree. The tree depth can be regarded as an indicator of model complexity. \n\n**Note:** you can't ``map`` a dataframe, but you can convert the dataframe to an ``RDD`` and ``map`` that by doing ``data.rdd.map()``."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from pyspark.mllib.regression import LabeledPoint\nfrom pyspark.mllib.tree import DecisionTree\n\ndef labelData(data):\n    # label: row[end], features: row[0:end-1]\n    return data.rdd.map(lambda row: LabeledPoint(row[-1], row[:-1]))\n\ntraining_data, testing_data = labelData(CV_data).randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])\n\nprint(\"The two first rows of the training data RDD:\")\nprint(training_data.take(2))\nprint(\"============================\")\n\nmodel = DecisionTree.trainClassifier(training_data, numClasses=2, maxDepth=2,\n                                     categoricalFeaturesInfo={1:2, 2:2},\n                                     impurity='gini', maxBins=32)\nprint(model.toDebugString())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The ``toDebugString()`` function provides a print of the tree's decision nodes and final prediction outcomes at the end leafs.

Using Spark ML Package\n\nThe [ML package](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html) is the newer library of machine learning routines. It provides an API for pipelining data transformers, estimators and model selectors. It will be used here to perform cross-validation across several classifiers in order to find the optimal model.\n\n<a id=\"t6.1.\"></a>\n### 6.1. Pipelining\n\nThe ML package needs data be put in a (``label: Double, features: Vector``) DataFrame format with correspondingly named fields using the ``VectorAssembler`` function. The global ``get_dummy`` function defined below performs this formatting in which we will also pass the data through a pipeline of two transformers, ``StringIndexer`` and ``VectorIndexer`` which index the label and features fields respectively. \n\n<a id=\"t6.2.\"></a>\n### 6.2. Model Selection\n\nGiven the data set at hand, we would like to determine which parameter values of or classifier produce the best model. We need a systematic approach to quantatively measure the performance of the models and ensure that the results are reliable. This task of model selection is often done using cross validation techniques. A common technique is k-fold cross validation, where the data is randomly split into k partitions. Each partition is used once as the testing data set, while the rest are used for training. Models are then generated using the training sets and evaluated with the testing sets, resulting in k model performance measurements. The average of the performance scores is often taken to be the overall score of the model, given its build parameters.\n\nFor model selection, we can search through the model parameters, comparing their cross validation performances. The model parameters leading to the highest performance metric produce the best model.\n\nThe ML package supports k-fold cross validation, which can be readily coupled with a parameter grid builder and an evaluator to construct a model selection workflow. Below, we will use a transformation/estimation pipeline to train our classifier models.

Conclusion\n\nThe Decision tree, Random forest and Gradient-boosted tree are the more efficient classifiers. However, the best model created according to the cross validation process seems to be the Decision tree. Indeed, the different metrics obtained by using this classifier are higher as well as very close to each other comparing to those of the other classifiers. An explication on how to compute all the different metrics excepting both area under ROC and area under PR is given in a function called ``printAllMetrics``.\n\nOther improvements are still to be expected very soon as a prediction based on cross validation applying the ``ParamGridBuilder`` to iterate through required parameters according to each classifier.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope this tutorial was helpful."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
