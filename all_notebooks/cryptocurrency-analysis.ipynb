Due to this there are many new altcoins are coming in the market. Everywhere we can see the news of people making lots of money through such coins. This rases a question will any of these coins ever replace the gold standard of cryptocurrency that is bitcoin. A similar news regarding one of the altcoin name Dogecoin has got lots of traction and fame. Some people go to even that extreme saying it can replace bitcoin. But can it really do it? What is the difference between Dogecoin and bitcoin we will see through various charts in the following notebook\n\n##### First, we will go through some theoretical parts of Bitcoin and dogecoin.\n\n<br>\n<a style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 3px; color: #732C2C; background-color: #ffffff;\">Bitcoin</a>\n    \nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency developed in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the name given to the unknown creator (or creators) of this virtual currency. Transactions are recorded in a blockchain, which shows the transaction history for each unit and is used to prove ownership. Unlike investing in traditional currencies, bitcoin is not issued by a central bank or backed by a government; therefore, the monetary policy, inflation rates, and economic growth measurements that typically influence the value of currency do not apply to bitcoin.\n\n<a style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #732C2C; background-color: #ffffff;\">Key Points</a>\n* Purchasing stocks grants you ownership in a company, whereas purchasing bitcoin grants you ownership of that cryptocurrency.\n* Bitcoin is neither issued nor regulated by a central government and therefore is not subject to governmental monetary policies.\n* Bitcoin prices are primarily affected by its supply, the market's demand for it, availability, and competing cryptocurrencies.\n* As of December 2020, approximately 88.5% of the total bitcoin supply had been mined.\n\nThe supply of bitcoin is impacted in two different ways. First, the bitcoin protocol allows new bitcoins to be created at a fixed rate. New bitcoins are introduced into the market when miners process blocks of transactions, and the rate at which new coins are introduced is designed to slow over time. For example, growth slowed from 6.9% (2016), to 4.4% (2017) to 4.0% (2018).1 This can create scenarios in which the demand for bitcoins increases at a faster rate than the supply increases, which can drive up the price. The slowing of bitcoin circulation growth is due to the halving of block rewards offered to bitcoin miners and can be thought of as artificial inflation for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nSecondly, supply may also be impacted by the number of bitcoins the system allows to exist. This number is capped at 21 million.\n\n<br>\n<a style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 3px; color: #732C2C; background-color: #ffffff;\">Dogecoin</a>\n\nDogecoin marketed itself as a \"fun\" version of Bitcoin with a Shibu Inu (Japanese dog) as its logo. Dogecoin's casual presentation suited the mood of the burgeoning crypto community. Its script technology and unlimited supply was an argument for a faster, more adaptable, and consumer-friendly version of Bitcoin.\n\n<a style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color: #732C2C; background-color: #ffffff;\">Key Points</a>\n\n* Dogecoin is an open-source cryptocurrency started in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus.\n* Dogecoin initially started as a joke based on a popular meme featuring a Shiba Inu (a Japanese breed of dog).\n* It is based on Litecoin and has the same technology behind its proof-of-work.\n* Dogecoin has a loyal community of supporters who trade it and use it as a tipping currency for social media content.\n\nDogecoin is an \"inflationary coin,\" while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are deflationary because there is a ceiling on the number of coins that will be created. Every four years the amount of Bitcoin released into circulation via mining rewards is halved and its inflation rate is halved along with it until all coins are released.\n\n\n<br></br>\n<a style=\"font-family: Verdana;

Is Dogecoin a new Bitcoin? or Dogecoin will replace Bitcoin ever? Ans is no from the graphs we can clearly see that Ethereum, and Bitcoin are quite a lot safer than Dogecoin and Bitconnect. Which is why they are surviving the fall in 2018 and will survive through current dip in price too. The fall of dogecoin is inevitable. Although Dogecoin is not a scam. But the cultural structure of dogecoin digs a grave for itself. Invest your money wisely after doing your own research.","metadata":{}}]}
