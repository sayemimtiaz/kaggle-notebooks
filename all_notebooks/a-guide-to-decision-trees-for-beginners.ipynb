They are very powerful algorithms, capable of fitting complex datasets. Decision Trees split the instances into two or more homogeneous sets based on most significant splitter / differentiator in input variables.\n\nDecision Trees are also the fundamental components of Random Forests, which are among the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available today.\n\n### <u> Advantages </u>\n- <b><u>Easy to Understand</u></b>: Decision tree output is very easy to understand even for people from non-analytical background. It does not require any statistical knowledge to read and interpret them. Its graphical representation is very intuitive and users can easily relate their hypothesis.\n    \n- <b><u>Useful in Data exploration</u></b>: Decision tree is one of the fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables. With the help of decision trees, we can create new variables / features that has better power to predict target variable. You can refer article (Trick to enhance power of regression model) for one such trick.  It can also be used in data exploration stage. For example, we are working on a problem where we have information available in hundreds of variables, there decision tree will help to identify most significant variable.\n- <b><u>Less data cleaning required</u></b>: It requires less data cleaning compared to some other modeling techniques. It is not influenced by outliers and missing values to a fair degree.\n- <b><u>Data type is not a constraint</u></b>: It can handle both numerical and categorical variables.\n- <b><u>Non Parametric Model</u></b>: Decision trees are considered to be a non-parametric models, not because they do not have any parameters (they often have a lot) but because the number of parameters are not determined prior to training, so the model structure is free to stick closely to the data. In contrast, a parametric model such as a linear model has a predetermined number of parameters, so its degree of freedom is limited, reducing the risk of overfitting (but increasing the risk of underfitting).\n\n### <u> Disadvantages </u>\n- <b><u>Over fitting</u></b>: Over fitting is one of the most practical difficulty for decision tree models. This problem gets solved by setting constraints on model parameters and pruning.\n- <b><u>Not fit for continuous variables</u></b>: While working with continuous numerical variables, decision tree looses information when it categorizes variables in different categories."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <u> Training and Visualizing a Decision Tree </u>\n\nTo understand Decision Trees, let’s just build one and take a look at how it makes predictions."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_graphviz\n\ndf_iris = pd.read_csv(\"../input/iris/Iris.csv\")\n\n# Removing the unnecessary column\ndf_iris.drop('Id',axis=1,inplace=True)\n\ndf_iris_X = df_iris[['SepalLengthCm','SepalWidthCm','PetalLengthCm','PetalWidthCm']]\ndf_iris_y = df_iris.Species\n\ntree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state = 36)\ntree_clf.fit(df_iris_X, df_iris_y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Visualize the trained Decision Tree by export_graphviz() method\n\nfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphviz\nfrom sklearn import tree\nfrom IPython.display import SVG\nfrom graphviz import Source\nfrom IPython.display import display\n\nlabels = df_iris_X.columns\n\ngraph = Source(tree.export_graphviz(tree_clf ,feature_names = labels, class_names = df_iris_y.unique(), max_depth = 2, filled = True))\ndisplay(SVG(graph.pipe(format='svg')))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <u>Making Predictions</u>\n\nThe classification starts at the root node (depth 0, top node) and check whether the flower’s petal length is smaller than 2.45 cm. If True, it move down to the root’s left child node (depth 1, left). Since it is a leaf node, it predicts that the flower is an Iris-Setosa (class=setosa). If False, it move down to the root’s right child node (depth 1, right), which is not a leaf node, so it asks another question: is the petal width smaller than 1.75 cm? If True, flower is most likely an Iris-Versicolor (depth 2, left). If False, it is likely an Iris-Virginica (depth 2, right).\n\n- <b> <u> Samples </u> </b>: counts how many training instances it applies to. For example, 100 training instances have a petal length greater than 2.45 cm (depth 1, right), among which 54 have a petal width smaller than 1.75 cm (depth 2, left).\n- <b> <u> Value </u> </b>:  tells us how many training instances of each class this node applies to: for example, the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 Iris- Versicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica.\n- <b> <u> Gini </u> </b>: measures impurity: a node is “pure” (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same class. For example, since the depth-1 left node applies only to Iris-Setosa training instances, it is pure and its gini score is 0, the depth-2 left node has a gini score equal to 1 – $\\frac{0}{54}^2$ – $\\frac{49}{54}^2$ – $\\frac{5}{54}^2$ ≈ 0.168.\n- <b><u> Entropy </u></b>: By default, Gini impurity measure is used, we can select the entropy impurity measure instead by setting the criterion hyperparameter to \"entropy\". A set’s entropy is zero when it contains instances of only one class.  For example, since the depth-1 left node applies only to Iris-Setosa training instances, it is pure and its entropy is 0, the depth-2 left node has entropy equal to − $\\frac{49}{54}$ $\\log\\big({\\frac{49}{54}}\\big)$ − $\\frac{5}{54}$ $\\log\\big({\\frac{5}{54}}\\big)$ ≈ 0.31.\n\n<b>Note </b>: A node’s Gini impurity is generally lower than its parent’s. This is ensured by the CART training algorithm’s cost function, which splits each node in a way that minimizes the weighted sum of its children’s Gini impurities. However, if one child is smaller than the other, it is possible for it to have a higher Gini impurity than its parent, as long as this increase is more than compensated for by a decrease of the other child’s impurity.\n\n#### <u> Gini impurity or Entropy ? </u>\n\nMost of the time it does not make a big difference: they lead to similar trees. Gini impurity is slightly faster to compute, so it is a good default. However, Gini impurity tends to isolate the most frequent class in its own branch of the tree, while entropy tends to produce slightly more balanced trees."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <u> Estimating Class/ Class Probabilities </u>\n\nDecision Tree can estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class k: It traverses the tree to find the leaf node for this instance and returns the ratio of training instances of class k in this node.

The corresponding leaf node is the depth-2 left node, so the Decision Tree should output the following probabilities: 0% for Iris-Setosa $\\frac{0}{54}$, 90.7% for Iris-Versicolor $\\frac{49}{54}$, and 9.25% for Iris-Virginica $\\frac{5}{54}$.\n\nIt can also predict the instance class.

The algorithm first splits the training set in two subsets using a single feature k and a threshold $t_k$ (e.g., “petal length ≤ 2.45 cm”). How does it choose k and $t_k$ ? It searches for the pair (k, $t_k$) that produces the purest subsets (weighted by their size). The cost function that the algorithm tries to minimize is given by:\n\n$$J(k, t_k) = \\frac{m_{left}}{m} G_{left} + \\frac{m_{right}}{m} G_{right}$$\n\nwhere $G_{left/right}$ = measures the impurity of the left/right subset, $m_{left/right}$ = is the number of instances in the left/right subset.\n\nOnce it successfully split the training set in two, it splits the subsets using the same logic, then the sub-subsets and so on, recursively. It stops recursing once it reaches a set hyperparameter( maximum depth / min_samples_split / min_sam ples_leaf / min_weight_fraction_leaf / max_leaf_nodes), or if it cannot find a split that will reduce impurity.\n\n<b>Note: </b> CART algorithm is a greedy algorithm: it greedily searches for an optimum split at the top level, then repeats the process at each level.

Decision Trees are generally approximately balanced, so traversing the Decision Tree requires going through roughly $O(log_2(m))$ nodes. Since each node only requires checking the value of one feature, the overall prediction complexity is just O(log2(m)), independent of the number of features. So predictions are very fast, even when dealing with large training sets.\n\nHowever, the training algorithm compares all features (or less if max_features is set) on all samples at each node. This results in a training complexity of O(n × m log(m)) where n = num. of fearures, m = number of instances.
