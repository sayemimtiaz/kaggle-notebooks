It mentioned how the number of road accidents in India touched all time high in 2018. The article can be found here: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-1-51-lakh-died-in-road-accidents-last-year-up-tops-among-states/articleshow/72078508.cms\n\n![Acc](https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2014-12/18/full/1418893966-5053.jpg)\n\nImg Source: https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2014-12/18/full/1418893966-5053.jpg\n\nAnd this intrigued me. I wanted to explore the data, to see if there are causes which I can match up to the numbers of injuries or deaths reported. https://data.gov.in/ has some data available.  \n\nIn this kernel, I will be analyzing the data on road accidents from 2014-2017. I also found some supporting road accident data i.e. weather conditions for the accidents and the road conditions. There are some oher supporting data available which you can use to understand this better. \n\n\nIndia has the highest number of road fatalities in the world. In 2016, the latest year for which global figures are available, India accounted for more than a third of global road accident deaths. The World Health Organization says such deaths are under-reported and estimated that in 2016, the figure for India was likely twice as big as that reported by the government. \n\nSee: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/roadways/indian-roads-fatalities-in-mishaps-high-despite-better-construction-and-use-of-tech/articleshow/68443824.cms?from=mdr\n\nThe paper titles **Road Traffic Accidents in India: Issues and Challenges** by Sanjay Kumar Singh* Professor of Economics at the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow, India has some very interesting insights states the below \n\n> Fatalities and injuries resulting from road traffic accidents are a major and growing public health problem in India.\n> Every week nearly 2,650 people get killed and 9,000 get injured due to traffic accidents. In 2013, latest year for which\n> data is available, 137,423 people died and 469,900 people got injured due to road accidents in India. Traffic accidents have now earned India a dubious distinction; with nearly 140,000 deaths annually, the country has overtaken China to\n> top the world in road fatalities. India is the only country in the world which faces more than 15 fatalities and 53 injuries\n> every hour as a consequence of road crashes. While in many developed and developing countries including China, the\n> situation is generally improving, India faces a worsening situation. If the trend continues, the total number of road\n> traffic deaths in India would increase by 100% between 2013 and 2027.\n> \nPaper: https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S2352146517307913?token=4ADB32DF3CEE92D8574B34132B92AB053E9FF54072488412F0EDF74F8C2D58C26454142A35C0019B572A0E79AB021BC6\n\n\nThe paper uses tthes Accidental Deaths & Suicides in India, 1970 to 2013 published by the National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi data for its study. \n\nSince we have the no. of deaths and injuries, let us look at them first."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing Relevant Libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import

The share of paved roads in our road network has increased from half in March 2008 to nearly two-thirds in March 2016, according to the latest available figures. India has a road network of 5.6 million km, of which national highways contribute just 2% and state highways 3%. Rural roads account for the lion’s share, at 70%.\n\n\nThis zone-wise and state-wise comparison from two data sources eventually conclude on the same point that TN leads in Southern Zone with the most of people killed or injured in road accidents.\n\n\nLet's perform a similar analysis for Northen Zone to check for UP. \n\n# Northern-Zone States: No. of Road Accidents where People were Killed"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sub_df = killed_df[killed_df['Zones'] == 'North Zone']\ndf =pd.pivot_table(sub_df, index=['States/UTs'],values=[2014, 2015, 2016, 2017],aggfunc=np.sum).reset_index()\ndf\n\nyears = [2014,2015,2016,2017]\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(20,10))\nfor i,year in enumerate(years):\n    sns.barplot(x=df['States/UTs'],y=df[year])\n    plt.ylabel('# of People Killed in Road Accidents')\n    plt.title('Northern State Wise No. of Road Accidents where People were Killed', fontsize=15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Northern-Zone States: No. of Road Accidents where People were Injured"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sub_df = injured_df[injured_df['Zones'] == 'North Zone']\ndf =pd.pivot_table(sub_df, index=['States/UTs'],values=[2014, 2015, 2016, 2017],aggfunc=np.sum).reset_index()\ndf\n\nyears = [2014,2015,2016,2017]\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(20,10))\nfor i,year in enumerate(years):\n    sns.barplot(x=df['States/UTs'],y=df[year])\n    plt.ylabel('# of People Injured in Road Accidents')\n    plt.title('Northern State Wise No. of Road Accidents where People were Injured', fontsize=15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The top three states in the northern zone are Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi for most number of kills/injuries in road accidents.\n\n# Weather Conditions - No. of People Killed in Road Accidents (North Zone)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sub_df = weather_df_killed[weather_df_killed['Zones'] == 'North Zone']\ndf =pd.pivot_table(sub_df, index=['Zones'],aggfunc=np.sum).reset_index()\ndf = df.T.reset_index()\ndf = df.rename(columns = {'index': 'Weather Conditions', 0: 'Total'})\ndf = df.drop(df.index[0])\ndf = df.sort_values(by = ['Total'], ascending=False).head(10)\ndf\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(20,10))\nsns.barplot(x=df['Weather Conditions'],y=df['Total'])\nplt.ylabel('# of People Killed')\nplt.title('Northern Zone No. of People Killed in Road Accidents Based on Weather', fontsize=15)\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sub_df = weather_df_killed[weather_df_killed['Zones'] == 'North Zone']\ndf =pd.pivot_table(sub_df, index=['States/UTs'],aggfunc=np.sum).reset_index()\ndf = df.reset_index()\ncols = list(df.columns[5:18])\ndf = df.sort_values(by=cols, ascending=False).head(7)\n\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(20,10))\nfor i,reason in enumerate(cols):\n    sns.lineplot(x=df['States/UTs'],y=df[reason], label=cols[i])\n    plt.ylabel('# of People Killed in Accidents')\n    plt.title('Statewise No. of Accidents where People were Killed and Weather Conditions', fontsize=15)\n    plt.legend(loc='upper left')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The same pattern for weather continues for the northern states as well.
