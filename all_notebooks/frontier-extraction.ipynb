The key to perform this is to consider the images as sets and not as arrays. The next step is to perform an erosion, a morphological operation that has the effect of *\"making smaller\"* the objects in the scene, as it can be seen in the example below.  \n\n![Erosion](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/figs/erodbin.gif)  \n\nThis is acheived by passing a structuring element through the scene. A structuring element is an array, usually of small dimensions (for example, 3x3), which has binary values and a defined center. When all the values in the array coincide with the values in the scene the only value you leave in the resulting scene is the center of the structuring element. To make this clear here is an example of performing erosion on a 2 with a cross structuring element.\n\n![Erosion example se](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305375221/figure/fig1/AS:393507714945026@1470830958326/The-erosion-of-an-object-by-a-structuring-element.png)\n\nNow that we know what erosion is the idea comes quickly, if you perform a (set) difference between the original image and the eroded image we can easily see that the result is going to be the frontier of the original image. Let's not show examples yet, let's implement it and check wether this is true or not.  \n\nThis is easy to implement and easier now that skimage gives us all the tools we need."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test = data_binary[0,:,:]\ntest_eroded = erosion(test, diamond(1))\nfrontier = np.copy(test)\n\nfor i in range(28):\n    for j in range(28):\n        if(test[i,j] != test_eroded[i,j]):\n            frontier[i,j] = 1\n        \n        else:\n            frontier[i,j] = 0\n            \nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize = (20, 10))\nax[0].imshow(test, cmap = 'binary')\nax[0].set_title(\"Orignal\")\n\nax[1].imshow(test_eroded, cmap = 'binary')\nax[1].set_title(\"Eroded\")\n\nax[2].imshow(frontier, cmap = 'binary')\nax[2].set_title(\"Frontier (Original - Eroded)\")\n\nplt.show()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that the reasoning was right!
