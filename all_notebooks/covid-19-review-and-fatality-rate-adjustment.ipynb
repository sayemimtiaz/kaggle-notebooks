Therefore, most of the country-wise comparisons might be inappropriate; country dynamics might be more useful\n* The data shows a very high number of deaths in Italy, but this could be result of many factors - aged population, pre-existing medical conditions (comorbidities) of infected people, high antibiotic resistance of the population (highest in the EU), as well as using too conservative methodology of classifying the victims of SARS-CoV-2\n* The data for the new confirmed cases in China since early February seems to be unreliable\n* The most popular approach to calculate the fatality rate as death cases divided by total confirmed cases is ***misleading and deflates the real rate***. It would have been correct only at the end of the epidemic period. There is a lag (assuming of about 7 days on average) between the case confirmation and the death, therefore the real fatality rate should compare ***today's death cases to the total confirmed from 7 days ago***.\n* Several countries from Middle East, South Africa and Far East have reported high recovery rates\n* There is some slight evidence about positive effect of imposing national quarantine, but this is something difficult to be measured (long length and high standard deviation of the incubation period means a lag between the quarantine date and the first evident effects; also it's more than clear that the measures are definitely helping to stop the spread of the disease)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input daty_chinaa files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.io as pio\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\npio.templates.default = \"plotly\"\nimport datetime\n\nfrom IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell\nInteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = \"all\"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/covid_19_data.csv\", parse_dates = ['ObservationDate'])\ndata.head()\ndata.info()\ndata.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['ObservationDate'] = data['ObservationDate'].apply(lambda x: x.date())\ndata = data.sort_values(by=['ObservationDate','Country/Region'])\ndata.rename(columns={'ObservationDate':'Date', 'Province/State':'Province', 'Country/Region':'Country', 'Deaths':'Death'}, inplace=True)\ndata['Active'] = data.Confirmed - data.Death - data.Recovered\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"First entry: {data.Date.min()}\")\nprint(f\"Last entry: {data.Date.max()}\")\nprint(f\"Time length: {data.Date.max() - data.Date.min()}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dynamics of cases over time"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"features = ['Confirmed', 'Active', 'Death', 'Recovered']\ntotals = data.groupby('Date')[features].sum().reset_index()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure().add_trace(go.Scatter(x=totals.Date, y=totals.Confirmed, mode='lines', name='Confirmed'))\\\n    .add_trace(go.Scatter(x=totals.Date, y=totals.Death, mode='lines', name='Deaths'))\\\n    .add_trace(go.Scatter(x=totals.Date, y=totals.Recovered, mode='lines', name='Recovered'))\\\n    .add_trace(go.Scatter(x=totals.Date, y=totals.Active, mode='lines', name='Active'))\\\n.update_layout(title='Cases over time')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In February, the number of active cases slowed the tempo and even began to decrease in the second half of the month, mainly due to the increasing number of recoveries in China.\nAfter 5th March, however, the disease spreads almost all over the world.\n\nAlthough the spread of the desease is currently having momentum higher than ever, let's take a closer look at the recoveries and death cases dynamic."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_nochina = data[data.Country!='Mainland China'].groupby('Date')[features].sum().reset_index()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"go.Figure().add_scatter(x=data_nochina.Date, y=data_nochina.Death, mode='lines', name='Deaths', line=dict(color='black'))\\\n.add_scatter(x=data_nochina.Date, y=data_nochina.Recovered, mode='lines', name='Recovered', line=dict(color='green'))\\\n.update_layout(title='Deaths vs Recoveries (excl.

However, this would be correct only when the epidemic period is ended. It doesn't take into account the current infected patients and the length of the whole process - from the infection, through the incubation period, then the first received symptoms and finally - the death. Therefore, **most of the official statistics about the fatality rate are incorrect as they naively deflate the real fatality rate**.\n\nAs it's believed that the detection tests are only effective after the incubation period, we can then assume that a case confirmation comes when the first symptoms appear. Therefore, we should take into account the time between the first symptom and the death, which varies greatly, but according to [this source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/) is about 7 days on average. Therefore, to calculate the fatality rate, we will **take the latest death cases figures and divide them by the total confirmed cases from 7 days ago**. This will cover the period when the infection develops and we'll assume that the victims will not die in less than 7 days after their first symptoms.\n\nEven this correction might not be enough - similar approach is suggested by the medical science journal [The Lancet](http://tiny.cc/7u78lz), where the suggested correction is even more conservative and goes up to 14 days. However, it is only a month past the first serious increase in number of cases globally, so it wouldn't allow us to analyze how the fatality rate changes over time for more than a few countries. Therefore, we'll use the 7-days approach, although not being the most precise one. Also, due to the high volatility in day-to-day confirmed/death/recovered cases, we will not use the daily values, but the cummulative figures.\n\n\nAnother important note - the comparison of rate by country is difficult and sometimes not appropriate due to several reasons listed by the [Centre of evidence-based medicine](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/):\n* The number of cases detected by testing will vary considerably by country;\n* The selection bias varies - there are countries where severe disease are preferentially tested, while other people won't be tested, hence they would stay out of the official statistics;\n* There may be delays between symptoms onset and deaths  which  can lead to underestimation of the CFR;\n* There may be factors that account for increased death rates such  as coinfection, more inadequate healthcare, patient demographics (i.e., older patients might be more prevalent in countries such as Italy);\n* There may be increased rates of smoking or comorbidities amongst the fatalities.\n* Differences in how deaths are attributed to Coronavirus: dying with the disease (association) is not the same as dying from the disease (causation).\n\nDue to these factors, more appropriate would be to just focus on the volatility of rates for a single country and avoid comparing one country to another."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_noprovinces['Death_rate'] = 100*data_noprovinces['Death'] / data_noprovinces['Confirmed']\ndata_noprovinces['Recovery_rate'] = 100*data_noprovinces['Recovered'] / data_noprovinces['Confirmed']\ndata_noprovinces['Active_rate'] = 100*data_noprovinces['Active'] / data_noprovinces['Confirmed']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from datetime import timedelta\nfrom datetime import date\n\ncountries10plusdeaths = data_noprovinces.loc[\n    data_noprovinces.Country.isin(\n        data_noprovinces.loc[data_noprovinces.Death > 10, 'Country']) &  (data_noprovinces.Country != 'Diamond Princess'),'Country'].unique()\nfatality_adj_list = []\nfor country in countries10plusdeaths:\n    for i in reversed(range(21)):\n        step = []\n        step.append(country)\n        step.append(data_noprovinces.loc[(data_noprovinces.Date == data_noprovinces.Date.max() -

People are taking antibiotics by their own decision when feeling ill, often not completing a full 5-days course. We all are getting antibiotics in small quantities when we don't really need them, so the bacterias are getting used to this and in some point they become antibiotic-resistant.

period.\n\nAs shown above, the imposing of quarantine had no immediate impact on the number of confirmed cases. In some countries (Spain, France, Belgium) there was an increase in the growth of the confirmed cases, but this can be easily explained - the long incubation period (up to 2 weeks) means that the cases that were confirmed shortly after the quarantine date have actually been infected at some point before that date. Therefore, the impact of the quarantine should become evident about 2 weeks later - and indeed, it can be seen on the logarithmic scale above that the lines for most of the countries are not as \"straight\" as they were before and are very slowly starting to decrease - meaning that the exponential increase has been slightly interrupted."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
