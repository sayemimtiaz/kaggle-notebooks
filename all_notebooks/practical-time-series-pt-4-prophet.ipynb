While fairly easy to setup, they have their challenges:\n* exponential smoothing can only handle one seasonal pattern at at time\n* ARIMA fails to capture changes in the trend - unless the trend is a monotone polynomial, it is difficult to model accurately within this framework\n\nChallenges like these led to the development of Prophet, which is a time series framework designed to work out of the box. The core idea is based around the structural decomposition:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nX_t = T_t + S_t + H_t + \\epsilon_t\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere\n* $T_t$ : trend component\n* $S_t$ : seasonal component (weekly, yearly)\n* $H_t$ : deterministic irregular component (holidays)\n* $\\epsilon_t$: noise \n\nWe will discuss the Prophet style of modeling trend, seasonality and holidays in the sections below, but first a crash intro to the theory behind the models. \n\n## Generalized Additive Models (GAM)\n\nModels like ARIMA rely on correlation between observations from nearby timestamps - an alternative approach is to train the model on overall trends combined with seasonal effects; prediction from such a model is built using combination of smooth functions. Core underlying mathematical result is the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem: multivariate function could be represented as sums and compositions of univariate functions:\n\n\\begin{equation} \n    {\\displaystyle f({x_1, \\ldots, x_n})=\\sum _{q=0}^{2n}\\Phi _{q}\\left(\\sum _{p=1}^{n}\\phi _{q,p}(x_{p})\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe theorem has no constructive proof suitable for modeling $\\implies$ simplification is necessary: \n\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\displaystyle f({x_1, \\ldots, x_n})=\\Phi \\left(\\sum _{p=1}^{n}\\phi _{p}(x_{p})\\right)}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\Phi$ is a smooth monotonic function. \n\nA familiar variant of this approach is the class of Generalized Linear Models :\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Phi^{-1}\\left[\\operatorname {E}(Y)\\right]=\\beta _{0}+f_{1}(x_{1})+f_{2}(x_{2})+\\cdots +f_{m}(x_{m}).\\,\\!\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe smooth functions in the context of Prophet are the trend, seasonal and holiday components - we can isolate each individual function and evaluate its effect in prediction, which makes such models easier to interpret. we estimate through backfitting algorithm $\\rightarrow$ convergence\n\n## The prophetic core\n\nSo how does that work in practice? We take a GAM-style decomposition as our starting point:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nX_t = T(t) + S(t) + H(t) + \\epsilon_t\n\\end{equation}\n\nUnpacking the equation: \n\n* time is the only regressor\n\n* easy accomodation of new components\n\n* multiple seasonal patterns $\\rightarrow$ extension of double exponential smoothing\n\n* forecasting $\\rightarrow$ curve fitting\n\n* no need for regular spacing $\\implies$ no NA filling\n\n* fast fitting with backfitting algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backfitting_algorithm\n\n* probabilistic aspects - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\n\n* works in more general cases, but \"designed\" for daily data\n\n\n\nBelow we discuss each of the components in its own section.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.04359,"end_time":"2021-08-24T18:29:56.314887","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-08-24T18:29:56.271297","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-two\"></a>\n# Trend model\n\nThe Prophet library implements two possible trend models.\n\n\n## Linear Trend\n\nThe first, default trend model is a simple Piecewise Linear Model with a constant rate of growth.
