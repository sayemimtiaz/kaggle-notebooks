This means that the data is focused on the observed traits of animals brought into the care of Vancouver Animal Control.\n## Data  Frame Modification Methodology\nWhere appropriate, the names of categorical entries have been changed for the sake of making the data more understandable.\n## Figure Format Methodology\nSome columns in this dataset are intended to be categorical, but have so many different categories that they cannot be succinctly displayed in a single figure without doing some kind of grouping. In the case of these columns, I have (somewhat arbitrarily) decided that only the eight most relevant categories will be shown in any figure. Similarly, if there is a categorical variable that only has a few valid categories, but there are many data-entry errors in the dataset, I will only display the valid categories in the figure.\n## Imports, Styling, and Loading the Dataset"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#Matplotlib styling\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.rcParams[\"axes.titlesize\"] = 30\nplt.rcParams[\"axes.labelsize\"] = 22\nplt.rcParams[\"xtick.labelsize\"] = 18\nplt.rcParams[\"ytick.labelsize\"] = 18\n\n#reading in datafile and set the index to the AnimalID column\ndf1 = pd.read_csv(\"../input/city-of-vancouver-animal-control-register/Vancouver-animal-control-inventory-register.csv\", sep = ';', header = 'infer')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Global Data Cleaning"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#convert all of the strings in the datafile to lowercase\ndf1 = df1.applymap(lambda s:s.lower() if type(s) == str else s)\n\n#remove colums that contain human information, and administrative information as this overview is with inherent qualities and outcomes\ndf1 = df1.drop(['ACO','ReceiptNumber','PitNumber','ShotsDate','AnimalID','KennelNumber','EnteredBy','Name','DispositionDate','DateImpounded'], axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Figures and Observations"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#figure1\n#Drop rows where sex = x, and represent sex character codes in a more undertandable way\ndfSex = df1.copy()\ndfSex = dfSex[(dfSex.Sex != 'x')]\ndfSex['Sex'] = dfSex['Sex'].replace({'m':'male non-neutered','m/n':'male neutered','f':'female non-spayed','f/s':'female spayed'})\n\nfig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 2, gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [7, 3]},figsize=(21, 5)) \nsns.countplot(x='Sex', data=dfSex, order = dfSex['Sex'].value_counts().index, ax=axarr[0])\naxarr[0].set_title(\"Animal Sex and Neuter/Spay Status\")\n\ndf1['Age category'].value_counts().plot(kind='pie', ax=axarr[1], )\naxarr[1].set_title(\"Animal Age Catagory\")\naxarr[1].axes.yaxis.set_visible(False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Sex\nThe majority of the entries (whether neutered or not) are male.

The original data frame has categories encoded mainly as 'green', 'yellow', and 'blue', which represent 'easy', 'moderate', and 'challenging', respectively. There are however a good number of in-between values (ex: 'green/yellow') and incorrectly entered values (ex: 'yel').

With that in mind though, this dataset has an issue with data entry quality. Some of this can likely be mitigated with data cleaning and re-engineering, however the original creators of this dataset would benefit from switching from a typed-entry system to a selected-entry field for many of the categorical variables. Similarly, a standard should be established around whether metric or imperial weights are to be used when doing data entry, and entries for the 'ApproxWeight' field should be numeric.  \n\nWhile there are many rows with NAN values, the dataset is sufficiently large enough to do a regression analysis despite that, and it may be possible to make some predictions with a random forest algorithm, or a neural network, which I will likely attempt in another notebook."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
