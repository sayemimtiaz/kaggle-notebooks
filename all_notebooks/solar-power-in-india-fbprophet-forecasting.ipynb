environmental conditions. Plant 2 operates in a higher ambient temperature on average, which may put a strain on the equipment, perhap explaining some of it's unusual fluctuations in TOTAL_YIELD\n- Using forecasting methods it should definitely be possible to predict likely power outputs for the following week from data such as this. In order to capture larger seasonal trends over the course of a year, one would need a few years worth of training data (ideally though one year might do). fbprophet is a great library for quick and easy time-series forecasting\n- Anomaly detection systems can be built from various time series models, provided the models generate confidence intervals which may be use for setting meaningful thresholds. Many approaches exist to capturing the normal trend and variation of the time series and outputting confidence intervals for anomaly detection but the fbprophet one seems to do the job here, given that we have daily/weekly trended data. The sensitivity of any anomaly detection system may be arbitrarily tuned to define \"anomalous\" data points as being more or less dramatically different from the normal time series trend and this requires some domain knowledge of the system to setup","metadata":{}}]}
