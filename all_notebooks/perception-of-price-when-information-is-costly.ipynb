In this paper, Shin uses some really elegant regression modelling to try to determine whether consumers make decision on electricity consumption, based on their marginal price (ei the price for their next unit under a progressive block pricing schedule) or based on their average price over their units consumed.  \n  \nFor businesses and policy makers this can provide crucial insight into the efficacy of different pricing policies in changing consumer behaviour.  In water and electricity consumption this can be critical in ensuring equitible consumption and in ensuring the sustainability of the energy or water supplier.  For economist researching demand, modelling consumer behaviour is critical.  Typically, when economists think about consumer behaviour they are interested in how income, price and the price of substitutes affect demand.  To investigate these affects they look to the idea of elasticity- how do changes in price and income affect changes demand.  For Shin, the primary interest for whether changes in average price or changes in marginal price affected changes in demand.  To do this he used a regression model.  \n\nTo investigate this elasticity of price and income, economists typically apply a log transform to their endogenous variables (like quantity) and exogenous variables (like price and incomes) to approximate this idea of percent change. In Shin's paper, he defines the following model:\n  \n$ln(\\textit{units of demand}) = \\beta_1 ln(\\textit{income}) + \\beta_2 ln(\\textit{units of demand at a previous timestep}) + \\beta_3 ln(\\textit{marginal price}) + \\beta_4 ln(\\frac{\\textit{average price}}{\\textit{marginal price}}) + ... +\\beta_0$\n\nUsing this model, he not only analyze the elasticity of margin price and income but, using $\\beta_4$, whether consumers make decisions based on averaeg price or marginal price.  Using this model, if $\\beta_4$ is positive consumers make decisions based on average price and if $\\beta_4$ is negative then their is evidence that consumers use merginal price.   \nThe major challenge in using the AguaH dataset is mainly that I could not find a real block-pricing schedule for period over which the data was collected.  I managed to track down the current Block Pricing Schedule, with some help but was unable to find the historic schedule on Internet Archive. This will force us to asssume that these are Real Prices and that the structure of the schedules have not changed over time but instead moved in lock-step inline with wages and inflation. \n  \n[1] http://aguadehermosillo.gob.mx/aguah/tarifas/ accessed 20 March 2020  \n[2] Shin, J.S., 1985.
