Introduction\nPredicting the price of a house is useful for both the seller and buyer. \nThe seller wants to ensure they are not under or overvaluing the house, as that could lead to missed profit or no interest from buyers. \nConversely, buyers will be interested in predicting a house price to see if they are getting a good deal on an undervalued house or if they are getting ripped off. \nThis dataset offers an opportunity to utilise multiple linear regression and tree-based methods to predict the prices of houses in King County, which includes Seattle, in the state of Washington. \nThese house prices are from May 2014 to May 2015. \n\nThis is the python equivalent to my previous analysis that I did in R.

It does this by fitting a least squares regression for each possible combination of predictors - e.g. all of the models with only one of the predictors, all of the models with all of the combinations of two predictors, and so on. So, how do you determine what the ‘best’ model is? The most robust method is to validate each model under consideration and I will be using *k*-fold cross-validation.\n\nIn *k*-fold cross-validation the data you have is split into *k* folds (of approximately equal size) - essentially subsets of your data. For example, let’s assume *k* = 10. Your model would be trained on nine of the 10 folds and tested on the remaining fold. The **mean squared error** (MSE) is calculated from the test on the held-out fold - this is a value for how close your models predictions are to the true values, so a *low* MSE indicates a more accurate model. Then, a different fold is chosen to be tested on, and your model is trained using the remaining nine folds. This continues until your model has been tested on each of the *k* folds, and the MSEs are averaged. This approach is repeated for each model under consideration.\n\nThe ‘best’ model is the one that has lowest MSE - that model has consistently been the most accurace across the validation process. I will be looking at many approaches to predicting the price of a house, so I have created a matrix to track the test MSE for each of these approaches.\n\nSo, let’s perform best subset selection using *k*-fold cross-validation, where *k* = 10:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# this takes about three hours to run on kaggle and it doesn't fully complete and nothing else works after it\n# error message:\n# Features: 130402/131071IOPub message rate exceeded.\n# The notebook server will temporarily stop sending output\n# to the client in order to avoid crashing it.\n# To change this limit, set the config variable\n# `--NotebookApp.iopub_msg_rate_limit`.\n\n# Current values:\n# NotebookApp.iopub_msg_rate_limit=1000.0 (msgs/sec)\n# NotebookApp.rate_limit_window=3.0 (secs)\n\n\n# So, I will just put the test MSE that I got from my own computer, but if you want to repeat this the code is below\n\n# EFS will consider every possible combination of features\n# the 'best' number of features is determined by 10-fold cross-validation,\n# the mean squared error on the held-out fold\n#lm = LinearRegression()\n#efs = EFS(lm, min_features = 1, max_features = 17, \n          #scoring = 'neg_mean_squared_error', cv = 10)\n\n# fit to training data\n#efs.fit(x_train, y_train)\n#efs.best_feature_names_\n# 16 features selected, only 'long' was not selected\n\n# use the selected features to predict values in test set\n#x_train_efs = efs.transform(x_train)\n#x_test_efs = efs.transform(x_test)\n#lm_house = lm.fit(x_train_efs, y_train)\n#y_pred = lm_house.predict(x_test_efs)\n\nlm_test_MSE = 0.06351712398582668\nbest_feature_names_ = ('bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', \n                           'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'waterfront', 'view', \n                           'condition', 'grade', 'sqft_above', 'sqft_basement', \n                           'yr_built', 'yr_renovated', 'lat', 'sqft_living15', 'sqft_lot15')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Test set MSE: %.5f' % lm_test_MSE)\nprint('Number of features chosen:', len(best_feature_names_))\nprint('Features chosen:', best_feature_names_)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So, cross-validation has chosen a **16 variable** model.

In this approach, you start with a model with no predictors. Then, you add one variable to the model - the variable that results in the best reduction in RSS or increase in R<sup>2</sup>. This continues until you have all of the predictors in the model. Cross-validation is used here too - the process of adding variables takes place on the training folds and the model is tested on the held-out fold.\n\nHowever, forward stepwise selection may not necessarily select the most optimal combination of predictors at each level. Consider a dataset with predictors a, b, and c, where the best one variable model is with predictor a and the best two variable model is with predictors b and c. Best subset selection would find this combination, but forward stepwise selection wouldn’t, because it has to choose predictor a for the first model and it builds on its previous selections.\n\nThe obvious question is then: why choose forward stepwise selection over best subset selection? The answer is that forward stepwise selection is faster than best subset selection. Best subset selection has to consider 2<sup>p</sup> models, where *p* equals the number of predictors, but forward stepwise selection considers 1+*p*(*p*+1)/2 models.\n\nLet’s see how forward stepwise selection performs:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Forward stepwise selection\n# taken and adapted from:\n# http://www.science.smith.edu/~jcrouser/SDS293/labs/lab9-py.html\n\n# using 10-fold cross-validation, so set that up first\nk = 10\nnp.random.seed(seed = 35) # set seed to ensure reproducibility\nfolds = np.random.choice(k, size = len(y), replace = True)\n\n# dataframe to track cross-validation errors\ncrossVal_errors_fwd = pd.DataFrame(\n    columns = range(1, k + 1),\n    index = range(1, 18))\n\n# function to fit a linear model\ndef processSubset(features, X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test):\n    # fit to training set\n    model = sm.OLS(Y_train, X_train[list(features)])\n    model_fit = model.fit()\n    \n    # calculate test set MSE by using the fitted model to make predictions on \n    # the test set\n    predictions = model_fit.predict(X_test[list(features)])\n    test_MSE = np.mean((Y_test.subtract(predictions, axis = 0))**2)\n    test_MSE = test_MSE.tolist()\n\n    return {'Model': model_fit, 'Test MSE': test_MSE}\n\n# function to perform forward stepwise selection\ndef forward_stepwise_selection(predictors, X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test):\n    results = [] # empty for now\n    \n    # extract predictors that still need to be checked\n    # checks if each predictor in x_train is also not in predictors\n    remaining_predictors = [p for p in X_train.columns if p not in predictors]\n    \n    # for each of the remaining predictors\n    for p in remaining_predictors:\n        \n        # call processSubset to fit a linear model using predictors + each\n        # of the remaining predicotrs\n        results.append(processSubset(predictors + [p], \n                                     X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test))\n        \n    # turn results into a dataframe\n    models = pd.DataFrame(results)\n    \n    # choose the best model (with the lowest test set MSE)    \n    models.sort_values('Test MSE', inplace = True, axis = 0)\n    best_model = models[:1]\n\n    return best_model\n    \n# now write a for loop performing cross-validation\n# in the ith fold, the elements of folds that equal i are in the test set and \n# the remainder are in the training\n# dataframe to track the cross_validation errors for each model size\nmodels_crossVal_errors_fwd = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['Model', 'Test MSE'])\n\n# iterate over each fold\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    \n    # reset predictors\n    predictors = []\n    \n    # iterate over each model size\n    for j in range(1, len(x.columns) + 1):\n        \n        # create train sets using all but fold i and test sets using the\n        # remaining fold i\n        x_train = x[folds != (i -

Ridge regression is an approach that uses all predictors, but it shrinks the coefficent estimates (intercept and slope) towards zero which reduces their variance. Ridge regression does seek to minimise RSS (like least squares) but it introduces another term called a **shrinkage penalty**. The tuning paramter (*lambda*, λ) controls the impact of both terms.\n\nWhen λ = 0, the shrinkage penalty is not in effect, so ridge regression is just performing least squares. As λ increases, the shrinkage penalty grows and the coefficients approach zero. When λ is extremely large, the coefficients will be essentially zero (but never exactly) - leading to a null model with no predictors. How do you select a good value of λ?\nCross-validation!\n\nYou can create a grid of λ values, then use 10-fold cross-validation to train a ridge regression model for every value of λ in the grid.

However, where bagging considers every variable when making a split, a random forest only considers a *random subset* of the predictors. This may sound counter-intuitive - why would you not want to consider every variable at each split?\n\nIf you have one very strong predictor, it is highly likely that in bagging this variable will be responsible for the first split in almost every tree - therefore the trees will look quite similar and the predictions from them will be highly correlated. Even by averaging these correlated predictions, the variance reduction is not as large as averaging uncorrelated predctions. This is where random forest steps in - by considering a (random) subset of predictors at each split, the trees will be *decorrelated* where all predictors are given more of a chance.\n\nThe number of predictors in each subset is therefore a factor to consider, but I will use the default value is this analysis, which is five in this case.\n\nBy using a subset of predictors at each split, you can determine which variables are more important in predicting the response:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# growing a random forest is similar, but a lower value of mtry is used\n# a value of 5 is used here, the same number I used in R\nrf_model = RandomForestRegressor(max_features = 5, random_state = 35)\n# fit to training data\nrf_model.fit(x_train, y_train.values.ravel())\n\n# extract importance of each variable\nrf_var_importance = pd.DataFrame({'Importance': rf_model.feature_importances_}, \n                                 index = x_train.columns)\n\n# plot\nplot_rf_var_importance_theme = theme(axis_title = element_text(size = 12.5),\n                                     axis_text = element_text(size = 10))\nplot_rf_var_importance = (ggplot(data = rf_var_importance,\n                                 mapping = aes(x = rf_var_importance.index,\n                                               y = rf_var_importance)) +\n  geom_col() + # plot bars\n  theme_classic() + # white background, no gridlines\n  xlab('Variable') + # change x axis label\n  ylab('Importance of Variable') + # change y axis label\n  plot_rf_var_importance_theme + # change the size of axis titles and axis text\n  coord_flip() # flips to put variables on y axis, improving readability\n  )\nplot_rf_var_importance","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The plot shows that latitude is by far the most important variable with the grade of the house and the square footage of the living area rounding out the top tree.\n\nThat’s all well and good, but is random forest an improvement over bagging?","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# make predictions using test data\nrf_predict = rf_model.predict(x_test)\n# calculate test set MSE\nrf_test_set_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, rf_predict)\nprint(rf_test_set_mse)\n\n# add test MSE to matrix\nmodel_stats.loc['Random forest', 'Test MSE'] = rf_test_set_mse","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Random forest is slightly worse than bagging but is still far superior to the linear model approaches.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.4 Boosting\n\nIn boosting, trees are grown slowly using information from previously grown trees, unlike bagging where trees are grown independently. Boosting does not utilse bootstrap sampling.\n\nThere are a number of parameters that can be changed to tune the performance:\n1. The shrinkage paramater (λ) - this is the rate at which boosting learns\n2. The depth of the tree\n3. The minimum number of observations needed in a node\n4. The ‘bag.fraction’ paramater allowing stochastic gradient descent. In this approach, there is a global minimum of the loss function. If the loss function is U-shaped, it is not that difficult to find that minimum. However, if it shaped differently, the global minimum might be behind multiple local minimums which the algorithm would normally stop at. Stochastic gradient descent means a subset of the training data is used to grow a tree, a different subset for the bext tree, and so on. This increases the speed of running this algorithm, and while it doesn’t guarantee the global minimum can be found it does make it more likely that local minimums and plateaus can be overcome.\n\nTherefore, I will use a number of different values for each parameter:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# create a dictionary for the different values for the different parameters\nparameters = {'Learning rate': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1],\n              'Depth': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n              'Min.

The best models were the remaining tree-based methods, boosting is the best model with a notable improvement over second-placed random forest and a substantial decrease in test MSE compared to the worst models.\n\nThe tree-based approaches also highlighted that latitude was the most significant predictor, followed by the square footage of the house and the grade of the house, and to a lesser extent longitude.
