With CORD-19 abstracts, we use real-time question answering model called DenSPI (Seo et al., 2019) and biomedical entity search engine called BEST (Lee et al., 2016) for fast retrieval of fine-grained answers such as phrases and entities. We also provide biomedical named entities extracted by [BioBERT](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert). \n\ncovidAsk is open-sourced at https://github.com/dmis-lab/covidAsk.
