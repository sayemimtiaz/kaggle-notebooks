He did so not in a hospital in his hometown of Motherwell, but in Vietnam's sprawling and hectic Ho Chi Minh City, with no close friends or family for thousands of miles.\n\nCameron, the `LAST Covid-19 patient in an intensive care unit in Vietnam`, has been the sickest doctors have had to deal with during the outbreak. \nThe country, home to 95 million people, has seen only a few hundred confirmed cases, single-digit ICU admissions and not a single recorded death. So rare was a case of Cameron's severity in Vietnam, every minute detail of his recovery was reported in national newspapers and on TV news bulletins.\n\nHe's now known nationwide as `Patient 91`, the moniker given to him by public health officials when he fell ill in March. \n\"I'm very humbled by how I've been taken into the hearts of the Vietnamese people,\" says Cameron, speaking exclusively to the BBC. \"And most of all I'm grateful for the bloody-mindedness of the doctors in not wanting me to die on their watch.\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53196009","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://thesmartlocal.com/vietnam/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vietnam-covid-19-update.jpg)\nthesmartlocal.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<iframe width=\"727\" height=\"409\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqx19f0ceUo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Coronavirus: Vietnam's HANDWASHING SONG goes global\n\nAuthorities around the world are trying to hammer home the message that we have to wash our hands to protect against the spread of the new coronavirus.\nIn Vietnam, they've produced a music video along with a dance challenge - the tune has taken the country by storm and has since gone global.\nVideo by Andreas Illmer.https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-51764846/coronavirus-vietnam-s-handwashing-song-goes-global","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ls ../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/VN/","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#\"10 per cent chance of survival\"\n\nDozens of Vietnam's intensive care specialists held regular conference calls to discuss Cameron's condition. \n\"The very small number of critical care patients meant anyone who was severely ill got the attention of all the country's top-level clinicians,\" explains Dr Kidong Park, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative to Vietnam.\n\nFor much of Cameron's two-and-a-half months in a medically induced coma, he depended on an Ecmo machine, a form of life support only used in the most extreme cases, to survive. The machines extract blood from a patient's body and infuse it with oxygen, before pumping it back in.\n\n\"I'm lucky that the only lasting effect seems to be that my legs aren't yet strong enough to hold me, but I'm doing physiotherapy twice a day,\" says Cameron. \"At one point, my friend Craig was told by the Foreign Office I had a 10 per cent chance of survival, so he planned for the worst - he gave up my apartment and started doing things somebody would do if I was coming home in a box.\n\nDoctors had to contend with multiple complications while Cameron was in a coma. His blood became extremely sticky leading to clots.

The Buddha bar cluster, as it became known in the local press, was the single biggest outbreak of coronavirus in south Vietnam, infecting nearly 20 people both indirectly and directly.\n\nDespite there being no proof he was the source of the outbreak, one prominent businessman, Luong Hoai Nam, labelled Patient 91 a \"time bomb\". He called for foreigners breaking the rules to be deported, earning plaudits from his followers on social media\n\n\"There seemed to be a desire to pin it on me coming from abroad, as I did a visa run to Bangkok a week earlier,\" says Cameron, who's convinced he too was infected at the Buddha bar, and was not the source of the outbreak. \n\"I was the first person to put my hands up and say: 'Look I don't feel well'.

He was then comatose for weeks and weeks on end, as doctors agonised over his treatment. Meanwhile, the small number of other ICU patients in Vietnam recovered and went home.\n\nAll the while, his case gained prominence, with top politicians promising to put every effort into keeping him alive, as the hospital temporarily footed the bill for the spiralling costs of his care.\n\n\"There's a lot of political kudos that Vietnam can take from my recovery,\" he observes, \"and it keeps their record, which is pretty phenomenal on Covid, very, very low.\"\n\nProf Khue insists everyone - foreign or Vietnamese - had access to good quality care. \"We focused on treating sick people at the highest level, both in terms of facilities and human resources, regardless of whether they were Vietnamese or from abroad,\" he says\n\nBut he gleefully reports that \"49 out of 50 foreign patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital\".\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53196009","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"vietnam = df[(df['location']=='Vietnam')].reset_index(drop=True)\nvietnam.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Waking up was a 'blur'\n\nWhen Stephen Cameron was first ventilated in early April, there were just over a million cases of coronavirus around the world.

There has not been a recorded case of community transmission since 16 April.\n\n\"I never thought it would take as long as 10 weeks to wake me up.

He's also suffered from severe fatigue and depressive lows since waking up, in addition to the nagging fear that post-traumatic stress could be just around the corner. \n\n\"I've been through a lot mentally.

Progress and pitfalls are faced in equal measure, and it can be dragged out over several years.\n\n#Beating the odds\n\nBut his care hasn't come free. An Ecmo machine costs $5,000-10,000 (£4,000 - £8,000) a day to operate and he was reliant on one for eight-and-a-half weeks. \n\nThe ongoing wrangling over who will cover the costs are causing him stress and diverting attention away from his recovery. At first, the Hospital for Tropical Diseases paid out of its own pocket for his treatment. Then, it seemed the British embassy would intervene. His work insurance eventually covered the cost. But the funds for his stay in Cho Ray Hospital are still up in the air.\n\n\"As he is such a well-known public figure there now, everything about his case is controlled by the government.\"\n\nThe politics of his return are a reminder that the miraculous recovery of Patient 91 is not just a story of a Scottish pilot who recovered from Covid-19 and overcame the odds.

By Anna Jones, BBC News\n\nVietnam enacted measures other countries would take months to move on, bringing in travel restrictions, closely monitoring and eventually closing the border with China and increasing health checks at borders and other vulnerable places. \n\nSchools were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday at the end of January and remained closed until mid-May. A vast and labour intensive contact tracing operation got under way.\n\n\"This is a country that has dealt with a lot of outbreaks in the past,\" says Prof Thwaites, from Sars in 2003 to avian influenza in 2010 and large outbreaks of measles and dengue.\n\n\"The government and population are very, very used to dealing with infectious diseases and are respectful of them, probably far more so than wealthier countries. They know how to respond to these things.\"\n\nBy mid-March, Vietnam was sending everyone who entered the country - and anyone within the country who'd had contact with a confirmed case - to quarantine centres for 14 days.\n\nCosts were mostly covered by the government, though accommodation was not necessarily luxurious. One woman who flew home from Australia - considering Vietnam a safer place to be - told BBC News Vietnamese that on their first night they had \"only one mat, no pillows, no blankets\" and one fan for the hot room. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52628283","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = vietnam['total_tests'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(14, 6))\nax.set_title('Vietnam Total cases per milion/total tests Distribution', size=18)\nax.set_ylabel('total_cases_per_million', size=14)\nax.set_xlabel('total_tests', size=14)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The more you test, the more you reachthe real numbers.
