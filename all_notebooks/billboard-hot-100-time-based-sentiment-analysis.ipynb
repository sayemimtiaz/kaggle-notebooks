becoming more and more obsolete with time, meaning we each year we the listeners prefer a particular song and our preference stays stationary over the list posted through the year.\nAnd the second observation which we will further analyze is the difference between the ranks, i.e., how different are the number 1,2 and 3 places in terms of appearances, a small assumption to we make goes as
