A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.  \n\nCoronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. \n\nCommon signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. \n\nStandard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"32430333-2976-4960-821c-fe8b8485cafc","_cell_guid":"0bda6a32-ce7a-41ff-8302-3ed4dce73b46","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I just want to provide some simple and informative plots regarding the infection spreading over the word"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9f956790-5dfe-4f9d-a43d-fa16f9634ff4","_cell_guid":"3c22dca8-910c-4dd8-a994-6d95b1ff2cfe","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.integrate import odeint\n\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot, init_notebook_mode\nimport math\nimport bokeh \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\n#from urllib.request import urlopen\nimport json\nfrom dateutil import parser\nfrom bokeh.layouts import gridplot\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_file\nfrom bokeh.layouts import row, column\nfrom bokeh.resources import INLINE\nfrom bokeh.io import output_notebook\nfrom bokeh.models import Span\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\noutput_notebook(resources=INLINE)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bd0d2efd-258a-427a-b7f5-98bda8094c33","_cell_guid":"f3a0b30c-fcb6-4767-8571-4327bbdab4ca","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"country_codes = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/countrycodes/countrycodes.csv')\ncountry_codes = country_codes.drop('GDP (BILLIONS)', 1)\ncountry_codes.rename(columns={'COUNTRY': 'Country', 'CODE': 'Code'}, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"059f4202-c7e2-4bfe-9aaf-d214d35ae528","_cell_guid":"a155d797-603a-4fd7-a818-53b2f5753a64","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"virus_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/covid_19_data.csv')\n\nprev_index = 0\nfirst_time = False\ntmp = 0\n\n\nfor i, row in virus_data.iterrows():\n\n    if(virus_data.loc[i,'SNo'] < 1342 and virus_data.loc[i,'Province/State']=='Hubei'):\n        if(first_time):\n            tmp = virus_data.loc[i,'Confirmed']\n            prev_index = i\n            virus_data.loc[i,'Confirmed'] = virus_data.loc[i,'Confirmed'] + 593\n            first_time = False\n        else:\n            increment = virus_data.loc[i,'Confirmed'] - tmp\n            tmp = virus_data.loc[i,'Confirmed']\n            virus_data.loc[i,'Confirmed'] = virus_data.loc[prev_index,'Confirmed'] + increment + 593\n            prev_index = i\n    \n\nvirus_data.rename(columns={'Country/Region': 'Country', 'ObservationDate': 'Date'}, inplace=True)\nvirus_data = virus_data.fillna('unknow')\nvirus_data['Country'] = virus_data['Country'].str.replace('US','United States')\nvirus_data['Country'] = virus_data['Country'].str.replace('UK','United Kingdom') \nvirus_data['Country'] = virus_data['Country'].str.replace('Mainland China','China')\nvirus_data['Country'] = virus_data['Country'].str.replace('South Korea','Korea, South')\nvirus_data['Country'] = virus_data['Country'].str.replace('North Korea','Korea, North')\nvirus_data['Country'] = virus_data['Country'].str.replace('Macau','China')\nvirus_data['Country'] = virus_data['Country'].str.replace('Ivory Coast','Cote d\\'Ivoire')\nvirus_data = pd.merge(virus_data,country_codes,on=['Country'])\nvirus_data.head()\n#print(len(virus_data))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The plot in this [link](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/?location=Australia&location=Canada&location=China&location=France&location=Germany&location=Hong+Kong&location=India&location=Iran&location=Italy&location=Japan&location=South+Korea&location=Spain&location=Turkey&location=US&location=United+Kingdom) shows a comparison between the total number of cases and the number of active cases for some of the main affected countries.

This ratio is useful in order to estimate how the growth of the virus is behaving.

It is important\nto note that R0 is a dimensionless number and not a rate, which would have units of time.\nSome authors incorrectly call R0 the “basic reproductive rate.” R0 is defined as:\n\n$ R_0 = \\tau * \\hat c * d $, \n\nwhere $\\tau$ is the transmissibility (i.e., probability of infection given contact between a susceptible and infected individual), $\\hat c$ is the average rate of contact between susceptible and infected\nindividuals, and d is the duration of infectiousness. d can be obtained as $\\frac{1}{v}$ where $v$ is the recovering rate of a specific population, in our case it is equal to:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"recovered_rate = []\n\nfor i in range(1,len(recovered_ita)):\n    \n    x = list(recovered_ita['dimessi_guariti'])[i]\n    y = list(recovered_ita['dimessi_guariti'])[i-1]\n    if y==0 and x==0:\n        recovered_rate.append(0)\n    elif(y==0):\n        recovered_rate.append(x/x)\n    else:\n        z = (x - y) / x\n        recovered_rate.append(z)\n \nprint('Recovered rate in Italy: ', np.mean(recovered_rate))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The effective contact rate $\\beta$ is equal to $\\tau * \\hat c$.

The SIR system without so-called vital dynamics (birth and death, sometimes called demography) described above can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations\n\n* $\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta I} = - \\frac{\\beta I S}{N}$\n* $\\frac{\\delta I}{\\delta t} = \\frac{\\beta I S}{N} - vI$\n* $\\frac{\\delta R}{\\delta t} =  vI$\n\nFor now, we suppose that the Covid-19 is arrived in Italy with the start of the new year, which is resoneable if we think that the first confirmed case was detected in the end of February and probably many other undetected cases has been passed unobserved. \n\nWe also suppose a reproducibily rate of 1.7, which is in the range of 1.4-2.5.
