Introduction & first ideas:\n\nThis notebook is going to focus on exploratory data analysis and condition monitoring/fault detection (challenges 2&3). However, the employed methods may be useful in combination with data from local weather forecasts for accurate short-term forecasting of power generation (challenge 1).\n\n\n## 1.1 Solar Power Plants\n\nIn general, solar power plants convert energy from sunlight to electricity. The two most prominent technologies are\n- **concentrated solar power**, where focused sunlight is used to heat up an absorber which is then employed to power a steam engine, and \n- **photovoltaic cells**, where the photovoltaic effect (photon absorption leads to injection of excited electrons into the conduction band) is employed to generate direct current (DC) power which is then converted into alternating current (AC) power by the use of inverters.\n\nThe data seems to be from solar power plants that use potovoltaic cell technology.\n\n## 1.2 Dataset Description\nAccording to the dataset description, the data contains two sets of information about two solar power plants located in India, that were acquired over a period of 34 days:\n- power generation data  (measured at the inverter, each inverter corresponding to multiple lines of solar panels)\n- weather data (measured with a single line of sensors optimally placed at the plant)\n\n## 1.3 The challenges\n1. Can we **predict the power generation for next couple of days**? - this allows for better grid management\n2. Can we **identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance**?\n3. Can we **identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment**?\n\n## 1.4 First thoughts and ideas\n- Challenge 1: This challenge belongs to the category of **TIME SERIES FORECASTING**. Three options come to mind:\n\n    1. Use available time series of AC or DC power data\n    2. Use available time series from weather sensors \n    3. Use local weather forecast (external data) and combine with power data\n    \n    Option 1 does not take weather data into account and Option 2 might have difficulties with predicting power drop due to cloud formations since the provided weather data is relatively limited. Option 3 might be more promising since weather forecast stations have more data available (e.g. cloud forecasting). Then the task shifts to predicting power output from forecasted sunlight duration and irradiance.\n- Challenge 2 & 3: These challenges belong the category of **CONDITION MONITORING**, **Anomaly Detection**, and **Fault Detection** and seem identical at first glance. However, performance drop due to need for cleaning/maintenance may be slower and less severe compared with performance drop due to faulty equipment. Therefore, we should be able distinguish between the two.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-two\"></a>\n# 2.

Summary\n\n* **EDA:** Noticed some potential issues with the data: DAILY_YIELD is decreasing on some days even though this should not be possible by definition. Inverters have different number of data points\n\n* **Challenge 1:** Even though this notebook did not focus on forecasting, the power-irradiance models may be helpful in combination with external data from local weather forecasts to predict the generated power for the next couple days.\n\n* **Challenge 2&3:** Successfully identified **events of equipment failure and underperformance** with a rule-based method and linear/nonlinear modeling of the relationship between irradiance, temperature and DC power. This approach can be useful for real-time condition monitoring and fault detection.\n\n### Thank you for reading and please upvote this notebook if you found it useful!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
