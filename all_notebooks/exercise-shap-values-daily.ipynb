You could look it up in a codebook, but without more medical background it wouldn't mean anything to you anyway.\n- A column names like `glimepiride_No` mean the patient did not have the medicine `glimepiride`. If this feature had a value of False, then the patient did take the drug `glimepiride`\n- Features whose names begin with `medical_specialty` describe the specialty of the doctor seeing the patient.
