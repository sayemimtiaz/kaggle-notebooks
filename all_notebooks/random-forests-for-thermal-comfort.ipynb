To answer this, three different random forests will first be developed to identify the most important features of those provided in the dataset. Once the most important features are identified, they will be used in kNN models to predict thermal preference.** One random forest using only person-specific features (e.g. age, sex) as input features will be used to identify the most important person-specific features for predicting thermal preference. A second random forest using non-person-specific features (e.g. season, city, heating strategy) will be used to identify the most important non-person-specific features for predicting thermal preference. A third random forest using both person-specific and non-person-specific features will be used to identify the most important features for predicting thermal preference. For this final random forest, we will develop two kNN models predicting thermal preference (multi-class classification) and compare their performance. One kNN model will use all features and the other kNN model will use only the most important features as identified by this final random forest. **By the end of this notebook, we'll know which features are most important for predicting thermal preference and we will have the accuracy of a model predicting thermal preference using these most important features.**\n\n## Concepts used\n- One-hot encoding categorical data\n- Train/test split\n- Random forest for feature selection \n- kNN for multi-class classification\n- Standardizing feature values\n\nExplanations of each of these concepts are not provided in this notebook.\n\n\n# Data Wrangling, Encoding categorical features\nIn the dataset, for a row that has a NaN for a particular column, the NaN means that the study did not record this particular feature. Having some NaNs is expected considering that the dataset contains the metadata for field studies on thermal comfort and not all study designs are identical. Since scikit's implementation of a random forest cannot tolerate NaN values, columns from the main dataset that contain many NaNs will not be used. Furthermore, rather than trying to infer the value of those features that have a NaN, any entries/rows that contain a NaN will be omitted. Based on this, the columns we'll use are Year, Season, Koppen climate classification, Climate, City, Country, Building type, Cooling straight_building level, Heating strategy_building level, Age, Sex, Thermal preference, Clo, Met, Air temperature (C), Outdoor monthly air temperature (C), Subject's height (cm), Subject's weight (kg). We will extract these columns and delete any rows that have NaN values.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\nfull_df= pd.read_csv('../input/ashrae-global-thermal-comfort-database-ii/ashrae_db2.01.csv', low_memory= False)\n\n#create smaller dataframe with only the person-specific features, non-person-specific features, and what we're trying to predict\npersonal_feats= ['Age', 'Sex', 'Clo','Met',\"Subject«s height (cm)\", \"Subject«s weight (kg)\"]\nother_feats= ['Year', 'Season', 'Koppen climate classification', 'Climate', 'City', 'Country', 'Building type', 'Cooling startegy_building level', 'Heating strategy_building level','Air temperature (C)', 'Outdoor monthly air temperature (C)']\nlabel= ['Thermal preference']\ndf= full_df[personal_feats + other_feats + label]\ndf= df.dropna()\nprint('Dataset size: ', len(df))\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can also see that some of our features (columns) are numerical while others are categorical.

Whether we use only these most important features or all of the features, we get almost the same average recall.** Since we get the same average recall either way, this means that the excluded features do not improve the model's predictive performance very much and don't need to be included. Future thermal comfort studies that will be added to the ASHRAE database can be designed in such a way so that these excluded features are not measured.\n\n# Conclusions\nThe purpose of this notebook was to answer \"How do human and personal factors influence thermal comfort perception?\" using metadata from thermal comfort studies. When considering only person-specific features to predict thermal preference, the most important features to predict thermal preference are Clo, Met, Subject height, and Subject weight. **This suggests that these personal factors are the ones that most strongly influence thermal comfort perception.** However, these person-specific features are not the best to use to predict thermal preference. Instead, the non-person-specific features of Outdoor monthly air temperature, Climate, City, Koppen climate classification, Season, Air temperature, and Year yield the best average recall (~0.59) in a kNN model used to predict thermal preference. A kNN model that used these non-person-specific features performed better than a kNN model that used both person-specific and non-person-specific features, suggesting that environmental factors rather than personal factors most strongly influence thermal comfort perception.\n\n## Suggestions for future work\nAfter data wrangling, the final dataset used for the analyses was very small (1043 examples compared to the original >100,000). Future work should consider using different features and/or using a different technique to deal with NaN values to increase the dataset size. Also along these lines, since the dataset was so small, using cross-validation rather than a train/test split likely would have been a better/more representative approach to the random forest and kNN models. A final suggestion for those wanting to pursue this analysis further is to perform a grid search to determine the best hyperparameter settings for the kNN models rather than using the default settings. By finding the optimal hyperparameter settings, there's a possibility that the average recall for the various kNN models tested here would be higher. Overall I hope this notebook acts as a good spring board for those wanting to further explore \"How do human and personal factors influence thermal comfort perception?\" \n","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
