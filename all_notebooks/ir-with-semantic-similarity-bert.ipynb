By using this technique we extract the most relevant sentences for each task question. Hopefully this tool provides helpful information to medical personnel and other researchers as they seek to quickly get answers to many questions about the deadly COVID-19 virus.  \n\nNote that this notebook was created using an older iteration of the dataset, about 33,000 total articles; thus the stages for reading in the data may need to be adjusted when working with the latest release. This was done due to the time constraint of the challenge as well as the computation requirement for using BERT. As this is the case the notebook has been loaded with the older dataset under the \"cord1933k\" folder. \n\nAlso note that the additional data used is <b><u>only</u></b> for runtime speedup purposes and does not pull any information other than that contained in CORD-19. The data in the \"cord19cleaneddata\" folder is the original data saved in csv files for quick loading to avoid data pre-processing steps. Likewise the \"cord19results\" folder contains the results from running this model over various queries across the corpus using outside GPU hardware resources. \n\nOne final thing to mention is that in various parts of this notebook the dataset has been condensed with slicing. This is only for runtime speedup purposes and thus the answers derived from BERT and word2vec may be affected. <b><u>For the best results change the code where stated to compute over ALL data</u></b>.\n\nTwo useful sources while developing this code base were [COVID-19 Literature Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/maksimeren/covid-19-literature-clustering) and [BERT Semantic Text Similarity](https://github.com/AndriyMulyar/semantic-text-similarity)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Notebook Setup \n\nThis notebook is partitioned into the following sections:\n1.

"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Word2Vec\n\nWord2vec is a combination of models that can be used to learn vectors / embeddings for all words present in a corpus. This algorithm was one of the major break-throughs that started the Deep Learning revolution in the field of NLP as these vector embeddings can be fed into neural networks to better accomplish downstream tasks. Embeddings are typically learned in one of two ways, first a single word is used to predict the context and other words around it (skip-gram); second the context around a word is used to predict the word itself (CBOW). These techniques allow words to be mapped to a vector space (typically 100, 200, or 300 dimensional) where similar words are mapped to similar locations in the space. \n\nFor an in-depth tutorial on this subject see [Word2vec](https://medium.com/@zafaralibagh6/a-simple-word2vec-tutorial-61e64e38a6a1)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### BERT\n\nBERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, was one of the recent major accomplishments in the field of NLP. At the time of its release in 2018 this architecture set the state-of-the-art on the GLUE benchmark encompassing numerous tasks such as question-answering, named-entity-recognition, and natural-language-inference. BERT built upon the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) architecture by adding the concept of both left-to-right and right-to-left (bidirectional) processing. It also leveraged the concept of unsupervised learning by pre-training a massive Language Model (LM) on all of English Wikipedia using a [Masked Language Model](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-masked-language-model-and-how-is-it-related-to-BERT).

This has allowed the architecture to produce incredible scores as it already understands the concept of language extremely well. Thus, instead of having to learn both a language and a task during supervised training, the model only has to learn the task.

In other words the goal of semantic textual similarity is to input two sentences / passages / etc. and output some score value with higher scores corresponding to sentences or passages more similar in meaning and lower scores vice-versa.

Compute Time: BERT is a massive model with millions of parameters; thus it takes 7-8 hours to compute score values for one query across all sentences using a GPU\n2. Hardware Requirements: GPU hardware is critical for fast computation time   \n3. Classification Context Level: Currently sentences are classified by themselves in regard to a score; in the future looking at computing scores across sets of sentences or paragraphs to ensure proper context could be beneficial\n4. Query Wording: Wording can impact results\n\nNote that in terms of the first con (currently the most problematic) there are several obvious solutions that could be implemented going forward to resolve this issue. The first solution would be to use a technique similar to  [Sentence-BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) where sentence embeddings are pre-computed across the corpus. At runtime the only computation requirement is then computing a query embedding along with similarity scores. Thus, instead of sending all the sentences through the model for each query, we only send the query. If this system were to be implemented in the real world this would be a requirement, otherwise the computation time constraints are simply too large.
