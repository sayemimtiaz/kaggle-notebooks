But before applying word2vec model we have first filtered the dataset to get papers that are specifically related to COVID-19, as we know the dataset contains around 50k papers and most of them aren't specifically about Covid-19. Special thanks to [xhlulu](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu) for this useful notebook [cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv) to convert json files to csv, which made it easy for me to spend more time on actual task. For filtering the dataset we have used this notebook [covid-19-thematic-tagging-with-regular-expressions](https://www.kaggle.com/muhammadhassan/covid-19-thematic-tagging-with-regular-expressions) by [Andy White](https://www.kaggle.com/ajrwhite), who have done wonderful work to filter the papers, all thanks to the author.\n\n**PROS:**\n* Makes use of full body text.\n* Quite simple approach.\n\n**CONS:**\n* Doesn't perform well on very short queries.\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n* [Combining csv files corresponding to each folder.](#1)\n* [Getting full body text of filtered papers.](#2)\n* [Training Word2Vec.](#3)\n* [Neonates and pregnant women.](#4)\n* [Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control.](#5)\n* [Transmission dynamics of the virus, including the basic reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, modes of transmission and environmental factors.](#6)\n* [Severity of disease, including risk of fatality among symptomatic hospitalized patients, and high-risk patient groups.](#7)\n* [Co-infections (determine whether co-existing respiratory/viral infections make the virus more transmissible or virulent) and other co-morbidities.](#8)\n* [Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences.](#9)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom nltk import tokenize\nimport json\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\nimport gensim\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Combining csv files corresponding to each folder.<a id= 1></a>\nIndividual csvs' have been generated through this notebook [cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"combined = pd.DataFrame()\nfor file in os.listdir('/kaggle/input/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv/'):\n    if file.endswith('.csv'):\n        df = pd.read_csv(f'/kaggle/input/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv/{file}')\n        combined = pd.concat([combined, df], ignore_index=True)\n        print(f'Total documents in {file}: ', len(df))\n\nprint('='*80)\ncombined['title'] = combined['title'].str.lower() \ncombined['abstract'] = combined['abstract'].str.lower() \nbefore = len(combined)\nprint('Total documents in dataset: ', before)\ncombined.drop_duplicates(subset=['title', 'abstract'], inplace=True)\nprint('After removing duplicates based on title and abstract: ', len(combined))\ncombined.rename(columns={'title': 'combined_title'}, inplace=True)\nprint('Documents with same title and abstract: ', before -

b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of sars-cov-2 infection. therefore, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in european mediterranean and that colombia could have different endpoints from spain and italy.\n* here we replicate figure 1 in figures s4-s5 and show the variation in fatality rates with varying assumptions about the overall infection rate. japan has a relatively old population, south africa a younger population and the us is more evenly distributed. based on the age-specific mortality rates extracted from the italian data, we project how these different countries will experience deaths attributed to covid-19 by age and sex. the united kingdom is as of march 13 2020 is standing out as one of the few european countries to take not stringent actions such as closing schools or stopping large public events. 9 in spite of the comparatively younger population of the uk, the bottom right panel illustrates that the uk could face similar numbers of covid-19 deaths as italy. due to age structure differences, the uk will likely have slightly fewer deaths of those 80+ in comparison to italy, but in the coming weeks still likely to face considerable pressure on its healthcare system.\n* Preventing social contacts and mass gatherings has been used worldwide in the response to reduce transmission communicable diseases, including to reduce transmission of the coronavirus, sars-cov-2. as of march 2020, as of march 2020, multiple countries have banned all gatherings of 1,000 people or more; with some countries such as the czech republic and the usa banning much smaller groups.given knowledge of transmission mechanisms, bringing together large numbers of people into the same space should prove conducive for the spread of close-contact infectious diseases. indeed, mass gatherings have been associated with outbreaks of communicable diseases such as measles [1] , influenza [2] and meningitis [3] . and public health agencies, including the world health organization (who), have specific guidance for preventing disease outbreaks at mass gatherings [4] . factors such as age of participant [1] , zoonotic transmission and presence of animals [5] , crowding [6, 7] , lack of sanitation [7] , location and event duration [6] are associated with the reporting of mass gathering-related outbreaks.despite the evidence of the importance of mass gatherings for disease transmission from intuition and individual outbreaks, the population-level impact of different mass gathering policies has not been established. while systematic reviews have identified outbreak reports involving mass gatherings [5, 6] , the overall impact of mass gatherings could not be quantitatively assessed. a detailed modelling study of disease transmission in the state of georgia, usa, found that in extreme scenarios when 25% of the population participated in a 2day long gathering shortly before the epidemic peak, peak prevalence could increase by up to 10% [8] . more realistic scenarios resulted in minimal population-level changes [8] .here, we use representative data on individuals' daily social contacts, including group contacts, to estimate the population attributable fraction (paf) due to mass gatherings and large numbers of contacts.\n* Novel coronavirus officially covid-19 has been detected since december 2019 and it has become a global health issue concern today. according to the statistics from the vietnam’s ministry of health, until 13february 2020, vietnam has fifteen positive cases with covid-19, which one of those is a 3-month-old baby (ministry of health, 2020). it is estimated that the covid-19 outbreak will be reached the top in the next ten days due to the excessive worrying and wrong behaviors towards the virus (thu, 2020). in this letter, the author presents three noticeable issues based on the current situation in vietnam and efforts that nurses should do.\n* The rapid spread of covid-19 has revealed the need to understand how population dynamics interact with pandemics now and in the future. population ageing is currently more pronounced in wealthier countries, which mercifully may lessen the impact of this pandemic on poorer countries with weaker health systems but younger age structures. it is plausible that poor general health status and coinfections such as tuberculosis may still increase the danger of covid-19 among younger cases in these countries. thus far, the lower than expected number of cases detected in africa (despite extensive trade and travel links with china), suggests that the young age structure of the continent may be protective of severe and thus detectable cases, or it may be undetected. beyond age structure, there are large sex differences in mortality that need to be understood -with men at higher risk -some of which may be accounted for by the stark differences in smoking rates by sex in asia. distributions of underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and copd will likewise refine risk estimates. until these more nuanced data are available, the concentration of mortality risk in the oldest old ages remains one of the best tools we have to predict the burden of critical cases and thus more precise planning of availability of hospital beds, staff and other resources.at this moment, few countries are routinely releasing their covid-19 data with key demographic information such age, sex, or comorbidities."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nquery = 'What are the economic impacts of covid-19 pandemic, what are different socio-economic and behavioral factors arised as a result of covid-19 that can affect economy?
