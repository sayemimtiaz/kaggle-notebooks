They also provide access to the Changi Ariport. LRT stations are concentrated in 2 different areas where MRT lines are less prevelant. It can be assumed that those 2 areas are too highly poplulated for sparce MRT in the region, therefore LRT serves as a feeder line for the MRT"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
