Experts are trying there best for solving this global crisis. Every single day thousands of research articles are published. Keeping up with these huge pools of articles is impossible. Often great articles failed to draw attention. For this reason, Kaggle as a global data science and machine learning community hosts this challenge to solve this problem. In round 2, we have to summarize articles in a tabular format. So that researcher and expert can easily get a bird's eye view of articles and more importantly filter these huge pools of articles. ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Solution\nResearch papers have thousands of variation. There are no single patters that can be used to summarize them into a tabular format. Regex is useful but because of this large diversity, the regex usefulness is very limited. Often time it will break and if we build any regex engine it will be not very efficient. For this, we have to move to more forward technology. We will use NLP ( Natural Language Processing ) for those labels that are not possible to handle with regex. There are also some static columns like Date, Study title, Journal, their data is already available in metadata dataset. We will use some pre-hand coded keywords for extracting study design. \n\nOne of the important division of NLP is Named Entity Recognition ( NER ). It is very widely used in the NLP industry. \n> Named Entity Recognition, also known as entity extraction classifies named entities that are present in a text into pre-defined categories like “individuals”, “companies”, “places”, “organization”, “cities”, “dates”, “product terminologies” etc. It adds a wealth of semantic knowledge to your content and helps you to promptly understand the subject of any given text.\n\n![](http://imanage.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NER1.png)\n\nThat's exactly what we need. We need to extract data from raw text (articles) to pre-defined categories like Address ```Population```, ```Challenge```, ```Solutions```. So for this project, I have build custom NER models for each task that successfully extract the necessary information for given labels and store it to a table. This is a de-facto solution for this type of problem. Because if you use regex then for new articles it may not match. But NER is a machine learning model. It can identify context and can perform very good on any new research articles.

First, we will import all the provided hand-labelled target table datasets and combined them into one dataframe. Then we will get information on static columns from metadata dataset. After that, we will use a portion of that dataframe to build a custom annotation dataset. And then we will train our NER model using spacy NLP library.
