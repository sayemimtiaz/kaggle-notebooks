Using R, you can take raw data and understand the trends and patterns in it. You can also use R to create customizable, professional-looking visualizations.\n\nThis tutorial will help introduce you to the R programming language. I'm not going to assume any programming background for this tutorial. \n\n**To get started, click the blue \"fork notebook\" button in the upper right hand corner.**\n\n![The button to fork this notebook](https://image.ibb.co/kNKUZ5/Screenshot_from_2017_08_30_16_47_40.png)\n\n> \"**Forking**\" something is making a copy of it that you can edit on your own without changing the original. \n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n### Learning goals:\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to do the following things. (Don't worry if you don't know what all these things are yet; we'll get there together!)\n\n* [Be familiar with basic concepts: functions, variables, data types and vectors](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/getting-started-in-r-first-steps/)\n* [Load data into R](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/getting-started-in-r-load-data-into-r)\n* [Summerize your data](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/getting-started-in-r-summarize-data)\n* [Graph data and save your graphs](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/getting-started-in-r-graphing-data/)\n\n______\n\n### Your turn!\n\nThroughout this tutorial, you'll have lots of opportunities to practice what you've just learned.

Now let's break it down a little bit. \n______\nThere were two parts to the line of code you just ran:\n\n### print()\n   * This is what's called a \"**function**\". A function is like a verb; it tells the computer to do something. What that \"something\" is depends on the function. This function, print(), tell R to print out whatever was passed to it.\n   * For now, we're going to use functions that are already in R. Later on, however, we'll write our own!\n\n### \"I'm coding in R!\"\n   * This second part, inside the parentheses, is what is called an \"**argument**\". It's information that that function needs in order to run. In this case, we're giving the print() function a text string to print.\n   * One thing to watch out for is that certain functions require certain types of data as their arguments. Trying to give a function a type of data it can't handle is a common cause of bugs (a \"bug\" is a problem in your code).\n   \n   \n> You can think of a functions like verbs, and arugments nouns. Just like verbs, not all functions need arguments (\"I smiled\"), and some functions need more than one (\"I put the flowers in the vase\").\n\n______\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"845147afdfb5bd4253286d4fd1e0a72212e9290d","_kg_hide-output":true,"_cell_guid":"54038d26-85a3-4437-abff-775811eb352c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your turn!
