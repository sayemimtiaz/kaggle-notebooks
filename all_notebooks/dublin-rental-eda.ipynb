A large number of immigrants have caused rents to rise in Ireland, especially in the Dublin area. \n\nA lot of large companies are established in Dublin (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Huawei, TikTok etc), so Dublin may be the best place to live in Ireland, no matter work or study. Dublin has Trinity College (TCD), University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin City University (DCU) and Dublin University of Technology (TU Dublin) and other universities that attract a large number of students to study. In this context, it becomes very difficult for someone who has been to Dublin in the future to find a suitable house. As an international student studying in Ireland, my requirement for a house is to keep the rent as low as possible under safe conditions. Therefore, in this notebook, I will mainly use the rental data collected on Daft.ie to explore where to rent a house, and appropriately introduce my rental experience in Dublin.\n\n**If you just like me two years ago, are someone who knows little about Dublin and is desperate to find a suitable house in Dublin real property market, I hope this Notebook can help you.**\n\n**The map and final conclusion in the bottom, you can scroll down to bottom.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import the necessary library\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport re\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# folium, json and requests will be used for creating maps\nimport folium \nimport json\nimport requests\n\nplt.style.use(\"ggplot\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

But what is interesting is that I found that the rents in Sallynoggin and Johnstown next to Dalkey are relatively low (755 euro-971 euro). If you go to school at UCD, I think Sallynoggin and Johnstown may be very good choices. In addition, Milltown has lower rents than surrounding areas. At the same time, Milltown is closer to the city center. If your company or school is in the city center, Milltown may be a good choice.\n\n**My experience:**\n\nAs I mentioned before, I used to live in Grangegorman, Warrenmount and Ranelagh.
