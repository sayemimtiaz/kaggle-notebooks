Only 12% percent of the time it appears that biased words are used.  The most common biased word was \"competitive\" which occurs 1293 times.  \n\n### Gender bias research\n\nGender-bias means using words to target male or female job applicants.  Gaucher, Friesen, and Kay researched gender bias in job advertisements and made a list of gender-coded words.  They published this list in \"Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality\" in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, July 2011, Vol 101(1), p109-28.  The gender-bias app finds these gender-coded words.  I customized this app to read the Los Angeles Job Bulletins and check for gender-bias.  gender-bias has three bias detectors.  I added two more.  \n\n### Easier to read \n\n\"Non-native speakers\" bias detector check for complex words that might discourage people who speak English as a second language.  I based this bias detector on my experience staffing project teams in 27 different countries where I was not a native speaker.  To find complex words, I modified a text analyzer from Allen Downey's book, Think Python, 2nd Edition. It read the Job Bulletins and reported a list of the most commonly used words.  It also evaluated the 50 most complex words over 10 characters long.  This script is explained in the [WordCounts](https://www.kaggle.com/nelsondata/wordcounts/edit/run/15428692) kernel.  WordCounts is a plug-in modules.  \n\n### Plugging-in other tools and techniques\n\nKnowing the Kaggle community, I realize the City of Los Angeles will receive many valuable submissions.  My prototype is modular so you can plug-in these tools or mix and match to meet your needs.\n\n### Technology\n\nNOTICE:  Please do not confuse any files in this kernel with the Job Bulletin CSV file requested for this competition.  The Job Bulletin CSV file is in the [Text2CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/nelsondata/text2csv) kernel.\n\n```\nUbuntu 18.04 LTS\nPython\nPandas\nMatplotlib\nGraphViz\nBigHugeThesaurus API\nWordCloud\nregex\nNLTK\nGender-bias app\n```"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Good results \n\nThe Job Bulletins contain 1,060,919 words. However, only 8,200 different words are used. This indicates that these Job Bulletins consistently use a select group of words. The most used words are grammar words, such as \"the\" (used 52,261 times). Grammar words are also called \"stopwords\".  Looking past stopwords, the Job Bulletins focus on candidates because \"candidates\" was used 6,647  times and \"applicants\" was used 5,150 times. Many jobs require an \"examination\" (used 5,691 times) and experience (used 4,115 times) plus qualifications (used 3,810  times).  \n\nOf the original 186 possible biased words, 108 words were verified as likely to be biased.  Biased words were verified by looking up the phrase where the word was used.  If the word was not found, then a false positive was reported.  Initially it appeared that biased words were used 65,134 times.  After verifying, it is more likely that biased words are used 8,001 times.  Zero false positives were found.\n\nOnly 2% of the words appear biased meaning 98% are bias free.  12% percent of the time it appears that biased words are used.\n\nThe most common biased word was \"competitive\" which occurs 1293 times.  Words such as \"competitive\" or \"compete\" attract male applicants more frequently. \n\n1434 complex words were found meaning these words had more than 10 characters.  Using shorter words can make Job Bulletins easier to read.  For example, \"examination\" was used 5,691 times.  Consider using \"exam\" or \"test\".\n\n### Pointing out where Job Bulletins are missing data\n\nOne Job Bulletin has embedded characters that prevent it from opening properly:  POLICE COMMANDER 2251 092917.txt\n\nThese Job Bulletins do not have job class numbers in the file name:\n```\nELECTRIC SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE\nREFUSE COLLECTION TRUCK OPERATOR\nELEVATOR REPAIR SUPERVISOR\nREHABILITATION CONSTRUCTION SPECIALIST\nELECTRICAL SERVICES MANAGER\n```\nThis Job Bulletin was removed because it has no Job Class in the Job Bulletin or the file name:\n```Vocational Worker  DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS.txt```\n\n### Recommending improvements for Human Resources\n\nConsider replacing the word 'competitive'.  For example, \"open competitive basis\", might be called \"new-hire basis\" or \"open hiring basis\".  Or the City of Los Angeles can make a decision to add this word to the non-bias list."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import

details\n\nGender-bias is an app that uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to find gender-biased words.  I customized it to read and evaluate the City of Los Angeles Job Bulletins.  Words were checked against a not-biased list.  This list was based on my estimates.  It can and should be customized by Human Resources.  Six hiring bias detectors were used but more can be added:\n\n- native_speakers - detects words that could be simpler, for example, \"exam\" rather than \"examination\"\n\n- gender_terms - detects unnecessary use of gendered pronouns such as \"she\" or \"he\"\n\t\n- effort_accomplishment - detects subtle focus towards men or women.  Studies show that women are more associated with \"effort\" and men with \"accomplishment\" \n\t\n- personal_life - detects subtle bias towards women because women are more likely to speak about personal life\n\t\n- male_terms - detects words that attract men, such as, \"competitive\"\n\t\n- female_terms - detects words that attract women, such as, \"interpersonal\"\n\n### gender-bias app finds the location of biased words\n\nGender-bias outputs text files.
