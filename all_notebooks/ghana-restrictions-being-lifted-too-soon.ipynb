What we do not know is how to bring people back to life \nBy Nana Kofi Quakyi Jul 26,2020\n\n\nIn its early days, Ghana’s COVID-19 response was heralded as a success story. It was a viral sensation.\n\nBut the ovation is fading and the West African nation’s case count is surging.\n\nGhana isn’t the only African country that initially appeared to have COVID-19 under control. Others, like South Africa, were also praised for taking early, decisive action. But the recent surge in coronavirus cases in Ghana, and the inability of the country’s health system to cope with it, were seeded by the outlook, oversights and omissions in the easing of its lockdown.\n\nThe partial lockdown of Accra and Kumasi, Ghana’s principal cities, bought the government time to prepare for the onslaught of the virus. The nation needed to be ready for testing and contact tracing, providing personal protective equipment for health workers and dealing with patients in need of acute care for COVID-19. And it had to make provisions to sustain all these as the epidemic evolved.\n\nBut the extra time would only be afforded if the lockdown actually slowed the spread of the virus. So in deciding when to ease the restrictions, knowing the degree of this impact was of the essence, as was progress on those public health and health system reinforcements. Ghana’s timing was bad. https://theconversation.com/ghanas-much-praised-covid-19-strategy-has-gone-awry-here-is-why-143217","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns #visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualization\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Unfinished business\n\nThe government announced an end to the lockdown on 19 April. Yet data published by the Ghana Health Service did not offer conclusive evidence that the objectives of the restrictions had been met.\n\nIt was unclear whether the spread of COVID-19 had actually slowed – and by how much.\n\nSome references were made to the health system and public health improvements in announcing the end of the lockdown. But details were opaque. Within 10 days of President Akufo-Addo’s national address, the Ghana Medical Association was attributing rising health worker infections to poor distribution of protective supplies.\n\nExisting facilities for intensive care were still being expanded when the restrictions on movement were lifted, and authorities were still scouting locations for new isolation centres.\n\nGhana’s limited testing capacity also needed to be expanded, as the entire public health response depended on early case detection. Plans for new and expanded laboratories were still being drawn up when the lockdown was ended.\n\nThe authorities touted pooled testing as an answer. Multiple samples were grouped together and tested. The samples in each pool were individually retested only if a pool returned a positive result for COVID-19. If the pool was negative then it was assumed that all the samples in it were negative.\n\nPool testing is useful where there is low viral prevalence, and much less so in a large outbreak. If capacity for individual testing wasn’t significantly increased before pooled testing reached its limits, Ghana’s ability to detect and manage cases would be severely compromised. https://theconversation.com/ghanas-much-praised-covid-19-strategy-has-gone-awry-here-is-why-143217","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#People wait to receive food and water in Accra, Ghana, during a partial lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID19), april 04, 2020. \n![](https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced_410px_wide/s3/2020-04/reuters_ghana_food_distribution_03Apr20.JPG?itok=r79sxPby)https://www.voanews.com/africa/ghanas-decision-lift-partial-covid-19-lockdown-criticized-some#:~:text=People%20wait%20to%20receive%20food%20and%20water%20in%20Accra,%20Ghana,","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ls ../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/GH/","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/BCG_country_data.csv', encoding='utf8')\ndf1.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Alternative hypothesis\n\nEarly in the epidemic, authorities adopted a testing target as the benchmark for ending the restrictions on movement. The objective was to locate some 34,000 travellers who arrived in Ghana between early March and the closure of the border on 22 March; to identify and trace people they had come into contact with; and to test these travellers and their associates for COVID-19.\n\nThe “enhanced contact tracing” exercise, as the president explained on 5 April, would inform future action. By 19 April, 1.27% of some 51,721 people – just over half of those targeted – were found to be positive for COVID-19.\n\nThis result was used as the primary evidence that Ghana’s disease burden was small, and that the epidemic had been substantively contained.\n\nBut that testing wasn’t representative. It ignored community spread, which had been documented as early as 20 March. It seemingly underestimated the risk of a large outbreak from undetected cases; how quickly that might happen; and the impact on the still limited laboratories, the still inadequate public health infrastructure, and the still underprepared healthcare system.\n\nThe reduction of the volunteer contact tracer workforce after the lockdown exemplified the authorities’ rhetoric that the worst of COVID-19 was over.\n\nEighteen weeks into the outbreak, Ghana’s COVID-19 response is buckling under the weight of reality.https://theconversation.com/ghanas-much-praised-covid-19-strategy-has-gone-awry-here-is-why-143217","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"repGhana = df1[(df1['country_name']=='Ghana')].reset_index(drop=True)\nrepGhana.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 22.6% positivity rate for 6 July suggested that Ghana’s testing regime is not casting a wide enough net to give a true picture of community spread. That statistic was as high as 30.1% on 3 July, and the average for the week ending on 6 July was 23.8%.\n\nThe medical community’s fears have also materialised. The rate of infections among healthcare workers is staggering. A total of 779 had been infected in the line of duty as of 1 July, and that number has been revised to upwards of 2,000 over the course of the month. Insufficient and inadequate PPE, slow testing, and limited institutional capacity are driving this disturbing trend.\n\nThe present state of Ghana’s epidemic is at least partly attributable to the premature lifting of the shelter-in-place order. But its future hinges on whether the nation’s strategy will remain unresponsive to the evolving realities of community spread, the limitations and urgent needs of its fragile public health system, and the daunting risks health workers continue to face. So far the evidence is not promising.\n\nAuthorities in Ghana continue to ease restrictions. Schools have been reopened for final year students, despite public concern. Scores of students and staff have been infected. The health minister rejected calls to reconsider this decision on the grounds that it would be cowardly to reverse course. He only recently recovered from the virus himself.\n\nA mass voter registration exercise is also under way nationwide, despite an open appeal against it by over 200 physicians who cited the obvious risk of further spread of COVID-19.https://theconversation.com/ghanas-much-praised-covid-19-strategy-has-gone-awry-here-is-why-143217","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.bar(repGhana, \n             x='lockdown_start', y='lockdown_end', color_discrete_sequence=['#2B3A67'],\n             title='Ghana Covid-19 Lockdown', text='population')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Ghana = '../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/GH/Ghana-en-result-113-original.txt'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"text = open(Ghana, 'r',encoding='utf-8',\n                 errors='ignore').read()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(text[:2000])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/task_2-owid_covid_data-21_June_2020.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ghana = df[(df['location']=='Ghana')].reset_index(drop=True)\nghana.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes from Taikutsu   https://www.kaggle.com/ravels1991/tjsp-e-seus-sal-rios-astron-micos","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,6))\nghana['new_cases_per_million'].value_counts(normalize=True, ascending=True).plot(kind='barh', cmap='bone', ax=axes,\n                                                                  title='Ghana Total Cases per Million');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,6))\nghana['total_cases_per_million'].value_counts(normalize=True, ascending=True).plot(kind='barh', cmap='bone', ax=axes,\n                                                                  title='Ghana New Cases per Million');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The original code has a $ (dollar sign/cifrão)before {}","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_date(col, df, title):\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(18,6))\n    df.groupby(['date'])[col].sum().plot(rot=45, kind='bar', ax=ax, legend=True, cmap='bone')\n    ax.set_yticklabels(['{:,}'.format(int(x)) for x in ax.get_yticks().tolist()])\n    ax.set(Title=title, xlabel='Date')\n    return ax","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_date('total_cases', df, 'Ghana Covid19 Total Cases');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_date('total_deaths', df, 'Ghana Deaths by Covid19 ');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_date('new_cases', df, 'Ghana Covid19 New Cases');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#word cloud\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, ImageColorGenerator\ntext = \" \".join(str(each) for each in repGhana.official_state_name)\n# Create and generate a word cloud image:\nwordcloud = WordCloud(max_words=200,colormap='Set2', background_color=\"black\").generate(text)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\n# Display the generated image:\nplt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='Bilinear')\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.figure(1,figsize=(12, 12))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata   @mpwolke  ","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
