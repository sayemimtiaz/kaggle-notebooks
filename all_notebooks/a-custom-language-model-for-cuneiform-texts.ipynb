Generally speaking, a [language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Within this broad definition, we find different types of models. Some of the most common use the concept of _n-gram_, i.e. sequences of n consecutive characters in which we split the text. N-gram models are common in NLP literature. Their applications include speech recognition, machine translation, or handwriting recognition. Not surprisingly, there are some well-known packages in Python, such as [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/), that make constructing an N-gram model becomes a relatively easy task. Here, I use an N-gram model to predict the probability that a sequence of cuneiform n-grams belongs to a particular Ancient Mesopotamian language or dialect.\n\nNow, as you may have already guessed, I wouldn't be writing this post if I had followed that easy path for this challenge. On the contrary, this notebook is about how to construct an N-gram model from scratch. In fact, the only libraries I use are `numpy` and `pandas`. There are two reasons why I decided to do it this way: first of all, standard NLP libraries are designed to work with Latin characters, so adapting them to cuneiform text is a bit of a pain. Second, it's fun! I am a firm believer that the best way of testing your knowledge on a subject is to go to the basics and see if you can code it with as few specialised libraries as possible. That is what I do in this notebook.\n\nThe N-gram model implementation that I have come up with is inspired in the type of N-gram models that use Markov chains and the Markov assumption. Simply put, this assumption states that the probability of an n-gram in position $t$ depends only on the previous $k$ n-grams (where $k$ is usually 1). Hence, the probability of a sequence can be computed by taking the product of conditional probabilities of its n-grams. \n\nMy code does not _exactly_ do that, but something simpler. What the code actually does is to compute the probability of bigrams ($n$ = 2) for a training set of each of the languages, and estimates the probability that an observed sequence belong to each of the languages. The language with the highest probability is assigned as a prediction. \n\nObviously, more complex methods can be developed. However, I have found that this very simple model already performs really well on a test set, with a weighted F-1 score of ~0.8 (depending on how train-test split). \n\nHope you find it interesting!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Libraries and data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-08T10:19:54.374243Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-08T10:19:54.374735Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-08T10:19:54.380833Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-08T10:19:54.374692Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-08T10:19:54.379209Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read data in\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cuneiform-language-identification/train.csv')\nprint('Shape:', df.shape)\ndf.sample(10).head(10)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-08T10:14:49.613732Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-08T10:14:49.614141Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-08T10:14:49.898364Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-08T10:14:49.614107Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-08T10:14:49.896973Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Implementation\nThe cells below show the helper functions and class that make up the implementation of the simple model explained in the introduction.
