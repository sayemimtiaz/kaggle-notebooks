One of their strengths lies in the fact that they explicitly model relations (i.e. edges) between individual units (i.e. nodes), which adds an extra dimension to the data.\n\nWe can illustrate the added value of this data enrichment using the [Cora citation network](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA). This dataset contains a bag-of-words representation for a few hundred papers and the citation relations between each of these papers. If we apply dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) to create a 2D plot of the bag-of-words representations (Figure, left), we can see clusters (they are colored according to their research topic) arise but they overlap. If we produce an embedding with a graph network (Figure, right), that takes into account the citation information, we can see the clusters being better separated.\n    \n![left: A t-SNE embedding of the bag-of-words representations of each paper. right: An embedding produced by a graph network that takes into account the citations between papers. source: [“Deep Graph Infomax” by Velickovic et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10341)](https://miro.medium.com/max/493/0*y332aTSAuQIkzz_K.png)\n    \n<p style=\"text-align: center\">--> source: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10341\">Deep Graph Infomax” by Velickovic et al.</a> </p>\n\n**Knowledge Graphs (KG)** are a specific type of graph. They are multi-relational (i.e. there are different edges for different types of relations) and directed (i.e. the relations have a subject and object). These properties allow to represent information from heterogeneous sources in a uniform format.","attachments":{}},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Countries in DBpedia\n\nThis dataset describes information of several countries from DBpedia. Let’s take a look at how the KG looks in the neighbourhood of a specific country: 🇧🇪 Belgium 🇧🇪. This process is analogous to going to [its corresponding DBpedia page](http://dbpedia.org/page/Belgium) and then recursively clicking on all the links on that page. We depict this below in Figure 3. We notice that expanding this neighbourhood iteratively makes things complex quickly, even though we introduced some simplifications by removing some of the parts. Nevertheless, we see that DBpedia contains some useful information about Belgium (e.g., its national anthem, largest city, currency, …).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1890/1*-fo07n-06Obzqks4hoGQyg.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Creating Entity Embeddings With RDF2Vec\n\n**[RDF2vec](rdf2vec.org)** stands for Resource Description Framework To Vector. It is an unsupervised, task-agnostic algorithm to numerically represent nodes in a KG, allowing them to be used for further (downstream) machine learning tasks. RDF2Vec builds on top of existing natural language processing techniques: it combines insights from DeepWalk and Word2Vec. Word2Vec is able to generate embeddings for each word in a provided collection of sentences (often called a corpus). To generate a corpus for a KG, we extract walks. Extracting walks is similar to visiting a DBpedia page of an entity and clicking on links. The number of clicks you make is equivalent to the number of hops in a walk. An example of such a walk, again for Belgium, would be: \n\nBelgium -> dbo:capital -> City of Brussels -> dbo:mayor -> Yvan Mayeur. \n\nNote that we make no distinction between predicates/properties (e.g., dbo:capital and dbo:mayor) and entities (e.g., Belgium, Brussels, Yvan Mayeur, …) in our walks, as explained in Figure 2. Each walk can now be seen as a sentence, and the hops in that walk correspond to the tokens (words) of a sentence. Once we extracted a large number of walks rooted at the entities we want to create embeddings for, we can provide that as a corpus to Word2Vec. Word2Vec will then learn embeddings for each unique hop which can then be used for ML tasks.\n\npyRDF2Vec is a repository that contains a Python implementation of the RDF2Vec algorithm. On top of the original algorithm, different extensions are implemented as well.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*dgij9Wdt9LgEo-CCltet8g.png)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Something is weird going on with the latest version of pip\n# we need to do this import or else import gensim (which is done \n# within pyrdf2vec) crashes after the pip install\nimport gensim","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n!pip install pyrdf2vec --use-feature=2020-resolver","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Tutorial: creating country representations with pyRDF2Vec\n\nIn this tutorial, I will demonstrate basic usage of the pyRDF2Vec library using the country dataset previously described.
