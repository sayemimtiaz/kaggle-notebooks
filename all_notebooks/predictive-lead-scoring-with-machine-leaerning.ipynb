So, I'm tempted to drop the column entirely. If the data were numerical, I could fill all null values with the mode or median.\n* There are also missing values in the educational column, but few enough that we lose less data by removing every entry (row) that has a null value, rather than remove the column entirely\n* The education column is using both numbers and phrases to describe the category, which is redundant. I would like to rename these.\n* The age column is doing the same thing, and also doesn't provide tidy categories. Does under 45 also mean over 25, because the next youngest category cutoff is 25? I need to rename these.\n* I don't know what the customer psychology or family income categories map to which characteristics. I posed this question on the discussion forum, but will remove the column for now. \n* There are some 'U's in the child category, which I take to mean unknown. Since this comprises almost one-fourth of the data entries, I'm going to delete the entire column.\n\nI'm tempted to just remove anything I don't understand, but first I'll look at a correlation heatmap to see if I can't afford to lose any one category.
