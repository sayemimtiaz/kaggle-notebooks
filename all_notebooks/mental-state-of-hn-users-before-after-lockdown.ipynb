What could I've done better or different? Where could I employ further or advanced techniques/ML/etc?\n\n***tldr; results are at the bottom and main paramaters which you can change are in the next code block!***\n\n***Edit1: FWIW, We have a 19% increase of more HN submissions in the same period but they do not translate in more traffic. If you look at HN's traffic on similarweb.com: HN hadn't skyrocketed like all other media outlets bc of COVID. My interpretation is that HN users are to HN addicted despite lockdown or not, it doesn't make a difference. Moreover, I dropped also submission which didn't hit the front page (coments<10). So the increase it not related to any traffic increase.***\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lockdown start, no year b/c we need the date to get the period of the prior year\nLOCKDOWN_START_DATE = '03-31'\n\n# Posts to be dropped under this comment threshold\nCOMMENT_THRESHOLD = 10\n\n# Only posts that match this regex to be included \nREG = 'depression|suicide|anxiety|burn?out|ptsd|ketamine|loneliness|isolation|sleep?deprivation'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nhn = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/all-hacker-news-posts-stories-askshow-hn-polls/hn.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"Latest entry in the HN dataset is from {hn['Created At'].max()}\")\n\nhn_temp = hn[((hn['Created At'] > f\"2019-{LOCKDOWN_START_DATE}\") & (hn['Created At'] < '2019-09-17')) | (hn['Created At'] > f\"2020-{LOCKDOWN_START_DATE}\")]\n\nhn2 = hn_temp.assign(in_lockdown=hn['Created At'] > '2020-03-31').dropna(subset=['Title'])\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## All Posts\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"hn2.groupby('in_lockdown').describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Regexed Posts + Low-comment Posts removed"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"hn3 = hn2[hn2.Title.str.contains(REG) ]\n\nhn5 = hn3[hn3['Number of Comments'] > COMMENT_THRESHOLD]\n\nhn5.groupby('in_lockdown').describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Results"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"expl = 'with depression related keywords in the title after lockdown vs before'\n\npost_diff = (hn5[hn5['in_lockdown'] == True].Title.count() / hn5[hn5['in_lockdown'] == False].Title.count() - 1) * 100\nprint(f\"{round(post_diff)}% more submissions {expl}\\n\")\n\ncomment_diff = (hn5[hn5['in_lockdown'] == True]['Number of Comments'].mean() / hn5[hn5['in_lockdown'] == False]['Number of Comments'].mean() -1) * 100\nprint(f\"{round(comment_diff)}% more comments on posts {expl}\\n\")\n\npoint_diff = (hn5[hn5['in_lockdown'] == True]['Points'].mean() / hn5[hn5['in_lockdown'] == False]['Points'].mean() -1) * 100\nprint(f\"{round(point_diff)}% more upvotes on posts {expl}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
