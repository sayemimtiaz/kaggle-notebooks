Thus, early detection and treatment of diabetes can prevent complications and assist in reducing the risk of severe health problems. \nEven though it's incurable, it can be managed by treatment and medication.\n\n**Motivation :- As a person who suffered from gestational diabetes I want to get better understanding of this disease among women and use machine learning models to identify patients who are at risk of diabetes.**\n\n**This week I started learning about Ensemble techniques so trying to use them**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Objective:\n\nTo build a model to predict whether an individual is at risk of diabetes or not.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# DataSet Description:\n\n* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant\n* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test\n* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)\n* SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)\n* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)\n* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)\n* Pedigree: Diabetes pedigree function - A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.\n* Age: Age in years\n* Class: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Questions\n1.

Other variables' importance is not significant. \n* Identifying the risk of diabetes at early stages, especially among pregnant women, can help to control the disease and prevent the second health problems.\n* As per the decision tree We can have Profile for women\n    - `Lower Risk Women` :Glucose level <=127 ,Age <=28.\n    - `Higher Risk Women`:Glucose level >100 ,Age >28 /BMI> 28.5\n    \n    But as per the patterns we see in misclassfied data.Our model is unable to find those case when Age or BMI plays major role than Glucose concentration.\n    So Glucose ,Age and BMI should be  given equal importance in identifying high risk patients.\n * Need to further explore if any other algorthims or more hypertuning parameters help in improving the accuracy of the model along with recall.\n \n ## Recommendation\n  Depending on the patients profile following recommendation to patients can prevent them from getting diabetes.\n* Middle aged to older women have a higher risk of diabetes. They should keep the glucose level in check and take proper precautions.\n* Overweight women have a higher risk of diabetes. They should keep the glucose level in check and exercise regularly. \n","metadata":{}}]}
