There have been 299 deaths, entire villages were destroyed and thousands were left homeless. From that day, tens of thousands of minor earthquakes hit the area with a frequency of about 5 minutes.\nThe surrounding area has a notorious fame for geological instability, as Italy lies near the fault line that exists between Eurasian and African tectonic plates. Earthquakes happen when one of these plates scrapes, bumps or drags along another plate.\nIn this notebook we will carry out some basic analysis and visualizations of this dataset. \n\nA little disclaimer before we begin. I know nearly nothing about earthquakes and geology. I'm just having fun doing some very basic data analysis and visualization, so the things I might say and the thoughts I might have about earthquakes should be taken with a (big) grain of salt.\n\nYou can find the full post about this notebook [here][1].\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.thedataware.com/post/italys-recent-earthquakes-a-look-at-the-data"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5e24c43b-3e12-5eb7-f676-0c4897915006","_uuid":"7c5d56b0ae91b50a9c1a9b4189978cd355e5ee82","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting\n\nplt.style.use(\"ggplot\")\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e9e28553-07e5-caac-bcc3-1a611cc2d5af","_uuid":"fb76a79eb874a002d6a2f87f2f5322e013913ab7","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/italy_earthquakes_from_2016-08-24_to_2016-11-30.csv').set_index('Time')\ndf.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b6f75bda-f697-5d63-534c-4835748f84ac","_uuid":"1fc42cc51d84ee6220c5c475c1dc920352c63489","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Compute summary statistics\ndf.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"221a676f-ac85-51a4-d0e6-b110ee3c2404","_uuid":"7641394772d2911b9c14a699dd67529784c08e96"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Magnitude\nThe simplest numeric measure of an earthquake strenght is the magnitude.\nThe magnitude of an earthquake is usually measured by the [Richter Scale][1].
