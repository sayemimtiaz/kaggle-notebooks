Another less known in Europe brand is **Buick** - it's an american brand manufacturing luxury cars, however it's main market is China.\n\nSome more details:\n\n1. [Ford Motor Company](https://www.ford.com/) is an American automotive concern founded on 16 June 1903 by Henry Ford in Detroit. Currently, it is a large automotive industry concern producing cars, trucks, buses, agricultural vehicles and machines, IT equipment and other products. This concern has approximately 199 000 employees (2019). In the USA, luxury Ford models are manufactured and  sold under the **Lincoln** brand. Ford also purchased small shares in the **Mazda** and **Aston Martin** brands. In 1989 the concern became the owner of the Jaguar brand, and since 2000 Land Rover but both were sold to Toyota Motors in 2008. Since 1999, Ford has owned Volvo, which was sold in 2010 to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. In 2011, Ford stopped producing cars under the Mercury name (a price positioned brand between Ford and Lincoln), which had been in operation since 1938. Ford is the second largest car manufacturer in the US and the fifth largest in the world. In 2015, around 6 635 000 cars left Ford's factories. The largest non-american plant is Ford-Werke AG in Cologne, Germany.  \n\n2. [Chevrolet](https://www.chevrolet.com/) is an American automotive brand belonging to the **General Motors group**, whose cars are available in over 140 countries around the world. Is the fourth most-bought car brand in the world. Chevrolet was founded in 1911 by Louis Chevrolet and mechanic, and William C. \"Billy\" Durant. The company's headquarters are in Detroit (like Ford's).\n\n3. [Toyota Motor Corporation](https://www.toyota.com/) (TMC) is a Japanese automotive group founded in 1937 by Sakichi Toyoda. During World War II, a small city car was designed at Toyota factories in hope to motorize Japan. In 1947, work on the SA model was completed. In 1951, a BJ prototype was built, inspired by the design of Jeep Willys, giving rise to the Land Cruiser series, and in 1955 the Crown model was launched. In 1966, the most popular model in the world - **Corolla** - went into production. In 1997, the first mass-produced Toyota's hybrid car, the Prius model, was put into production. In 1982, Toyota Motor Company and Toyota Motor Sales merged into one company called Toyota Motor Corporation. In 1984, a company was formed with the American automotive group General Motors - The United Motor Manufacturing Inc. The purpose of building the company was to conquer the American market, where the Camry model appeared in 1983. In 1989, a sub-brand was created to manufacture luxury cars called **Lexus**. \n\nCar brands owned by Toyota Motor Corporation:  \n•\tToyota - a Japanese brand founded in 1937   \n•\tDaihatsu - a Japanese brand founded in 1907, belonging to TMC since 1967  \n•\tLexus - a Japanese brand founded in 1989 by TMC   \n•\tHino Motors - a Japanese truck manufacturer \n•\tScion - a Japanese brand existing in the years 2002 - 2015 founded by TMC  \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5.
