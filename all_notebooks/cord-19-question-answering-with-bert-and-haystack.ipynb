We favored generalizability over specificity because we felt that developing one specific fit-for-purpose solution for each question may give accurate results, but it cannot scale to the real world scenario, where researchers will have many new questions as they learn more about the virus and the disease. We also chose to use open source packages implementing advanced deep learning NLP algorithms that can be used flexibly within a simple notebook but can scale to large scale operations, since they will enable this solution to be used more effectively in institutions that have the computing power to extract its full potential.\n\nWe define the problem as follows. We have a set of documents which we consider a 'context' space from which we would like to extract answers. This can be split in three steps, for any given question:\n\n- Retrieving relevant documents / sections from the full text papers\n- Locating potential answers from these relevant documents\n- Presenting the results to a researcher with enough information\n\nWe felt that by having a solution that addresses these three needs, we could dramatically speed up the process that researchers have to follow when looking for answers to their questions. More importantly, we felt this could be generalized to many other questions researchers may have about COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Installing the Environment\n\nFirst, we need to install some packages in order to enable some needed functionality for this notebook, in particular around question answering."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install \"git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM.git@0749dcb8fb46dace0d0987d6fdedf5f28120a461\"\n!pip install \"git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git@0cffc6cb1df8782bbf1bbc336807de355687584b\"\n!pip install ipywidgets\n!jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Function and Class Definitions\n\nNext, we define here a set of functions and classes that we will be using later on in the notebook.
