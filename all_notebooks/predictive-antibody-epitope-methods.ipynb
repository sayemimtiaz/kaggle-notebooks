The authors investigated the extent to which information about binding specificity implicitly encoded in amino acid sequence can be leveraged to identify antibody epitopes.\n\nIn computationally-driven epitope localization, possible antibody–antigen binding modes are modeled, and targeted panels of antigen variants are designed to experimentally test these hypotheses. Prospective application of this approach to two antibodies enabled epitope localization using five or fewer variants per antibody, or alternatively, a six-variant panel for both simultaneously.\n\nRetrospective analysis of a variety of antibodies and antigens demonstrated an almost 90% success rate with an average of three antigen variants, further supporting the observation that the combination of computational modeling and protein design can reveal key determinants of antibody–antigen binding and enable efficient studies of collections of antibodies identified from polyclonal samples or engineered libraries.\nhttps://elifesciences.org/articles/29023"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Overview of computationally-driven epitope identification by EpiScope.\n\n(A) Ab–Ag docking models are generated using computational docking methods.

The PentaFOLD 3.0 algorithm was designed to check stability of alpha helices, beta strands, and random coils using several propensity scales obtained during analysis of 1730 3D structures of proteins.\n\nObjective: The algorithm has been tested in the three peptides known to keep the secondary structure of the corresponding fragments of full-length proteins: the NY25 peptide from the Influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin, the SF23 peptide from the diphtheria toxin, the NQ21 peptide from the HIV1 gp120; as well as in the CC36 peptide from the human major prion protein.\n\nMethod: Affine chromatography for antibodies against peptides accompanied by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to check the predictions of the algorithm.\n\nResult: Immunological experiments showed that all abovementioned peptides are more or less immunogenic in rabbits. The fact that antibodies against the NY25, the SF23, and the NQ21 form stable complexes with corresponding full-length proteins has been confirmed by affine chromatography.

Larsen et al. trained a HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL (HMM) on epitopes in conjunction with random amino acid sequences. The antigenicity of amino acids was then derived from the ratios of their emission probabilities by the epitope HMM and the random HMM. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of such a classifier in combination with a hydrophobicity scale was 0.671. \n\nSöllner and Mayer used DECISION TREE and NEAREST NEIGHBOR MACHINE LEARNING algorithms.

They reimplemented Chen et al.’s method, which yielded an AUC of 0.717 and an accuracy of 65.65%. The difference compared to the accuracy reported by Chen et al. is probably due to differences in the exact composition of the data set. Results reported by El-Manzalawy et al. confirm the superiority of the subsequence kernel classification.\n\nRubinstein et al. used the NAIVE BAYES MACHINE LEARNING algorithm. Their attributes were the frequencies of amino acids, the structural properties of proteins and a number of propensity scores. With all these attributes, the AUC was 0.55 and the accuracy was 70.6%. If only the best attributes were selected, the AUC and the accuracy increased to 0.59 and 80.4%, respectively. This large increase (in accuracy) may be due to the fact that apparently the whole data set was used in attribute selection instead of only the training set.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3823795/"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.histogram(df1, x=\"parker\", color=\"hydrophobicity\", title='Parker Method Hydrophilic Scale')\nfig.update_layout(hovermode='x')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.violin(df1, y=\"kolaskar_tongaonkar\", color=\"isoelectric_point\", title='Kolaskar and Tongaonkar Antigenicity Scal')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Olga Belitskaya https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/sequential-data/comments\nfrom IPython.display import display,HTML\nc1,c2,f1,f2,fs1,fs2=\\\n'#eb3434','#eb3446','Akronim','Smokum',30,15\ndef dhtml(string,fontcolor=c1,font=f1,fontsize=fs1):\n    display(HTML(\"\"\"<style>\n    @import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=\"\"\"\\\n    +font+\"\"\"&effect=3d-float';</style>\n    <h1 class='font-effect-3d-float' style='font-family:\"\"\"+\\\n    font+\"\"\"; color:\"\"\"+fontcolor+\"\"\"; font-size:\"\"\"+\\\n    str(fontsize)+\"\"\"px;'>%s</h1>\"\"\"%string))\n    \n    \ndhtml('Marília Prata, @mpwolke Was here' )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
