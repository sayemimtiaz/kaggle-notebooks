It's malicious and able to form metastases which makes it especially dangerous. Often a biopsy is done to remove small tissue samples. Then a pathologist has to decide whether a patient has IDC, another type of breast cancer or is healthy. In addition sick cells need to be located to find out how advanced the disease is and which grade should be assigned. This has to be done manually and is a time consuming process. Furthermore the decision depends on the expertise of the pathologist and his or her equipment. Therefor deep learning could be of great help to automatically detect and locate tumor tissue cells and to speed up the process. In order to exploit the full potential one could build a pipeline using massive amounts of tissue image data of various hospitals that were evaluated by different experts. This way one would be able to overcome the dependence on the pathologist which would be especially useful in regions where no experts are available .      \n\n\n## Methods presented in the paper\n\nCollecting information\n\n* In the paper, tissue slices of 162 patients were used all having IDC (113 used for training and 49 for validation)\n* One pathologist was used to determine regions of IDC given a tissue slice \n* evaluation metric: F1 score and balanced accuracy\n* Our goal: Given a patient and a patch of a tissue slice predict whether it contains IDC or not.\n    * 3 possibilities: healthy tissue, IDC, another subtype of breast cancer\n* business case: prediction so far is done manually by pathologists and varies from expert to expert. The goal is to assist with an automatic detection of tumors (not expert dependent). \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What is meant by invasive ductal carcinoma? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"intro\"></a>\n\n<a title=\"Mikael Häggström, M.D. - Author info - Reusing images [CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5)]\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lobules_and_ducts_of_the_breast.jpg\"><img width=\"309\" alt=\"Lobules and ducts of the breast\" style=\"float:left; margin:0px 15px 15px 15px\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Lobules_and_ducts_of_the_breast.jpg/256px-Lobules_and_ducts_of_the_breast.jpg\"></a>\n\n\nThis illustration created Mikael Häggström shows the anatomy of a healthy breast.

As CNNs are translational but not rotational invariant, it's a good idea to add flips during training. This way we increase the variety of our data in a meaningful way as each patch could be rotated as well on the tissue slice. As we are not looking at the whole tissue we are not loosing spatial connections between patches and it's not important that some neighboring patches are rotated in different directions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def my_transform(key=\"train\", plot=False):\n    train_sequence = [transforms.Resize((50,50)),\n                      transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n                      transforms.RandomVerticalFlip()]\n    val_sequence = [transforms.Resize((50,50))]\n    if plot==False:\n        train_sequence.extend([\n            transforms.ToTensor(),\n            transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])\n        val_sequence.extend([\n            transforms.ToTensor(),\n            transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])\n        \n    data_transforms = {'train': transforms.Compose(train_sequence),'val': transforms.Compose(val_sequence)}\n    return data_transforms[key]","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://)![](http://)Furthermore we need to create a dataset that loads an image patch of a patient, converts it to RGB, performs the augmentation if it's desired and returns the image, the target, the patient id and the image coordinates.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class BreastCancerDataset(Dataset):\n    \n    def __init__(self, df, transform=None):\n        self.states = df\n        self.transform=transform\n      \n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.states)\n        \n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        patient_id = self.states.patient_id.values[idx]\n        x_coord = self.states.x.values[idx]\n        y_coord = self.states.y.values[idx]\n        image_path = self.states.path.values[idx] \n        image = Image.open(image_path)\n        image = image.convert('RGB')\n        \n        if self.transform:\n            image = self.transform(image)\n        \n        if \"target\" in self.states.columns.values:\n            target = np.int(self.states.target.values[idx])\n        else:\n            target = None\n            \n        return {\"image\": image,\n                \"label\": target,\n                \"patient_id\": patient_id,\n                \"x\": x_coord,\n                \"y\": y_coord}","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_dataset = BreastCancerDataset(train_df, transform=my_transform(key=\"train\"))\ndev_dataset = BreastCancerDataset(dev_df, transform=my_transform(key=\"val\"))\ntest_dataset = BreastCancerDataset(test_df, transform=my_transform(key=\"val\"))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"image_datasets = {\"train\": train_dataset, \"dev\": dev_dataset, \"test\": test_dataset}\ndataset_sizes = {x: len(image_datasets[x]) for x in [\"train\", \"dev\", \"test\"]}","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at the augmentations:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots(3,6,figsize=(20,11))\n\ntrain_transform = my_transform(key=\"train\", plot=True)\nval_transform = my_transform(key=\"val\", plot=True)\n\nfor m in range(6):\n    filepath = train_df.path.values[m]\n    image = Image.open(filepath)\n    ax[0,m].imshow(image)\n    transformed_img = train_transform(image)\n    ax[1,m].imshow(transformed_img)\n    ax[2,m].imshow(val_transform(image))\n    ax[0,m].grid(False)\n    ax[1,m].grid(False)\n    ax[2,m].grid(False)\n    ax[0,m].set_title(train_df.patient_id.values[m] + \"\\n target: \" + train_df.target.values[m])\n    ax[1,m].set_title(\"Preprocessing for train\")\n    ax[2,m].set_title(\"Preprocessing for val\")","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For validation we have only used the image resizing.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating pytorch dataloaders <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"dataloaders\"></a>\n\nAs the gradients for each learning step are computed over batches we benefit from shuffling the training data after each epoch.

Hence if either the recall or the precision is small, the f1-score will then tend towards the smaller value. Let's pick an example with $recall=0.1$ and $precision=0.6$:\n\n$$ f_{1} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{0.1} + \\frac{1}{0.6}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{10}{1} + \\frac{10}{6}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 6}{70} = \\frac{12}{70} = 0.1714$$\n\nYou can see that the $f1-score=0.1714$ is then shifted towards the smaller value of the recall and not close to the arithmetic mean of $\\mu=0.35$.\n\n### Precision and recall\n\nTo fully understand the f1-score we first need to grasp precision and recall. :-) To be honest...
