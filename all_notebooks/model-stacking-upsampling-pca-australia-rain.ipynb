SGDClassifier had higher recall than the non-upsampled stacked model, but lower accuracy. Our stacked model also had the highest accuracy.\n\nOur upsampled stacked model had some interesting results. Although it was by far the lowest in accuracy, it had a very high recall. Essentially, upsampling caused the model to predict rain far more often than the non-upsampled models. This came at the cost of predicting rain a lot when it wasn't going to happen. Which model to use depends greatly on the circumstances. For example, a meteorologist might prefer to be correct most often, desiring a more accurate model. A single person may want to enjoy surprise sunshine, like myself. \n\nIf I had to choose a single model to keep working with, I would likely pick the non-upsampled stacked model. This model had high accuracy and f1-score, making it reliable and robust. Although we have shown how accuracy can be a dangerous metric, it is also the easiest to understand and explain. In the case of predicting something non-critical such as rainfall, it is safe to not worry so much about recall. If we were predicting something rare, yet dangerous, like fraud or cancer, we would definitely want to use upsampling to improve recall."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Next Steps\n\nRecall that we did not optimize the hyperparameters of our base learners. This would most likely lead to overall improved performance at the cost of time. Another optimization could be using more base learners, again at the cost of time.\n\nFurthermore, we could attempt to use other metrics to measure performance, such as roc-auc."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Thank you!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
