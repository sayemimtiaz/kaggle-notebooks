Introduction\n\nHacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n\nThe original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), but note that it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n\n* id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n* title: The title of the post\n* url: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n* num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n* num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post\n* author: The username of the person who submitted the post\n* created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#opening the hacker news dataset\nfrom csv import reader\nopened_file = open('../input/hacker-news/hacker_news.csv')\nread_file = reader(opened_file)\nhn = list(read_file)\nprint(hn[:5])\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#cleaning the data by removing the header row\nheaders = hn[0]\nhn = hn[1:]\nprint(\"headers: \", headers, \"\\n\")\nprint(\"First Five Rows: \", hn[:5])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. Objectives:\n\nFor this analysis, We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. Users often submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Below are a couple examples:\n\n`Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\nAsk HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\nAsk HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?`\n\nLikewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. Below are a couple of examples:\n\n`Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\nShow HN: Something pointless I made\nShow HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm`\n\nWe'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n\n* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#categorizing posts based on Ask and Show HN\nask_posts = []\nshow_posts = []\nother_posts = []\n\nfor row in hn:\n    title = row[1]\n    if title.lower().startswith('ask hn'):\n        ask_posts.append(row)\n    elif title.lower().startswith('show hn'):\n        show_posts.append(row)\n    else:\n        other_posts.append(row)\n        \nprint(\"number of posts asking HN = \", len(ask_posts), \"\\n\",\n      \"number of posts showing HN = \", len(show_posts), \"\\n\",\n      \"number of other posts = \", len(other_posts), \"\\n\",\n     )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.Comparing the averages\nAbove we separated the \"ask posts\" and the \"show posts\" into two list of lists named `ask_posts` and `show_posts`.\nNext, let's determine if ask posts or show posts receive more comments on average."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Finding the total number of comments to 'ask posts'\ntotal_ask_comments = 0\nfor post in ask_posts:\n    num_comments = int(post[4])\n    total_ask_comments += num_comments\n\n#calculating the avergae number of comments on 'ask posts'\navg_ask_comments = total_ask_comments / len(ask_posts)\nprint(\"The average number of comments on ask posts is : \", avg_ask_comments)\n\n# Finding the total number of comments to 'show posts'\ntotal_show_comments = 0\nfor post in show_posts:\n    num_comments = int(post[4])\n    total_show_comments += num_comments\n\n#calculating the avergae number of comments on 'show posts'\navg_show_comments = total_show_comments / len(show_posts)\nprint(\"The average number of comments on show posts is : \", avg_show_comments)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.
