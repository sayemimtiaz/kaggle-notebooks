Data science has been being considered the most direct and reliable way to attack a problem, tracing it to the root and predicting what and when next consequences will take place. This project will follow the same direction and try to solve a specific real-world problem: what can data analytics do to reduce the number of car accidents in the U.S. The analytics will be based on “A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset” by Moosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath. In this project, we will strive for understanding the cause and effect rules of the accidents, and from that, we will try to build several machine learning models that can help with the future accidents forecasting.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2. Problem Definition\n---\n*(Define the problem that will be solved in this data analytics project.)*","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On average, there are 6 million car accidents in the U.S. every year. That's roughly 16,438 per day. Over 37,000 Americans die in automobile crashes per year, and there is an additional 3 million injured or disabled annually. Economically, traffic accidents cost the country $871 billion a year, and that was 6 years ago. These are only a few quick car crash statistics happening right now in the U.S. Even though the country is standing at 110th on the list of countries with the highest traffic-related death rate, the number can still be lowered tremendously if science-based solutions are carried out in a mission to improve the safety of the people on the roads. With a good dataset, data analysis can be an efficient method to extract useful information in order to figure out the cause and effect rules of the accidents, which will result in improved accident prevention.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.

Using Kaggle notebook will solve this problem as we don't have to manually download the dataset to use it. Kaggle allows their users to get access to the datasets available on their website. There are currently about 3.5 million accident records in this dataset. It covers 49 states of the USA, and the data were collected from February 2016 to June 2020, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. Along with the large number of records, this dataset also provide a wide range of attributes for each accident. With 49 columns, analysts can observe and discover many faces of the accidents such as starting-ending time, exact starting-ending location, address, weather conditions, existed crossings, junctions, or bumps, etc. Our goals are planned upon this variety of features. We will also make use of pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, math, and sklearn packages of Python to effectively analyze, visualize, and model our data.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n- Moosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath. “A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset.”, 2019.\n\n- Moosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Radu Teodorescu, and Rajiv Ramnath. \"Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights.\" In proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, ACM, 2019.\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4. The Goal(s) of the predictions\n---\n*(What are the expected results of the project?)*","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The project's mission is to provide assitance for this battle against car accidents with statistics-based findings and data-based analysis. To be more specific, we strive for determining the importance of each attribute toward predicting severity levels of accidents. The process is to create two similar models that predict severity level of available accidents based on a set of attributes. One model will take in all attributes except for the target attribute, for example weather conditions, and the other one will take in every attribute including the target attribute. Two sets of metric scores will be calculated and compared to see if adding the target attribute to the model will improve its performance or hurt it. Additionally, the level of influence of each target attribute will also be evaluated to find out which one plays the most important role and which one plays the least in supporting the performance of the algorithms. The target attributes are:\n\n- Weather Conditions\n- Locations\n- Time of the day\n- Time of the year\n\nFor each attribute, we will create a separate set of models. We will try to implement as many machine learning algorithms as possible. Each of the attribute listed above will be carefully processed and feeded into the models, making sure they retain their full features and hopefully are influential enough to affect the performance of the algorithms for the better or worse.
