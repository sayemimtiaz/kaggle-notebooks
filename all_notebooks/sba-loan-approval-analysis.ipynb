I'm currently working as a Data Scientist in the Finance department for the company I work for, and I wanted to use this as a way to apply some of the things I've been learning.\n\nBecause I'm using this for learning, this will be very detailed as I will be explaining my thought process at each step.\n\n### Why SBA Loan Approval?\nMy first job out of college was at a community bank as a Credit Analyst, where I spent my time underwriting loans for small businesses. I loved being able to dig into the financial statements for each business and see how businesses in different industries operate. This role taught me the importance of small businesses and the role they play in our communities. It also taught me about some of the struggles entreprenuers face when starting a business, including the initial capital necessary to get started.\n\nSmall business owners often seek out SBA (Small Business Association) loans because they guarantee part of the loan. Without going into too much detail, this basically means that the SBA will cover some of the losses should the business default on the loan, which lowers the risk involved for the business owner(s). This increases the risk to the SBA however, which can sometimes make it difficult to get accepted for one of their loan programs. The SBA will play a particularly important role in small business success now with the COVID-19 pandemic which is impacting many small businesses around the world, crippling most of them. I thought it would be interesting to see if I could determine whether or not an SBA loan should be accepted or not given certain characteristics like the industry of the business, the size of the loan, amount of the loan that is guaranteed, etc."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import packages used for analysis\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the SBA loan data and make a copy for exploration\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied/SBAnational.csv')\n\ndf_copy = df.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Exploration\nI begin by taking a look at the data I'll be using for modeling and analysis.\n\n### Data Cleaning, Formatting, and Feature Engineering\nLet's see what we're working with."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_copy.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_copy.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I begin by checking for null values in the dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_copy.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I'm not concerned with ChgOffDate since we're focused on whether or not a loan gets charged off at all rather than when it happens, but the other columns could pose issues.

Although this doesn't quite explain the negative relationship between SBA guarantee percentage and a loan being RevLineCr, what could is the type of SBA loan program used for the loan application. The most common used are the SBA 7(a) and SBA Express programs:\n\n    1. SBA 7(a) program: Provides an 85% guarantee on loan amounts up to 150,000 and a 75% guarantee on loan amounts over 150,000, but require more paperwork from the SBA and the eligibility decision is typically made by the SBA; Turn around time of 5-10 days\n    2. SBA Express: Max loan amount of 350,000 with a guarantee amount of 50%, however the forms required are the lender's own forms and the eligibility decision is made by the lender rather than the SBA; Turn time of about 36 hours\n    \n    Although this dataset unfortunately doesn't contain information on the loan program used for each loan, my assumption is that most businesses elected to use the SBA Express program for revolving lines of credit because it's easier to get loan approval and the turn time is much quicker, meaning the loan guarantee amounts for revolving lines of credit would typically be less.\n    \nOkay, let's look at some graphs of the data.

I know I want to try a Logistic Regression model, and I'd like to try an XGBoost model as well as I know this is currently a popular model to use in Kaggle competitions and generally performs pretty well.\n\nSomething I want to keep in mind when evaluating model performance is that a good accuracy doesn't necessarily mean the model performed well. We need to consider metrics like the precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure we are evaluating model performance based on the 'cost' of the outcomes. For example in this situation, it's better if we predict a loan will default and it doesn't than if we predict a loan will be paid in full and ends up in default. In other words, we want a model that minimizes the number of false negatives (since a 1 in the Default field signifies a 'positive' value in this case). Essentially we want a model that predicts the correct outcome most of the time, but when it gets it wrong it's not as bad.\n\nBut which metric is best for evaluating the model then? Borrowing definitions of precision and recall from Google's Machine Learning Crash Course (found at https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall), precision attempts to answer what proportion of positive identifications was actually correct, whereas recall attempts to answer what proportion of actual positives was identified correctly. The F1-score is a weighted average of precision and recall. General accuracy therefore is better if the outcomes have similar costs, however F1-score should be relied on more heavily if the outcomes have different costs as is the case in this scenario."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# One-hot encode categorical data\ndf_copy = pd.get_dummies(df_copy)\n\ndf_copy.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Establish target and feature fields\ny = df_copy['Default']\nX = df_copy.drop('Default', axis=1)\n\n# Scale the feature values prior to modeling\nscale = StandardScaler()\nX_scaled = scale.fit_transform(X)\n\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.25)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Initialize model\nlog_reg = LogisticRegression(random_state=2)\n\n# Train the model and make predictions\nlog_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_logpred = log_reg.predict(X_val)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(classification_report(y_val, y_logpred, digits=3))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see here that with the Logistic Regression model, we have a decent accuracy at 87.5%, however the F1-score of 68.4% for defaulted loans does not seem very promising.

Further analysis could be done in this area, and I may revisit this at a later date and see if binning the loan term length will prove more valuable in modeling. The term of the loan is typically tied to the size of the loan, which was also selected as one of the most important features in determining whether or not a loan will be paid in full. There are a number of other factors that I was unable to consider for this analysis that I believe would be beneficial, such as which of the SBA loan programs each loan fell under. I could certainly go back and address some of the existing outliers and skewness in some of the features, and would also consider looking at other types of models and will be interested to play with the hyperparameters of the models when I look at this again in the future.\n\nDespite all of the data provided here, there is something else that isn't captured in this data that is arguably the most important and relevant factor in determining the ability of a business to repay the loan: the business owner(s) and the business operations themselves! Although the industry does have some weight in this aspect, the data doesn't include the cash flow of each business, working capital, existing debt they had prior to applying for the SBA loan, etc. The data also can't capture the personality, attitude and drive of a business owner to make the business successful. One of the most important factors we used when underwriting loan applications during my time as a Credit Analyst was the character of the business owner(s). A business can be very successful, but at the end of the day if the owner doesn't want to pay the loan they won't. It's a sad truth, but it happens more often than you'd think.\n\nIf you've read this far, thanks for taking the time to look at my analysis! As mentioned, I will likely revisit this to dig deeper as I sharpen my skillset. I certainly learned a lot working through this, and I hope you're able to take something away from this as well."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
