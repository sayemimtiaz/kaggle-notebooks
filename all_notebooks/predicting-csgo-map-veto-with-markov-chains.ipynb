It was scraped off using the libraries 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup'.\n\nAt any given time, there are 7 maps in the competitive map pool in CSGO. At the moment, those maps are: 'Dust 2', 'Inferno', 'Mirage', 'Nuke', 'Overpass', 'Train' and 'Vertigo' ('Cache' and 'Cobblestone' were the two other maps that were once part of the competitive pool). CSGO Matches are normally played as a 'bo3' (Best of 3 maps), with less important matches played in a 'bo1' fashion and finals often played as 'bo5's.\n\nTo determine the maps to be played in a match, there is a veto system, where both teams take turns, in alternating fashion, removing and picking maps they want or don't want to play. This veto system is what I am going to simulate in this notebook. For that, I am using an ELO-like model to express teams' willingness to play a map in a 1-5 scale (1 meaning the team only plays that map, 5 meaning the team has never played that map). These 'map ELOs' serve to indicate the probability of the team to pick a map in a round of the veto.\n\nWhile it is simple to predict the first veto in the veto process, there is an increasing difficulty to predict each subsequent veto, as every future probability event depends on past events. As an example, if Team 1 removes 'Mirage' in the first veto round in a match where both teams had 90% probability of removing 'Mirage', Team 2's probability of removing 'Mirage' drops to 0%, as the map has already been removed. Also, while all other maps had a combined 10% probability of being removed in Team 2's first round if Team 2 had the first veto, these other maps now have a combined 100% probability of being selected in the second round. \n\nLuckily, there are only 6 rounds in the veto process of CSGO, as otherwise it would be really hard to compute the probabilities in the 12th round using this method.\n\nTo determine if the probabilities estimated actually mean anything, there is a section at the end that compares the probabilities attributed to a map veto occuring and the percent of times this map veto actually occurred.\n\nWell, let's get started!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preparation"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Importing necessary libraries and loading the veto DataFrame."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom os import listdir\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns',100)\n\nlistdir('../input/csgo-professional-matches/')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"base_dir = '../input/csgo-professional-matches/'\n\nveto_df = pd.read_csv(base_dir+'picks.csv',low_memory=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reversing the rows in the DataFrame so that the DataFrame is sorted in ascending order by date.\n\nveto_df = veto_df.iloc[::-1]\nveto_df.index = range(1,veto_df.shape[0]+1)\nveto_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first team in the veto process is stored in the 'team_1' column.
