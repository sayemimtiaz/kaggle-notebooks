{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Trump's Twitter History: Data Cleaning\nThose reading this will already be familiar with the political career of Donald Trump, and will no doubt understand the level of influence his twitter account, as well as his television interviews and meetings with the press had in communicating his political message. Often, his tweets were headline news in publications around the globe, and were not uncommon to captured the attention of the world. His twitter account was suspended as of January 8th, 2021, and has not been renstated as of March 19th, 2021.  \nHis complete twitter history has been archived thanks to https://www.thetrumparchive.com/, which I have used as my source of data for the following notebooks.\n  \nWhy take the time to preform an overview analysis of Trump's twitter career? Well, most influencial political leaders of the past are nearly completly lost to history. How many speechs of Roman emperors do you know? How many of there speeches even remain?  \nThus this dataset is, in an way, a historical artifact. We, as data scientists/data analysts, have a chance observe and study this political artifact before it is lost to the memory of human kind. In addition, analysing this dataset allows us to imagine how political leaders of the future will use their rising technological powers to rule the populos of the future.  \n  \nHaving said that, this series of notebooks will serve more so as an investigation of modern natural language processing and data analisys techniques. Both experimental and fundemental, to see what insights we can extract from a twitter account alone.   \n\nIf the reader has any questions or comments, big or small, feel free to leave them on this thread and I will do my best to answer them in a timely manner. The notebook is ment to be readable on its own, but do let me know if anything is unclear.\n  \nThe most interesting of questions, that off the so called 'ratio', cannot be discussed here as per number of responses were not recorded in the original data set, and may now be lost to time forever. If there are any enterprising readers out there who may know how to get there hands on such data, you may hold the answers to the most interesting questions of all.
