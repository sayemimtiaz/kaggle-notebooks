Neurosci., 28 February 2019 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00135\n\nSurvival from symptom onset ranges from 3 to 5 years depending on genetic, demographic, and phenotypic factors. Despite tireless research efforts, the core etiology of the disease remains elusive and drug development efforts are confounded by the lack of accurate monitoring markers. \n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, the main barrier to the development of validated diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring indicators stem from limited sample sizes. The combination of multiple clinical, biofluid, and imaging biomarkers is likely to increase the accuracy of mathematical modeling and contribute to optimized clinical trial designs.\n\nML methods utilized in ALS research. These include Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Boosting methods, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Generalized linear regression models, Latent Factor models and Hidden Markov Models

Nodes are fed by input with un-shaded arrows. At layer 1, the three features are combined linearly to compute three node values, C1, C2, and C3. C1 is a linear combination of age and delay, C2 is a linear combination of age, delay and BMI, and C3 is a linear combination of BMI and delay. For patient 0, computing the three values returns 10, 2, and 2 for C1, C2, and C3, respectively.

For patient 0, computing the two values gives 24 and 14 for CA and CB, respectively. Model output is computed after computing linear combination of CA and CB and applying a non-linear function (in this case a maximum function which can be seen as a thresholding function which accepts only positive values).
