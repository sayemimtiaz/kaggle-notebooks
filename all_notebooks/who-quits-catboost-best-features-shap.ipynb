As an HR analyst one of the key task is to determine which factors keep employees at the company and which prompt others to leave. Given in the data is a set of data points on the employees who are either currently working within the company or have resigned. The objective is to identify and improve these factors to prevent loss of good people.\n\nThis notebook predicts whether or not employee's resign their position at work.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n* Uses CatBoosts, so no manual encoding of categorial values.\n* Find the best features (which is partly how much overtime work you put on).\n* Plots SHAP values for a few predictions to show what speaks for and what speaks against resignation.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data loading\n\nWe'll do some simple data loading of the train and test set, encode the targets as numerical values since it's more simplier to work with and put all the data in the dataframe at the end.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\n\npd.reset_option('^display.', silent=True)\n\n# Load data\nX_train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/employee-attrition/employee_attrition_train.csv')\nX_test = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/employee-attrition/employee_attrition_test.csv')\n\n# Make target numerical\nX_train.Attrition = X_train.Attrition.apply(lambda x: 0 if x == 'No' else 1)\n\n# Split target and predictors\ny_train = X_train['Attrition']\nnum_train = len(X_train)\nX_train.drop(['Attrition'], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\ndf = pd.concat([X_train, X_test], ignore_index=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Short EDA\n\nThe data contains 1029 training 441 test samples with information about an employee's current position, their background and whether or not they have resigned their position at any point.

It is in open-source and can be used by anyone. More here: https://catboost.ai/\n\nIt has categorical features support and usually gives excellent results without hyperparameter optimization, so we can pretty much train right away. We set a high number of iterations, in order to train as long as we keep seeing improvements, and so that early stopping (Overfit detector in CatBoost lingo) will kick in should it start to overfit.
