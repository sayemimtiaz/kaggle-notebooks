That swab goes into a tube and is sent to a lab. Some large hospitals have on-site molecular test labs, but most samples are sent to outside laboratories for processing. More on that later.\n\nThat transit time usually runs about 24 hours, but it could be longer, depending on how far the hospital is from the processing laboratory. Once at the lab, the specimen is processed, which means lab workers extract the virus's RNA, the molecule that helps regulate genes. \"That step of cleaning — the RNA extraction step — is one limiting factor,\" says Cathie Klapperich, vice chair of the department of biomedical engineering at Boston University. \"Only the very biggest labs have automated ways of extracting RNA from a sample and doing it quickly.\"\n\nAfter the RNA is extracted, technicians also must carefully mix special chemicals with each sample and run those combinations in a machine for analysis, a process called polymerase chain reaction, which can detect whether the sample is positive or negative for COVID.\n\n\"Typically, a PCR test takes six hours from start to finish to complete,\" says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Some labs have larger staffs and more machines, so they can process more tests at a time than others. But even for those labs, as demand grows, so does the backlog.\n\nCapacity is expanding, but not fast enough Initially, only a few public health labs and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention processed COVID-19 tests. Problems with the first CDC test kits also led to delays. Now the CDC has a better kit, and 94 public health labs across the country do COVID-19 testing, says Wroblewski. But those labs can't possibly do all that's needed. In normal times, their main function is regular public health surveillance — detecting more common threats such as outbreaks of measles or monitoring seasonal influenza — \"but not to do diagnostic testing of the magnitude that is required in this response,\" she says.\n\n\"A chief medical officer on the East Coast said that, up until two days ago, on average, it was taking 72 hours to get results,\" says Susan Van Meter, executive director of AdvaMedDx, a division of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a device and diagnostics industry trade group. \"That will get better as our member companies come on the market.\" Even so, supply is not keeping up with demand, Roche CEO Severin Schwan told CNBC on Monday. Roche won the first approval from the FDA for a test kit under emergency rules, and it has delivered more than 400,000 kits so far. \"Demand continues to be much higher than supply,\" Schwan told CNBC. \"So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing, but the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/1028731/covid19-tests-select-countries-worldwide.jpg\" alt=\"Statistic: Number of coronavirus (COVID-19) tests performed in the most impacted countries worldwide as of May 19, 2020* | Statista\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:1000px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;\"/>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The Testing and research may directly contribute to delay in turnaround times and clinical trials for other diseases.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\nThe integrity of more than 330,000 clinical trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov remains threatened as the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread globally.

Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential BIOMARKER that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28 cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers. \n\nSerum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). \n\nSerum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea, CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild COVID-19. Glomerular filtration function injury in severe COVID-19 patients should also be considered by clinicians.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv(\"../input/corona-virus-capillary-and-liver-tumor-samples/both_clean_liver_capillary_CoV.csv\")\ndf1.head().style.background_gradient(cmap='PuBuGn')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Let's Wrangle the Web\n\nThe following details are the best to describe and answer the problem statement asked for this question under the UNCOVER COVID-19 Challenge.

The company has stopped enrolling patients in an early-stage trial of fotetuzumab in AML.\n\n<h4> 7. Aduro Biotech </h4> Three clinical trials  \nDisease: Nephropathy, squamous cell carcinoma and bladder cancer  \nDrug: BION-1301 and ADU-S100  \nAction: Delayed enrollment. Aduro now plans to report data from its study of BION-1301 next year, and the start of the first human test of ADU-S100 was also pushed back. The biotech still aims to disclose results from its Phase 2 trial in squamous cell carcinoma later this year, even though the pandemic has affected the study.\n\n\n<h4> 8. Novartis </h4> PARAGLIDE-HF, PARACHUTE-HF and three other trials.  \nDisease: Heart failure, Sjogren's syndrome, Type 1 diabetes and cancer  \nDrug: Entresto, CFZ533 and a cancer radiotherapeutic  \nAction: Paused recruitment and, in one study, treatment. Several trials run by Novartis, one of the largest drugmakers worldwide, are now marked as suspended on clinicaltrials.gov, hinting at the widening impact being felt by even the biggest pharmas. Most notable is an 800-patient Phase 3 study of Novartis' heart failure medicine Entresto.\n\n<h4> 9. Agios Pharmaceuticals </h4> Multiple trials  \nDisease: Pyruvate kinase deficiency, thalassemia, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, cholangiocarcinoma, low-grade glioma and lung cancer  \nDrug: Tibsovo, Idhifa, mitapivat and AG-636  \nAction: Delayed enrollment in some studies and paused enrollment in others.

The early-stage trial is meant to test a targeted theapy for EGFR-positive lung cancer patients.\n\n\n<h4> 11. Calithera Biosciences </h4> Disease: Lung cancer, kidney cancer, breast cancer and cystic fibrosis  \nDrug: talaglenastat and CB-280  \nAction: Delayed start of two studies, paused new patient enrollment in two others. The delays impact four Calithera trials. Dose escalation has been suspended in two combination trials testing talaglenastat with different Pfizer drugs. And Calithera won't start a Phase 2 trial in lung cancer or a Phase 1 study of CB-280 in cystic fibrosis until the third quarter.\n\n<h4> 12. NextCure </h4> Two early-stage studies  \nDisease: Lung cancer  \nDrug: NC318 and NC410  \nAction: Postponed start of two trials.

Boehringer Ingelheim </h4>  Disease: Diabetes, kidney, lung and eye diseases, cancer, cystic fibrosis  \nAction: Suspended patient screening and enrollment. The German pharma has stopped screening and enrollment in more than four dozen studies, including trials of its lung disease drug Ofev and of experimental cancer therapies like xentuzumab. Many of those affected are early stage, testing healthy volunteers, but three are in Phase 3.\n\n<h4> 14. MaxCyte </h4>  Disease: Ovarian cancer and mesothelioma  \nDrug: MCY-M11  \nAction: Delayed completion of a Phase 1 trial. Due to a deprioritization of non-COVID-19 studies at institutions, MaxCyte said \"timelines may be impacted\" for MCY-M11, a cell therapy in testing for ovarian cancer and a form of mesothelioma.\n\n<h4> 15. Trillium Therapeutics </h4>  Two Phase 1 clinical trials  \nDisease: Cancer  \nDrug: TTI-621 and TTI-622  \nAction: Slowdown or pause in new patient enrollment. Trillium is expecting enrollment in the two studies to slow or pause altogether as \"many clinical sites are putting enrollment of new patients on hold.\" The affected drugs, TTI-621 and TTI-622, are the only two Trillium has in human testing.\n\n\n<h4> 16. Fate Therapeutics </h4>  Disease: Cancer  \nAction: Delayed enrollment. Fate said the timelines for many of its ongoing trials will be impaced by \"potential delays or disruptions in patient enrollment and site initiation.\" The drugmaker didn't say which studies will likely be affected, though.\n\n<h4> 17. Novocure </h4>  Disease: Cancer  \nAction: Delayed enrollment and completion of several studies. Novocure didn't provide specifics, but said the pandemic will delay the timing of enrollment and completion of its trials \"by multiple quarters.\" The biotech currently has six studies ongoing.\n\n<h4> 18. BioNTech </h4>  Disease: Cancer, rare and infectious diseases  \nDrug: Eight experimental candidates  \nAction: Postponed start of several trials. BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine efforts have moved to the forefront during the pandemic. But the outbreak has led to delays for several of its other programs for cancer, rare diseases, and influenza.\n\n<h4> 19. CytomX Therapeutics </h4>  Disease: Breast cancer and melanoma  \nDrug: CX-2009 and CX-072  \nAction: Paused new patient enrollment and new site activation; terminated trial. CytomX intends to resume the study of breast cancer drug CX-2009 as soon as possible. But COVID-19 has led CytomX to end its combination study of CX-072 and the immunotherapy Yervoy in melanoma. It will invest resources elsewhere.\n\n\n<h4> 20. Synlogic </h4>  Two clinical trials  \nDisease: Phenylketonuria and cancer  \nDrug: SYNB1618, SYNB1891  \nAction: Delayed enrollment in two clinical trials. Synlogic doesn't expect to enroll patients in a planned Phase 2 trial of its PKU drug SYNB1618 until \"it is safe for patients to enter clinical trial sites.\" Its Phase 1 study of cancer drug SYNB1891 is already underway, but it'll be tough to recruit new patients for the trial, which makes it less likely that Synlogic will report data this year.\n\n<h4> 21. Moderna </h4>   Disease: Rare diseases, cancer and infectious diseases  \nDrug: mRNA-3704, mRNA-3927, mRNA-1653 and mRNA-1944  \nAction: Paused new patient enrollment in several clinical trials. The pandemic has affected several of Moderna's trials. Enrollment in four studies has been suspended, and other ongoing trials may be disrupted because of recruitment delays or problems getting patients their next dose on time during the outbreak.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Conclusions\n\nThe following details mentioned above are fetched from the BioPharma's website.
