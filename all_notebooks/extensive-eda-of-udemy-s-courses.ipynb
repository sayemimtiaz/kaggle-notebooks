Thanks buddy! :)*\n\nUdemy has been on my radar for quite sometime, especially during my late night internet browsing sessions for courses/learning resources/ etc. Always allured by those great Udemy sales and discounts. I think I once bought a cheap course or two which I never ended up using. Maybe their formating is not for me, maybe their courses aren't too great, or maybe I'm just stuck in my analysis paraylsis which I think happens to the best of us.  Most likely their marketing skills/cheap price thought the deal was just too good to pass.\n\nAnyways, I found this dataset so let's see what we can find here. Thank you Larxel for uploading. \n\nFor the most part I'm going to do an EDA on the dataset, and if there is a machine learning problem I could do on this dataset I will do that towards the end, if I got time.
