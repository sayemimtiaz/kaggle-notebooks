In this notebook, I take polished and cleaned chess portable game notation (PGN) and perform different analyses and visualizations on the data. Whether you're a beginner and only know the rules of chess or are a seasoned master, my goal with this notebook is to visualize the data I've compiled in an easy-to-digest manner. <span style=\"color:blue\">The cool visualizations are towards the bottom of the notebook (last two sections), so you should just skip there if you're only here for the visualizations.</span> For those who are here for the notebook's coding aspect, I have linked <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/converting-raw-chess-pgn-to-readable-data\"> Part 1 Notebook</a> here, where I cleaned the data I gathered from <a href=\"https://database.lichess.org/\">https://database.lichess.org/</a>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em; padding-top: 15px\"> <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">A bit about me:</span> I was motivated to complete this project because I am fascinated by the artform and creativity involved in both computer science and chess, and wanted to synthesize two of my favorite hobbies into this visualization project.

An plausible explanation for such a trend is that in many openings like the Sicilian and Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD), the black e pawn will perch itself on e6. White, on the other hand, will typically expand their central control with pawn to e4, even in openings like the QGD (e.g., Grunfeld Defense). White also pushes their pawn to the 5th rank far more than black does, implying that white has an immediate <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">space</span> advantage. </ul>\n    <ul> Bishop: Bishop to c4 is extremely common for white, whereas its counterpart (Bishop to c5) by black is quite uncommon, with Bishop to e7 being the preferred choice for black. This may due to differences in <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">development</span>; white wants to put their light-squared bishop in an attacking position, whereas black would like to first play solid and equalize before launching a counter-attack. Black also tends to <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">fianchetto</span>—putting their bishop on b7/g7 to control the long diagonal—more often than white, supporting the counter-attacking nature of Black. Black also plays b6/g6 more often than white to fianchetto their bishop).</ul>\n    <ul> Knight: Black plays its knight to the 7th rank more often than white, which can be explained by the fact white will oftentimes decide to push its d/e pawn to the 5th rank, gaining space and attacking the knight on the 6th rank, forcing it to retreat. For both sides though, knight moves to the c3/f3/c6/f6 are by far the most common (>50%).</ul>\n    <ul> Rook: Surprisingly, rooks played on the queenside are more common than towards the center, with Rb8/Rc8 being played more often than Rd8/Re8 for black (and the counterpart squares for white are not far behind). </ul>\n    <ul> Queen: Very similar distribution for the white and black player except Qc7 is played a bit more often than Qc2 (Qc7 in the Sicilian is very common). Qd5 and Qa5 are also very common moves for black, perhaps suggesting some type of Scandanavian setup being heavily played in this data.</ul>\n    <ul> King: Pretty much the same. Most king moves are towards the center. </ul>\n</ol>\n    \n<p style=\"font-size:15px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em\"> Finally, I've included a visualization of different squares pieces move to for differently rated players.</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def piece_rating_prob(games, rating_range=[750, 1250, 1750, 2250], castling=False):\n    prob_dict = {}\n    pieces = ['P', 'B', 'N', 'R', 'Q', 'K']\n    pawn = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']\n\n    #chessboard representation in dict form, must recreate each dict b/c of how python dicts work\n    for rating in rating_range:\n        rating_prob_dict = {}\n        for p in pieces:\n            chess_dict = {}\n            for horizontal in pawn:\n                for vertical in range(1, 9):\n                    chess_dict[horizontal+str(vertical)] = 0\n            rating_prob_dict[p] = chess_dict\n        prob_dict[rating] = rating_prob_dict\n\n    r = 0\n    for game in games['PGN']:\n        rating_type = -1\n        for i in range(len(rating_range)):\n            if i == 0:\n                continue\n            try:\n                if games['Average Rating'][r] < rating_range[i]:\n                    rating_type = rating_range[i-1]\n                    break\n            except:\n                print(r)\n                raise Exception(\"Error.\")\n        if rating_type == -1:\n            rating_type = 2250\n        curr_move = False\n        s = \"\"\n        piece_id = \"\"\n        for index in range(len(game)):\n            if game[index] == \" \" and curr_move:\n                curr_move = False\n                if len(s) >= 4:\n                    #
