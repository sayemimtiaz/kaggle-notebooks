It's history goes back a few centuries and it is amazing to see the activity, level and growth of the sport even in these times. We are lucky to be in this special era where we can see the power of marrying technology with sports like chess that have a siginificant element of algorithms, structure and strategy in it.\n\nThe internet and the nature of the game enables it to be easily playable online. Having a fixed set of rules but endless possibilities of moves and games, it is one of the most researched games with a lot of data available.\n\nChess.com https://www.chess.com/ as the name suggests is an extremely popular website where users can play chess online. They have graciously exposed the data of these games for public use. While the entire database is huge, **all games played by Woman Grandmasters (WGM) is available as a Kaggle Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chess-games-of-woman-grandmasters\n\nNote that a woman can be a WGM as well as GM! But men cannot boast of having both these titles :-)   \nYou can read more about these titles here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_titles\n\nThe official FIDE ratings of chess players are also available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chess-fide-ratings\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## import packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom bokeh.layouts import column, row\nfrom bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, LinearAxis, Range1d, FactorRange, NumeralTickFormatter\nfrom bokeh.models.tools import HoverTool\nfrom bokeh.palettes import Blues9, Greens9, Oranges7, Reds9, Spectral4\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, output_notebook, show\nfrom bokeh.transform import cumsum, dodge\n\noutput_notebook()\n\n## setup configuration, constants and parameters\nPATH_WGM_GAMES = \"../input/chess-games-of-woman-grandmasters/games_wgm.csv\"\nPATH_FIDE_RATINGS = \"../input/chess-fide-ratings\"\n\nMAPPING_MONTH = {\n    1: \"Jan\",\n    2: \"Feb\",\n    3: \"Mar\",\n    4: \"Apr\",\n    5: \"May\",\n    6: \"Jun\",\n    7: \"Jul\",\n    8: \"Aug\",\n    9: \"Sep\",\n    10: \"Oct\",\n    11: \"Nov\",\n    12: \"Dec\"\n}\n\nMAPPING_WEEKDAY = {\n    0: \"Mon\",\n    1: \"Tue\",\n    2: \"Wed\",\n    3: \"Thu\",\n    4: \"Fri\",\n    5: \"Sat\",\n    6: \"Sun\"\n}\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

Time Control\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CRvx9fg.png)\n\nChess matches are generally time bound. There are various time controls to play chess. These are primarily divided into three formats:\n\n* **Bullet:** Each player gets upto 2 minutes\n* **Blitz:** Each player gets at least 2 minutes and up to 10 minutes\n* **Rapid:** Each player gets at least 10 minutes and up to 60 minutes\n* **Classical:** Each player gets 90 minutes\n\nThere can be slight variations of these times but the order of Bullet < Blitz < Rapid < Classical remains consistent. Classical chess games are usually 90 minutes per player and isn't popular in the online chess world for being too long. Instead there is an alternative called **Daily** where the players are required to play at least one move every 'x' days where x can be chosen while beginning the game.\n\nA time control of the 'x+y' or 'x|y' format indicates a starting clock time of 'x' seconds and an increment of 'y' seconds after each move. So a time control of 180+2 indicates each players gets 3-minutes (180-seconds) on the clock and an increment of 2 seconds is added after each moved is played by the player.\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_time_class =
