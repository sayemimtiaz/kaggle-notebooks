There are 2 types of summary generation mechanisms:\n\n1. ***Extractive Summary:*** the network calculates the most important sentences from the article and gets them together to provide the most meaningful information from the article.\n2. ***Abstractive Summary***: The network creates new sentences to encapsulate maximum gist of the article and generates that as output. The sentences in the summary may or may not be contained in the article. \n\nIn this tutorial we will be generating ***Abstractive Summary***. \n\n#### Flow of the notebook\n\n* As with all the tutorials previously, this notebook also follows a easy to follow steps. Making the process of fine tuning and training a Transformers model a straight forward task.\n* However, unlike the other notebooks, in the tutorial, most of the sections have been created into functions, and they are called from the `main()` in the end of the notebook. \n\nThe notebook will be divided into separate sections to provide a organized walk through for the process used. This process can be modified for individual use cases. The sections are:\n\n1. [Preparing Environment and Importing Libraries](#section01)\n2. [Preparing the Dataset for data processing: Class](#section02)\n3. [Fine Tuning the Model: Function](#section03)\n4. [Validating the Model Performance: Function](#section04)\n5. [Main Function](#section05)\n    * [Importing and Pre-Processing the domain data](#section502)\n    * [Creation of Dataset and Dataloader](#section503)\n    * [Neural Network and Optimizer](#section504)\n    * [Training Model and Logging to WandB](#section505)\n    * [Validation and generation of Summary](#section506)\n6. [Examples of the Summary Generated from the model](#section06)\n\n\n#### Technical Details\n\nThis script leverages on multiple tools designed by other teams. Details of the tools used below. Please ensure that these elements are present in your setup to successfully implement this script.\n\n- **Data**:\n\t- We are using the News Summary dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sunnysai12345/news-summary)\n\t- This dataset is the collection created from Newspapers published in India, extracting, details that are listed below.  We are referring only to the first csv file from the data dump: `news_summary.csv`\n\t- There are`4514` rows of data.  Where each row has the following data-point:\n\t\t- **author** : Author of the article\n\t\t- **date** : Date the article was published\n\t\t- **headline**: Headline for the published article\n\t\t- **read_more** : URL for the article to follow online\n\t\t- **text**: This is the summary of the article\n\t\t- **ctext**: This is the complete article\n\n\n- **Language Model Used**: \n    - This notebook uses one of the most recent and novel transformers model ***T5***. [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)    \n    - ***T5*** in many ways is one of its kind transformers architecture that not only gives state of the art results in many NLP tasks, but also has a very radical approach to NLP tasks.\n    - **Text-2-Text** - According to the graphic taken from the T5 paper. All NLP tasks are converted to a **text-to-text** problem. Tasks such as translation, classification, summarization and question answering, all of them are treated as a text-to-text conversion problem, rather than seen as separate unique problem statements.\n    - **Unified approach for NLP Deep Learning** - Since the task is reflected purely in the text input and output, you can use the same model, objective, training procedure, and decoding process to ANY task. Above framework can be used for any task - show Q&A, summarization, etc. \n   - We will be taking inputs from the T5 paper to prepare our dataset prior to fine tuning and training.    \n   - [Documentation for python](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/t5.html)\n\n![**Each NLP problem as a “text-to-text” problem** - input: text, output: text](https://miro.medium.com/max/4006/1*D0J1gNQf8vrrUpKeyD8wPA.png) \n\t \n\n\n- Hardware Requirements: \n\t- Python 3.6 and above\n\t- Pytorch, Transformers and\n\t- All the stock Python ML Library\n\t- GPU enabled setup \n   \n\n- **Script Objective**:\n\t- The objective of this script is to fine tune ***T5 *** to be able to generate summary, that a close to or better than the actual summary  while ensuring the important information from the article is not lost.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='section01'></a>\n### Preparing Environment and Importing Libraries\n\nAt this step we will be installing the necessary libraries followed by importing the libraries and modules needed to run our script. \nWe will be installing:\n* transformers\n* wandb\n\nLibraries imported are:\n* Pandas\n* Pytorch\n* Pytorch Utils for Dataset and Dataloader\n* Transformers\n* T5 Model and Tokenizer\n\nFollowed by that we will preapre the device for CUDA execeution.

This dataset will be used the the Dataloader method that will feed  the data in batches to the neural network for suitable training and processing. \nThe Dataloader and Dataset will be used inside the `main()`.\nDataset and Dataloader are constructs of the PyTorch library for defining and controlling the data pre-processing and its passage to neural network.

The model has not seen this data during training. \n\n#### Dataloader: Called inside the `main()`\n- Dataloader is used to for creating training and validation dataloader that load data to the neural network in a defined manner. This is needed because all the data from the dataset cannot be loaded to the memory at once, hence the amount of data loaded to the memory and then passed to the neural network needs to be controlled.\n- This control is achieved using the parameters such as `batch_size` and `max_len`.\n- Training and Validation dataloaders are used in the training and validation part of the flow respectively","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a custom dataset for reading the dataframe and loading it into the dataloader to pass it to the neural network at a later stage for finetuning the model and to prepare it for predictions\n\nclass CustomDataset(Dataset):\n\n    def __init__(self, dataframe, tokenizer, source_len, summ_len):\n        self.tokenizer = tokenizer\n        self.data = dataframe\n        self.source_len = source_len\n        self.summ_len = summ_len\n        self.text = self.data.text\n        self.ctext = self.data.ctext\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.text)\n\n    def __getitem__(self, index):\n        ctext = str(self.ctext[index])\n        ctext = ' '.join(ctext.split())\n\n        text = str(self.text[index])\n        text = ' '.join(text.split())\n\n        source = self.tokenizer.batch_encode_plus([ctext], max_length= self.source_len, pad_to_max_length=True,return_tensors='pt')\n        target = self.tokenizer.batch_encode_plus([text], max_length= self.summ_len, pad_to_max_length=True,return_tensors='pt')\n\n        source_ids = source['input_ids'].squeeze()\n        source_mask = source['attention_mask'].squeeze()\n        target_ids = target['input_ids'].squeeze()\n        target_mask = target['attention_mask'].squeeze()\n\n        return {\n            'source_ids': source_ids.to(dtype=torch.long), \n            'source_mask': source_mask.to(dtype=torch.long), \n            'target_ids': target_ids.to(dtype=torch.long),\n            'target_ids_y': target_ids.to(dtype=torch.long)\n        }","metadata":{"id":"932p8NhxeNw4","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-26T05:26:44.416003Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-26T05:26:44.41626Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-26T05:26:44.430469Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-26T05:26:44.416235Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-26T05:26:44.429654Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='section03'></a>\n### Fine Tuning the Model: Function\n\nHere we define a training function that trains the model on the training dataset created above, specified number of times (EPOCH), An epoch defines how many times the complete data will be passed through the network. \n\nThis function is called in the `main()`\n\nFollowing events happen in this function to fine tune the neural network:\n- The epoch, tokenizer, model, device details, testing_ dataloader and optimizer are passed to the `train ()` when its called from the `main()`\n- The dataloader passes data to the model based on the batch size.\n- `language_model_labels` are calculated from the `target_ids` also, `source_id` and `attention_mask` are extracted.\n- The model outputs first element gives the loss for the forward pass. \n- Loss value is used to optimize the weights of the neurons in the network.\n- After every 10 steps the loss value is logged in the wandb service.

The BJP leader, who was confident of a good show by his party in the MCD polls, the results of which will be declared tomorrow, said the civic bodies needed to be \"revamped\" in order to deliver the services to the people more effectively. The first thing needed was a discussion on the unification of the three municipal corporations and there should also be an end to the practice of sending Delhi government officials to serve in the civic bodies, said the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports. \"Barring one, the two other civic bodies have been incurring losses. It would be more fruitful and efficient if all the three were merged,\" he said, referring to the north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations. The erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated into NDMC, SDMC and EDMC by the then Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government in 2012. Goel predicted a \"thumping\" victory for the BJP in the MCD polls. He said the newly-elected BJP councillors will be trained on the functioning of the civic bodies and dealing with the bureaucracy. \n\n\n**Original Summary**\nUnion Minister Vijay Goel has favoured unification of three MCDs ?

The department, as part of a special investigation and audit into the account books of AVL, found that an income of over Rs 48,000 crore for a particular assessment year was allegedly not reflected in the record books of the firm and hence it raised a fresh tax demand and penalty amount on it. A Sahara Group spokesperson confirmed the development to PTI. \"Yes, the Income Tax Department has raised Rs 48,085.79 crores to the income of the Aamby Valley Limited with a total demand of income tax of Rs 24,646.96 crores on the Aamby Valley Limited,\" the spokesperson said in a brief statement. Officials said the notice was issued by the taxman in January this year after the special audit of AVLs income for the Assessment Year 2012-13 found that the parent firm had allegedly floated a clutch of Special Purpose Vehicles whose incomes were later accounted on the account of AVL as they were merged with the former in due course of time. The AVL, in its income return filed for AY 2012-13, had reflected a loss of few crores but the special I-T audit brought up the added income, a senior official said.
