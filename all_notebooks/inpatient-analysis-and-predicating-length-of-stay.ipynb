Along these lines, I will create bins of length of stay to construct a new categorical predictor column. Not only do these bins make sense given the fact that there is not a large difference between staying at a hospital for 57 days vs. 58 days, for example, but this will also increase the prediction accuracy of the model I build. This is evident in that the model can now predict a given patient will stay bewteen a given range of days, instead of having to predict an exact number of days. Below, I will perform this construction of new categories","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Label/Predictor Construction**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Summary of findings from this section:\n\nFrom the exploratory data analysis section of this project, I discovered the huge class imbalance present in the dataset given that most of the length of stays are clustered in the 1-5 day range\nClass imbalance can have significant negative effects of model performance. For example, model accuracy can be misleadinly high if the model simply only predicts the classes that appear alot, in the process disregarding features that may point to that data row belonging to another, less common class. I find that this is the case with my models.\nIn this section, I attempt to deal with this class imbalance in a few different ways after observing the affects of this class imbalance on model performance. These effects are dicussed in this section.\nAfter trying numerous different labeling schemes that involves length of stay bins of different sizes, and different numbers of length of stay bins that allowed for more/less specificty in predictions, I came to an optimal binning format that had a high accuracy score for most models trained on it, while not losing large amounts of specifity in predictions\nThe bins I decided to use for my final models are listed here: [0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-13, 13-20, 20-50, 50-120+] where all units are in days\nThis bin format results in a baseline accuracy of 1/7, or ~14.3% accuracy if the model were to guess randomly\nBelow shows some snippets of the iterative process I went through in order to determine this optimal bin format\n\nAs I create these categories, I will keep in mind that I want to create a somewhat even distribution of the number of data rows within each bin. The below label construction was made with the fact that small differences in length of stay matter less for patients who have long lengths of stay than for patients who are only staying 1 or 2 days. In other words, the difference between staying at a hospital for 1 day versus 2 days is more significant than staying 119 days vs. 120 days","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"bins = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,60,70,80,90,100,120]\nencoded_df['stay_bin']=pd.cut(x = encoded_df['Length of Stay'],\n                        bins = bins)\nencoded_df['stay_label']=pd.cut(x = encoded_df['Length of Stay'],\n                        bins = bins,\n                        labels = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23])\nencoded_df['stay_bin'] = encoded_df['stay_bin'].apply(lambda x: str(x).replace(',',' -'))\nencoded_df['stay_bin'] = encoded_df['stay_bin'].apply(lambda x: str(x).replace('120','120+')) #make this bin more descriptive\ndisplay(encoded_df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I visualize my new class distribution below","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20, 15))\nsns.countplot(x='stay_bin', data = encoded_df)\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.title('Class Distribution')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's run another decision tree classifier and see how much our classification improves now with these bins","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n#create train and test sets\nnew_X = encoded_df.drop(['Length of Stay','Total Charges','Total Costs','stay_bin','stay_label'], axis=1)\nnew_y = encoded_df[['stay_label']]\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_X, new_y, test_size=0.3)\n\n#perform pca\n#from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n#from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nx_train = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X_train)\nx_test = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X_test)\n\npca = PCA(n_components=29) #50 components, as found above\nx_train = pca.fit_transform(x_train)\nx_test = pca.transform(x_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We are getting a similar accuracy as with our decision tree above.
