This also has a devastating effect on Airbnb business by scaling back travels as the virus spreads. With the progress of the vaccination throughout the country and some marketing strategies that Airbnb adopted, I wonder if there are traces of economic recovery that recent datasets from Airbnb can reveal.\n\n## Prior research\n\nAccording to a recent report, bookings on Airbnb slumped from 96% to 41% since January 2020 due to travel restrictions imposed by many countries because of the pandemic (lionel Lairent, [Airbnb may become obsolete depending on recovery of tourism after Covid-19 crisis](http://theprint.in/economy/airbnb-may-become-obsolete-depending-on-recovery-of-tourism-after-covid-19-crisis/394346/)). This validates our basic assumption that there is a significant impact on Airbnb listings by the pandemic. This also serves as a qualitative baseline for the analysis in this notebook.\n\nPrior research published in April 2021 showed Airbnb lost hosts throughout the pandemic, particularly those listings with only one property (Laura Forman, [Companies Cheered by Post-Covid-19 Demand Have a Supply Problem](http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-cheered-by-post-covid-19-demand-have-a-supply-problem-11619436602)). In this study, we will analyze the current weight of one-property listings among all and try to evaluate changes in this category.\n\nIn the recent report from Airbnb in 2021 February, they provided a critical and urgent social safety net to help new hosts with only one listing to help stay economically afloat. In the US, they could earn \\\\$3,900, almost twice as much as what has been made available via stimulus checks to date. (Airbnb, [New Airbnb Hosts Have Earned \\\\$1 Billion During the Pandemic](http://news.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/02/New-Hosts-Earnings-Report-Airbnb.pdf?v2)). This subsidy strategy may stimulate one-property listings to recover, and I will validate this conjecture in my data analysis. \n\n## Dataset profile\nThese datasets are part of Airbnb Inside that were scraped each month from October 2020 to March 2021, and the original source can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). They are available under a Public Domain Dedication license, so there is no restriction to use them. \n\nThe 6 datasets for Seattle will be used in this notebook:\n\n* listings_October_2020.csv, listings_November_2020.csv, listings_December_2020.csv, listings_January_2021.csv, listings_February_2021.csv, listings_March_2021.csv  - summary information on listing in Seattle such as location, host information, review information, amenities, etc.\n\nThese datasets are interesting to me because I would like to explore the variations of the Airbnb listings in Seattle and observe possible correlations with economic recovery after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n## Project plan\n\nIn this mini project, I will analyze\n* How is the number of listings change depending on the time of this half a year?\n* How prices change depending on the time of this half a year?\n* How is the weight of one-property listings among all?\n* Does the Airbnb marketing strategies effectively improve the hosting situation with only one listing?\n\nTo this end, I will focus on analyzing **host_id**, **price**, **calculated_host_listings_count** to explore my questions. To clarify, calculated_host_listings_count is defined by the number of listings the host has (per Airbnb calculations).\n\nI will use aggregation, comparisons, and descriptive statistics to analyze listings offered by different types of hosts (e.g., one-property or multi-property), price change, and customer engagement via reviews on Airbnb during the last half a year, and visualize the findings via different types of charts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import all necessary modules and initialize the plot style.\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import style\nstyle.use('ggplot')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.600217Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.600509Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.605562Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.600486Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.604738Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Prepare the data\n\nWe first load the listing and pricing data for each month from 2020 Q4 and 2021 Q1.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data_by_month = {}\nmonths = ['October_2020', 'November_2020', 'December_2020', 'January_2021', 'February_2021', 'March_2021' ]\nfor month in months:\n    file_path = '../input/seattle-airbnb-seasonal-data/listings_' + month + '.csv'\n    data_by_month[month] = pd.read_csv(file_path)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.606519Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.60671Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.717468Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.60669Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-24T04:47:27.716628Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.
