Bike Share Data Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T11:39:20.58359Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T11:39:20.584159Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T11:39:20.588888Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T11:39:20.58411Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T11:39:20.587769Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import time\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nCITY_DATA = { 'chicago': '/kaggle/input/udacity-us-bikeshare-data/chicago.csv',\n              'new york city': '/kaggle/input/udacity-us-bikeshare-data/new_york_city.csv',\n              'washington': '/kaggle/input/udacity-us-bikeshare-data/washington.csv' }\n\n#where\ncities=['chicago','new york city','washington']\nmonths=['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July','August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December','All']\ndays=['Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday','All']\n\ndef get_filters():\n    \"\"\"\n    Asks user to specify a city, month, and day to analyze.\n\n    Returns:\n        (str) city - name of the city to analyze\n        (str) month - name of the month to filter by, or \"all\" to apply no month filter\n        (str) day - name of the day of week to filter by, or \"all\" to apply no day filter\n    \"\"\"\n    print('Hello!
