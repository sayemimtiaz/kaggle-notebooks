This makes it easier for our learning algorithm to work with them since all features have the same 'scale'. In raw data, age and economic indicators such as the euribor rate might have very different ranges. While age has values between 20 and 100, the euribor will never be this high. The learning algorithm might then detect stronger or weaker correlations between certain variables just because their scales are very different. When all input features have the same mean and standard deviation, this hurdle is resolved. We can also picture this graphically. Remember that our learning algorithm is using gradient descent to optimize parameters for a minimum loss. If the 'valley' is very narrow it can be hard to find the minimum as the learning algorithm is often jumping over it. Feature scaling makes the valley more round and therefore easier to find the minimum.\n![feature scaling](https://storage.googleapis.com/aibootcamp/Week%202/assets/feature_scaling.jpg)","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"80e3b22571e1ac9cc751a2c3cdaa2df0f0583832","_cell_guid":"0278918c-bf7c-40a1-a4f5-9eaef5acf834"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Days since last contact\nThe number of days that passed since the customer was last contacted. 999 means they where not contacted before.

You have learned about dummy variables, feature scaling and how clever feature engineering can get better results out of the data. Data preprocessing actually makes up for the majority of time engineers spend when they build industry applications. It can easily make the difference between a well working system and one that does not work at all. Sometimes, it makes sense to come back to the feature engineering step after you have tried out some models. Often, insights from model building help you to do your feature engineering even better. And perhaps you have find something that could be done better in this chapter. If so, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/JannesKlaas/MLiFC) so we can improve. In the next chapter we will build a model on top of our processed data.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"anaconda-cloud":{}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
