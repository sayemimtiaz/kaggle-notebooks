Research in the subject matter was fast-tracked to such a point that scientists were struggling to keep up with new findings. With this increase in the scientific literature, there arose a need for organizing those documents. We describe an approach to organize and visualize the scientific literature on or related to COVID-19 using machine learning techniques so that papers on similar topics are grouped together. By doing so, the navigation of topics and related papers is simplified. We implemented this approach using the widely recognized CORD-19 dataset to present a publicly available proof of concept.}, \n\tbooktitle = {Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering 2020},\n\tarticleno = {15}, \n\tnumpages = {4}, \n\tkeywords = {clustering, document visualization, COVID-19, dimensionality reduction}, \n\tlocation = {Virtual Event, CA, USA}, series = {DocEng '20} }\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Goal\nGiven the large number of literature and the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is difficult for health professionals to keep up with new information on the virus. Can clustering similar research articles together simplify the search for related publications? How can the content of the clusters be qualified?\n\nBy using clustering for labeling in combination with dimensionality reduction for visualization, the collection of literature can be represented by a scatter plot. On this plot, publications of highly similar topics will share a label and will be plotted near each other. In order, to find meaning in the clusters, topic modeling will be performed to find the keywords of each cluster.\n\nBy using Bokeh, the plot will be interactive. Users will have the option of seeing the plot as a whole or filtering the data by cluster. If a narrower scope is required, the plot will also have a search function that will limit the output to only papers containing the search term. Hovering over points on the plot will give basic information like title, author, journal, and abstract. Clicking on a point will bring up a menu with a URL that can be used to access the full publication.\n\nThis is a difficult time in which health care workers, sanitation staff, and much other essential personnel are out there keeping the world afloat. Sitting at home has given us time to try to help in our own way. We hope that our work will have some impact on the fight against COVID-19. It should be noted, however, that we are not epidemiologists, and it is not our place to gauge the importance of these papers. This tool was created to help make it easier for trained professionals to sift through many, many publications related to the virus, and find their own determinations.\n\n\n#### We welcome feedback so that we can continue to improve this project.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Approach:\n\n- Parse the text from the body of each document using Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n- Turn each document instance di into a feature vector Xi using Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).\n- Apply Dimensionality Reduction to each feature vector Xi using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to cluster similar research articles in the two-dimensional plane X embedding Y1.\n- Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project down the dimensions of X to several dimensions that will keep .95 variance while removing noise and outliers in embedding Y2.\n- Apply k-means clustering on Y2, where k is 20, to label each cluster on Y1.\n- Apply Topic Modeling on X using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover keywords from each cluster.\n- Investigate the clusters visually on the plot, zooming down to specific articles as needed, and via classification using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\n\n<br>\n<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n1.

Conclusion\nIn this project, we have attempted to cluster published literature on COVID-19 and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for visualization purposes. This has allowed for an interactive scatter plot of papers related to COVID-19, in which material of similar themes is grouped. Grouping the literature in this way allows for professionals to quickly find material related to a central topic. Instead of having to manually search for related work, every publication is connected to a larger topic cluster. [...]\n \nThe clustering of the data was done through k-means on a pre-processed, vectorized version of the literature’s body text. As k-means simply split the data into clusters, topic modeling through LDA was performed to identify keywords. This gave the topics that were prevalent in each of the clusters.\n\nK-means and t-SNE were able to independently find clusters, showing that relationships between papers can be identified and measured. Papers written on highly similar topics are typically near each other on the plot and bear the same k-means label. However, due to the complexity of the dataset, k-means and t-SNE will sometimes arrive at different decisions. The topics of much of the given literature are continuous and will not have a concrete decision boundary. In these conditions, our approach performs quite well to organize the literature by similarity. \n\n- Look at clusters\n- Look at titles/abstract to see that they are similar\n- Use classification to see if k-means found effective decisions\n\nAs neither of the authors is qualified to assess the meaning of the literature, the analysis by inspection was performed solely on the titles. Even so, it was apparent that articles on key topics could be easily found near each other. For example [MASK CLUSTER EXAMPLE FROM FINAL PLOT].  We believe that health professionals can use this tool to find real links in the texts. By organizing the literature, qualified people can quickly find related publications that answer the task questions. \n\n\"This project can further be improved by abstracting the underlying data analysis techniques as described in this notebook to develop a user interface/tool that presents the related articles in a user-friendly manner.\"\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Some areas we thought were great:** (pros)\n- The tool is saved as an HTML file. It can be downloaded and used locally/offline.\n- It is portable/mobile, easily deployable, and failover safe; the risk of denial of service in the case of emergencies such as the loss of network connection is mitigated\n- Dimensionality reduction allows for the whole dataset to be easily accessible. The papers are all up on the plot and can be quickly examined by hovering over them. If the abstract seems interesting, the user can click on the point to bring up a text box with more information that will contain a link to the full paper\n- Patterns in the data found through clustering/dimensionality reduction may not be readily apparent to researchers. These unsupervised techniques can show humans hidden connections in the literature\n- If the topics/clusters are not narrow enough for the user, a search for a key term will only bring up papers that contain the search term. Search can be performed inside of a selected cluster or the entire dataset if preferred.\n- A surface-level examination of the plot showed some very interesting organization of the data. For example, one subcluster consisted of papers that tried to determine the efficacy of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19.\n- This work can be easily replicated and modified as needed, serving as a foundation for future projects.\n\n<br>\n\n**Future thoughts to consider:** (cons)\n- Possible false positives, difficult to draw an exact line between subjects\n- K-means and t-SNE are unsupervised approaches that will not necessarily predictably group instances. Due to their unsupervised nature, this is not an exact science \n- Not labeled data; no certainty.\n- No in between, clustering either looks ok or is very wrong\n- Loss of foreign language papers. This leads to the loss of experience from different geographic locations in dealing with COVID-19\n- The algorithms used in this notebook are stochastic so the results may vary depending on the random state. In this notebook, all of the algorithms are set to random state 42 (the meaning of life) to ensure reproducible results","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Citation/Sources\n\nKaggle Submission: [COVID-19 Literature Clustering | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/maksimeren/covid-19-literature-clustering#Unsupervised-Learning:-Clustering-with-K-Means)\n \n ```\n@inproceedings{Raff2020,\n\tauthor = {Raff, Edward and Nicholas, Charles and McLean, Mark},\n\tbooktitle = {The Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence},\n\ttitle = {{A New Burrows Wheeler Transform Markov Distance}},\n\turl = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13046},\n\tyear = {2020},\n}\n```\n```\n@misc{Kaggle,\n\tauthor = {Kaggle},\n\ttitle = {COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)},\n\tyear = {2020},\n\tmonth = {March},\n\tnote = {Allen Institute for AI in partnership with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown University’s Center for   Security and Emerging Technology, Microsoft Research, and the National Library of Medicine - National Institutes of Health, in coordination with The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.},\n\thowpublished = {\\url{https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge}}\n}\n```\n```\n@inproceedings{Shakespeare,\n\tauthor = {Nicholas, Charles},\n\ttitle = {Mr. Shakespeare, Meet Mr. Tucker},\n\tbooktitle = {High Performance Computing and Data Analytics Workshop},\n\tyear = {2019},\n\tmonth = {September},\n\tlocation = { Linthicum Heights, MD, USA},\n}\n```\n```\n@inproceedings{raff_lzjd_2017,\n\tauthor = {Raff, Edward and Nicholas, Charles},\n\ttitle = {An Alternative to NCD for Large Sequences, Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance},\n\tbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},\n\tseries = {KDD '17},\n\tyear = {2017},\n\tisbn = {978-1-4503-4887-4},\n\tlocation = {Halifax, NS, Canada},\n\tpages = {1007--1015},\n\tnumpages = {9},\n\turl = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3097983.3098111},\n\tdoi = {10.1145/3097983.3098111},\n\tacmid = {3098111},\n\tpublisher = {ACM},\n\taddress = {New York, NY, USA},\n\tkeywords = {cyber security, jaccard similarity, lempel-ziv, malware classification, normalized compression distance},\n}\n```\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n**Thank you for looking at our notebook.
