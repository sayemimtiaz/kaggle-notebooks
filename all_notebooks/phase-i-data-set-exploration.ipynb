Data provenance\nThe available data set was made publicly available by [UnknownClass](http://www.kaggle.com/nphantawee) at [www.kaggle.com/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data](http://www.kaggle.com/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data). The data set comprises a collection of 52 sensors' measurements of a small town water pump system. \n\n## 1.2. Porposed approach\nThe author of the data set has reported ([www.kaggle.com/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data](http://www.kaggle.com/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data)) that the system had 7 system failures over the course of one year, which caused serious living problems to some families. Thus, the problem consists on predicting when will the next failure occur. To this end, a two-phase approach is proposed. First, an exploration of the provided data will take place. The purpose of such exploration is threefold: (1) to get familiar with the data, (2) to assess the _quality_ of data and decide which methodology to employ accordingly, (3) to determine the features of interest. At the end of this first phase, it is expected to have a clean, ready to work data set, which will be used throughout the second phase. In this phase, the predetermined methodology will be implemented to tackle the prediction problem.\n\n# 2. Methodology\n\n## 2.1.

Data set creation for regression problem\n\nIn the previous section, a data exploration took place, from which a set of features of interest were determined. Moreover, based on the data a data set creation methodology was devised. This secion focuses on building such data set.\n\nRecall that during the exploration NaN values were substituted by 0 and data was normalized without great discussion. Such data processing was performed to enable an easy familirisation with data. However, to build a data set one does not want to corrupt data, i.e. one must be very carefull of its pre-processing since the model building methodology is very sensitive to such data manipulations.\n\nTherefore, the data set creation will have a bottoms-up approach, i.e. starting with the raw data, features will be selected and manipulated individually and aggregated at the end.\n\n### 2.2.1. Data imputation\nRecall fom the previous section that the data set at hand had NaN values in every row and collumn. To address this problem, invalid values were substituted by 0. However, that is a poor approach since the system being studied is a continous one. Forcing the time series to switch from a given value to 0 intermittently corrupts the signal, creating patterns that may be learnt by the RNN which would be counter-productive. Thus, the best way to address the problem is to somehow infer from a nieghberhood of values what is the most likely one to appear in place of NaN.\n\nAs a starting point, consider this example. Consider the series defined as follows,\n\n$$\\{1,2,3,4,5,NaN,7,8,9\\}.$$\n\nAny person would be able to infer NaN should be replaced by 6. Several methods were developed to teach a machine to infer the same. Arguably, the most simple one consists on averaging, as follows.\n\nLet $x_i$ represent the sequence element in position $i$. Consider the situation in which a NaN value is at position $i$, i.e. $x_i = NaN$. Then, one can infer is value as follows,\n\n$$x_i = \\frac{x_{i-1}+x_{i+1}}{2}.$$\n\nOn can employ such a method resorting to scikit learn's method [SimpleImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html#sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer), as follows."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# instanciate imputer\nimp = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')\n\nnew_data = imp.fit_transform(df.iloc[:,2:54])  # new_data originates from raw data\nnew_data = pd.DataFrame(new_data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note, however, that the previous method recquires $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$, i.e. it is assumed the previous and the next values of a given NaN are always available. This excludes situations in which there are more than 2 consecutive NaN values. Since in such a big collection of data one can not visualise all data entries, one must assume such situations might occur at some point in the data set.\n\nTo deal with problem, one must resort to more flexible and robust imputation methods, such as interpolations. The interested reader is referred to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation). To employ such methods on the data set in question, one can make use of the pandas' [interpolate](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html#pandas.DataFrame.interpolate) methods. Different methods of interpolation are available, e.g. linear, quadratic, polynomial, etc. To decide which one to choose, one must *see* the actual signal one wants to keep and employ the method that most resembles its trend.\n\nThe figures below represent a chunck of various of the features of interes."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data visualisation imposing machine status information\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(20, 5), dpi=120, nrows=2, ncols=2)\n\nax0 = df.iloc[0:50,2].plot(ax=axes[0,0], legend = 'sensor_00')\nax0.set_xlim([0,50])\nax0.grid()\nax0.set_xlabel('Time [minutes]')\n\nax1 = df.iloc[0:50,6].plot(ax=axes[0,1], legend = 'sensor_04')\nax1.set_xlim([0,50])\nax1.grid()\nax1.set_xlabel('Time [minutes]')\n\nax2 = df.iloc[0:50,8].plot(ax=axes[1,0], legend = 'sensor_06')\nax2.set_xlim([0,50])\nax2.grid()\nax2.set_xlabel('Time [minutes]')\n\nax3 = df.iloc[0:50,9].plot(ax=axes[1,1], legend = 'sensor_07')\nax3.set_xlim([0,50])\nax3.grid()\nax3.set_xlabel('Time [minutes]')\n\nplt.tight_layout","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The measurements seem to follow a linear trend between points, thus one can exploit this information and perform data imputation resorting to linear interpolation, as follows."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def interpol(X):\n    X_interpolled = X.interpolate(method='linear')\n    return X_interpolled","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# new_data originates from raw data\nnew_data = df.iloc[:,2:54].astype(float)\n\n# each independent signal corresponds to a given collumn\nfor i in range(0,52):\n    feat = interpol(new_data.iloc[:,i])\n    new_data.iloc[:,i] = feat\n\nnew_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.2.2.

3. Conclusion\n\nThis work focused on the first of a two phase approach to a failure rediction problem. The devised methodologies focused on data exploration. Two important results were achieved: \n\n1. the features of interest were determined, i.e. the measurements performed by sensors 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11;\n\n2. a set of clean, ready to work data sets, which will be used throughout the second phase were also constructed (please refer to sxx_1.csv, sxx_2.csv, sxx_3.csv, sxx_4.csv, sxx_5.csv, sxx_6.csv). \n\nMoreover, an extra data set (sensor_new_data.csv) was also built, which consists on the 8 features of interes, plus the binary label (machine_status, i.e. either NORMAL, or FAILURE)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
