{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Oil demand is collapsing because of the coronavirus crisis. Supply is shrinking -- but not nearly fast enough. The world is literally running out of room to store unneeded barrels of oil piling up during the coronavirus pandemic. That storage problem is so dire that it caused oil prices to turn negative this week for the first time ever.\n###      The jaw dropping fall in global crude oil prices may seem a bonanza for an oil guzzler like India, but the plunge is set to change the fortunes of many countries across the world. For most the oil exporters, the demand destruction due to COVID-19 and the supply glut are poised to deal a body blow to one of their most lucrative sources of cash. While countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia and US are large enough to manage the crisis, many small exporters in Africa and West Asia may be faced with an acute cash crunch this year. Let's see a detailed look at how the world's economis may be impacted going forward in this notebook.\n![](https://image.freepik.com/free-vector/world-oil-crisis-2020-fall-price-per-barrel-influence-coronavirus-dispute-russia-saudi-arabia-stock-concept-illustration_119217-1046.jpg)\n## How the current oil crisis came about?\n\n*  Wild trading in an oil futures contract has sent the Wild Texas Intermediate crude to unprecedented low of -$40.32\n*  The negative prices meant the holders of the May contract were unable to accept the physical delivery of the oil and they had to pay to get rid of it, as the worls's storage is at bursting point\n*  Storage is a particularly big problem in the US where WTI oil is delivered at a single, island point - the oil storage terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma, labelled the 'Pipeline Crossroads of the world'\n\n| Some major oil storage locations      | Capacity in barrels           |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| \n| Antwerp-Rotterdam-Amsterdam     | 100 mn | \n| Cushing, Oklahoma    | 76.1 mn | \n| South Africa Saldanha | 50 mn   | \n|Egypt terminal at Sidi Kerir | 20 mn|   \n\n------                                                                                                        \n### What is a Future Contract?\n#### Most of the oil trading is in futures, not physical barrels of oil. With such a contract the delivery of the commodity is carried out at a later date. Futures trading help market participants by allowing them to lock into prices, either to sell or buy, but also allows for speculation. \n------\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# World's Largest Oil Producers"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\ncountry_producing = ['United States','Saudi Arabia','Russia','Canada','China','Iraq','UAE','Brazil','Iran','Kuwait']\noil_produced = [19.51,11.81,11.49,5.50,4.89,4.74,4.01,3.67,3.19,2.94]\n\nfig = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=country_producing,\n                             values=oil_produced)])\nfig.update_traces(hoverinfo='label+percent', textinfo='value', textfont_size=20)\nfig.update_layout(title=go.layout.Title(text=\"<b>World's Largest Oil Producers (mn barrels/day)</b>\", font=dict(\n                family=\"Courier New, monospace\",\n                size=22,\n                color=\"black\"\n            )))\n\nfig.update_layout(annotations=[\n       go.layout.Annotation(\n            showarrow=False,\n            text='Source: EIA, 2019 data',\n            xanchor='right',\n            x=0.75,\n            xshift=275,\n            yanchor='top',\n            y=0.05,\n            font=dict(\n                family=\"Courier New, monospace\",\n                size=12,\n                color=\"black\"\n            )\n        )])\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The crisis in the amid the coronavirus crisis was compunded by a price war between Russis and Saudi Arabia, but earlier market turmoil saw them agreeing to cut output.
