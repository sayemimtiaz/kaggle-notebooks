There are two csv files provided that we can use. The first one contains information about the sales of the product types, like the net quantity, gross sale, discount, returns and the net sales. The second contains information about the month, year, total orders, gross sale, net sales, and shipping. We have two files that provide different kinds of information that can be valuable to providing insights about this online business's sales. The visualizations will be in two different sections, product types insights and sales insight. \n\nTo answer the task set by the post, I will also have a section over the projections for Oct- Dec of 2020 using data from previous years. I will try to provide an output of a list of sales by product type. From this, we would be able to see demand by each product type and suggest discounts for the near future."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading the Sales Data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, load the notebook libraries.
