Many games are on multiple platforms, each with their own data entry (e.g., Stardew Valley is on PC, PS4, Switch, and XONE, and thus occupies 4 different rows). The counts of user reviews (e.g., the positive_users columns) refer to how many written reviews there are, not the number of ratings which the user_score is based off of. Unfortunately, the data does not contain the number of user ratings. Also for some reason metacritic ranges critic scores from 0 to 100 and user scores from 0 to 10- thus the user score is multiplied by 10 in this data. \n\nFinally, for qualitative analysis, it's important to keep in mind that metacritic is a much smaller review site than Steam. Of course, Steam only contains reviews for games on its own platform. I'd be very interested in comparing metacritic reviews for games that are on Steam vs. not on Steam, but that is a stretch goal as it would require web scraping Steam reviews. At any rate, the goal of this project is for me to learn some basic Python and data science using this simple dataset rather than form robust conclusions about the gaming industry :)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#SUB-PROJECT 1: create a visualization showing the total percentage of positive/neutral/negative critic scores and user scores\n\n#get the percentage of each review type\npercent_positive_reviews = [df1['positive_critics'].sum()/df1['total_critics'].sum()*100, df1['positive_users'].sum()/df1['total_users'].sum()*100]\npercent_neutral_reviews = [df1['neutral_critics'].sum()/df1['total_critics'].sum()*100, df1['neutral_users'].sum()/df1['total_users'].sum()*100]\npercent_negative_reviews = [df1['negative_critics'].sum()/df1['total_critics'].sum()*100, df1['negative_users'].sum()/df1['total_users'].sum()*100]\n\n#display data\nx_shape = [0,1]\nx_names = ('Critics','Users')\nplt.bar(x_shape, percent_positive_reviews, color='g', edgecolor='white', label = 'Postive reviews')\nplt.bar(x_shape, percent_neutral_reviews, bottom=percent_positive_reviews, color='y', edgecolor='white', label = 'Neutral reviews')\nplt.bar(x_shape, percent_negative_reviews, bottom=np.add(percent_positive_reviews, percent_neutral_reviews), color='r', edgecolor='white', label = 'Negative reviews')\nplt.xticks(x_shape, x_names)\nplt.legend(loc='right', bbox_to_anchor=(1.45, 0.5))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The percentage of positive reviews is actually pretty close.

Diablo III, with 4682 user reviews. \n2. Infestation: Survivor Stories with 1601 user reviews but a metascore of only 20. \n3. The only game with over 1000 reviews and a lower user score than I:SS's 17 is Star Wars Battlefront II on the PS4 with 2331 users and a user score of 11. It also has an entry for the PC and XONE versions.\n\nAll 3 of these games were \"review bombed\" to protest their inclusion of ways to gain gameplay-impacting advantages with real money purchases, i.e., microtransactions. \n1. Top ranked players in Diablo II often bought and sold items through eBay; thus, its successor, Diablo III included a real money auction house within the game. It was removed after community backlash with little long-term damage done, as evidenced by Reaper of Souls (the expansion) selling 2.7 million copies in its first week. \n2. It's hard to tell how much of Infestation: Survivor Stories's rating is due to review bombing as it's widely regarded as a bad game anyway, but many reviews do complain about gameplay-impacting microtransactions.\n3. Star Wars Battlefront II locked playable characters through playtime, a fairly common practice in video games- however, the playtime requirements were unprecedently steep (40 hours for Darth Vader). Alternatively, players could unlock them with real money, which the gaming community viewed as an unethical cash grab. Notably, an EA employee discussing microtransactions in SWBCII holds the most downvoted commented on reddit with roughly 30x more downvotes than second place. Following the controversy, costs of unlocking characters were reduced by 75%, but sales of the game were still significantly affected- some sources report that SWBCII only sold 50% of what analysts expected!\n\nFurther investigation suggests that review bombing is much more common than I had anticipated, and thus my original hypothesis that the number of user reviews is a good indicator of game's sales and active players is incorrect. \n\nInterestingly, the games with the two highest user scores are God of War and The Witcher 3 (with 2500+ reviews each across all platforms). Both clearly merit high marks on gameplay alone; however, perhaps it isn't coincidental that the both of the development teams have been outspoken against microtransactions!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#SUB-PROJECT 5: visualization with rating on the x-axis, and metascore + user score on the y-axis. \n#perhaps I can figure out how to put these both on the same graph maybe with a violinplot where each \"violin\" is split down the middle?\n#Also having trouble putting these side by side. the method I used above doesn't seem to work with seaborn?\n#investigate whether difference in metascore for M and T games is statistically significant\n\n#remove RP and AO due to low sample sizes and investigate correlation between genre and score UNFINISHED\n#clean_ratings = df1[(df1['rating'] == 'E10+') | (df1['rating'] == 'M') | (df1['rating'] == 'T') | (df1['rating'] == 'E')]\n\n#display data\nsns.catplot(x='rating',y='metascore', data = df1, kind=\"boxen\")\nsns.catplot(x='rating',y='user_score', data = df1, kind=\"boxen\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are only 19 games listed as RP (Rating Pending); while the sample size is very low, I would expect this category to have a lower average score since it includes unfinished or cancelled games such as Clockwork Empires.\n\nThere are only two games rated \"AO\" released within the time frame of the data (2011-2019): Hatred for violence, and Seduce Me for sexual content. \n\nOtherwise, it seems that M games average the highest metascore while T games average the lowest.

There are 13 games where the metascore is lower than the user score by 25, whereas there are 227 games (17x!) where the metascore is higher than the user score by the same value of 25 (and at least 5 user reviews). I was surprised at such a huge discrepancy here, so I went back to take a quick look at the correlation and distribution between average metascore vs. user score overall for all 5699 games in the data.\n\n227 games is of course too many, so I looked at games where the metascore is higher than the user score by a whopping 50 points, for which there were 21 games. Looking at these first, I quickly recognized all of them except for Out of the Park Baseball 17. Fortnite is objectively one of the most successful, if not the most successful, game of all time. The rest of these are all AAA titles, and every single one of them was a very successful game with the exception of the aforementioned Star Wars Battlefront II and Artifact, both faltering due to their monetization models rather than gameplay faults. Thus, I have to conclude that most of these games were review bombed. Note how many are EA games- a company that is often despised within the more serious gaming community due to the way they implement microtransactions despite consistently producing best-sellers. Also note that the trend of review bombing and seems to have started in 2017, around the time when companies started to push the envelope with microtransactions.\n\nFor games that users rated higher than critics, 4/13 games are fanservice/sex/dating themed: Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded, Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune, Senra Kagura Reflexions, and Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls. Another 4/13 are horror themed: The Haunted: Hell's Reach, Knock-knock, Crystal Rift, and loosely Immortal: Unchained. Note that sample sizes for these games are much lower; thus, I investigated some expanded data and it definitely seems that a disproportionately high number of games in these two categories are rated low by critics but high by users. Amusingly, Left Alive, released very recently in March of 2019, appears to be the only game I've ever seen that has clearly been reverse-review-bombed; it has a 8.6/10 on metacritic with an extremely high number of ratings (1382), despite a 18% user rating for the PC version on Steam with 347 total reviews.
