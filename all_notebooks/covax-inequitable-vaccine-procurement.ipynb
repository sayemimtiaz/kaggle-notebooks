COVAX has been created to maximise our chances of successfully developing COVID-19 vaccines and manufacture them in the quantities needed to end this crisis, and in doing so ensure that ability to pay does not become a barrier to accessing them.\n\nIt works because:\n- For **lower-income funded nations**, who would otherwise be unable to afford these vaccines, as well as a number of higher-income self-financing countries that have no bilateral deals with manufacturers, COVAX is quite literally a lifeline and the only viable way in which their citizens will get access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n-  For the **wealthiest self-financing countries**, some of which may also be negotiating bilateral deals with vaccine manufacturers, it serves as an invaluable insurance policy to protect their citizens, both directly and indirectly. On the one hand it will provide direct protection by increasing their chances of securing vaccine doses. Yet, at the same time by procuring COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX, these nations will also indirectly protect their citizens by reducing the chances of resurgence by ensuring that the rest of the world gets access to doses too.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How can a country participate?\nBased on the information above, I think you can guess that there are broadly two ways of participating:\n- **Advanced Market Commitment(AMC)** : This scheme supports access to COVID-19 vaccines for lower-income economies. Combined, these make possible the participation of all countries, regardless of ability to pay. Countries participating through AMC can either be on the giving or recieving end.\n- **Self-Financing Countries** : For these countries COVAX serves as a critical insurance policy that will significantly increase their chances of securing vaccines, even if their own bilateral deals fail. And by pooling resources through the Facility, participating countries and economies are essentially helping to increase the world’s chances of bringing about COVID-19 vaccines as quickly as possible.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZgGWXSK.png\">\n</p>\n\n\n\n## How can COVAX ensure quick vaccine procurement?\n> Normally, manufacturers are reluctant to risk making the significant investments needed to build or scale-up vaccine manufacturing facilities until they have received approval for a vaccine. But in the context of the current pandemic, which is costing the global economy US$ 375 billion every month, this would inevitably lead to significant delay and initially vaccine shortages once vaccines are licensed. To avoid this, the COVAX Facility is working with manufacturers to provide investments and incentives to ensure that manufacturers are ready to produce the doses we need as soon as a vaccine is approved. **The Facility will also use the collective purchasing power that comes from having so many countries participate in order to negotiate highly competitive prices from manufacturers that are then passed on to participants.**\n\nNow that we know about COVAX, let's see how the actual vaccine procurement process has been working out using the data collected by the [Duke Global Health
