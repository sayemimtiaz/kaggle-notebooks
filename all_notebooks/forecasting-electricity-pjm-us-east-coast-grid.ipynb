That is, today's value is influenced by, for example, yesterday's value, last week's value etc. This is known as 'autocorrelation' (ie correlating with 'self').\n\nBecause time series has autocorrelation, many traditional machine learning algorithm that consider every data point 'independent' don't work well. That is, every prediction is solely based on a particular day's data, and not what happened yesterday, day before etc.\n\nTo put it bluntly, traditional machine learning algorithms have **no concept of the passage of time - every single data point is just a 'row in the table'.** It doesn't factor into trends, which as humans, we would intuitively see (e.g. sales went up by 20% this week).\n\nGenerally, to make a machine learning model factor data from a particular point's past, you use 'shifting' feature engineering techniques. That is, for example, expressly adding in yesterday's value show as a feature/column for the model to consider.\n\nThis illustration will attempt to forecast energy consumption to give a bit of flavour of how time series forecasting works, comparing:\n\n1. Holtwinters Triple Exponential Smoothing\n2. Seasonal Autoregression Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)\n3. XGBoost Regressor\n4. LASSO Regularised Regression\n5. Facebook’s Prophet\n\n## A showcase of time series forecasting - electricity usage!\nIn the electricity industry, being able to forecast the electricity usage in the future is essential and a core part of any electricity retailer's business. The electricity usage of an electricity retailer's customers is generally known as the retailer's 'load' and the usage curve is known as the 'load curve'.\n\nBeing able to accurately forecast load is important for a number of reasons:\n\n**Predict the future base load** - electricity retailers need to be able to estimate how much electricity they need to buy off the grid in advance.\n**Smooth out pricing** - if the load is known is advance, electricity retailers can hedge against the price to ensure they aren't caught out when the price skyrockets 3 months into the future.\n\nIn a nutshell, the business problem is:\n\n**Given the historical power consumption, what is the expected power consumption for the next 365 days?**\n\nBecause we want to predict the daily load for the next 365 days, there are multiple 'time steps' and this form of forecasting is known as 'multi-step forecasting'. In contrast, if you only wanted to predict the load on the 365th day or the load for tomorrow only, this would be known as a 'one-step forecast'.\n\nThis dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption:\n\n> PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM) is a regional transmission organization (RTO) in the United States.

The general rule of thumb is 5% - which means there's a only a 5% chance of the statistical tests to be incorrect.\n\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n\n'**Stationary**' means the properties of the dataset don't change over time. Non-stationary means the trends, seasonality changes over time and the data is affected by factors other than the passsage of time. A Non-Stationary is sometimes known as a 'Random Walk' - which are notoriously difficult to forecast, because the underlying properties keep changing (e.g. like trying to hit a moving target).\n\nNote that Random Walk is different to a set of 'random numbers' - it's random because the next point is based on a 'random' modification on the first point (e.g. add, minus, multiply). Whereas in a 'random numbers' set, ther would be little relationship between each data

How many degrees of differencing is done to reduce seasonality is the 'order'.\n\n3. **Moving Average** - Uses the Moving Average of the historical data to adjust the forecasted values.

The concept of Bayesian theorem is, at high level, trying to determine the probability of related events given knowledge/assumptions you already know (ie 'priors').\n\nThis is basically fancy talk for saying it focuses on finding a bunch of possible parameters and the probability of each one rather than finding fixed optimal values for the model. How certain (or uncertain) the model is about each possible parameter is known as the 'uncertainty interval' - the less data the model sees, the bigger the interval is.\n\nThe sources of uncertainty that Prophet's Bayesian approach aims to address are:\n\n* Uncertainty of the predicted value\n* Uncertainty of the trend and trend changes\n* Uncertainty of additional noise\n\n## Trends, 'Changepoints' and Seasonality\n\nProphet is different to SARIMA and HoltWinters, as it essentially decomposes time series differently by:\n\n**Data = Trend +/x Seasonality +/x Holidays +/x Noise**\n\nIn Prophet, trend represents non-periodic changes while seasonality represents periodic changes. Where it differs from other statistic models like SARIMA and Holtwinters is Prophet factors in the uncertainty of trends changing.\n\nInterestingly, Prophet fits a curve to each component independently (ie fits a regression for each component with time as independent variable). That is:\n\nTrend - fits piece-wise linear/log curve\nSeasonality - uses fourier series\nHolidays - uses constant/fixed values\nProphet reacts to changes in trends by 'changepoints' - that is sudden and abrupt changes in the trend. An example, is the release of a new electric car that will impact sale of petrol cars.\n\nHow 'reactive'/flexible Prophet is to changepoints will impact how much fluctation the model will do. For example, when the changepoint scale is to very high, it becomes very sensitive and any small changes to the trend will be picked up. Consequently, the sensitive model may detect spikes that won't amount to anything, while an insensitive model may miss spikes altogether.\n\nThe uncertainty of the predictions is determined by the number of changepoints and the flexibility of the changepoint allowed. In other words, if there were many changes in the past, there's likely going to be many changes in the future. Prophet gets the uncertainty by randomly sampling changepoints and seeing what happened before and after.\n\nFurthermore, Prophet factors in seasonality by considering both its length (ie seasonal period) and its frequency (ie its 'fourier order').For example, if something keeps happening every week on Monday, the period is 7 days and its frequency is 52 times a year.\n\nThere's also a function for Prophet to consider additional factors (e.g. holidays), but for the purposes of this forecast we won't use it.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training\nProphet works quite well out of the box, so I just stuck with the default hyperparameters.\n\nThe results can be seen below, with the black dots representing historical points and the blue line representing the prediction:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from fbprophet import Prophet\n\nftrain = train.reset_index().rename(columns={'Datetime':'ds', 'PJME_MW': 'y'}) # Prophet takes ds and y as column names only\n\nmodel = Prophet(\n    n_changepoints=25 # Default is 25\n    ,changepoint_prior_scale=0.05 # Default is 0.05\n    ,seasonality_mode='additive'\n    ,interval_width=0.8 # CI - default is 0.8 or 80%\n)\nmodel.fit(ftrain)\n\n# Create the future dataframe with date range that will be used to test accuracy\nfuture_df = test.reset_index()['Datetime'].to_frame().rename(columns={\"Datetime\":'ds'})\n\n# Predict the future\nforecast = model.predict(future_df)\nPROPHET_prediction = forecast.set_index('ds')[['yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper']][cutoff:]\nPROPHET_prediction = PROPHET_prediction.rename(columns={'yhat': 'PJME_MW'})\n\nprint(\"Finished training and predicting\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model.plot(forecast)\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's zoom into 2017 onwards and visualise it (with the consistent graph format as above):"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's visually see the results\nplt.scatter(x=train.index, y=train['PJME_MW'], label='Training Data', color='black')\nplt.scatter(x=test.index, y=test['PJME_MW'], label='Test Actuals', color='red')\nplt.plot(PROPHET_prediction['PJME_MW'], label='Prophet', color='orange')\n\n# Plot Confidence Interval\nplt.fill_between(\n    PROPHET_prediction.index,\n    PROPHET_prediction['yhat_lower'],\n    PROPHET_prediction['yhat_upper'],\n    color='skyblue',\n    alpha=0.7, # 70% transparency\n    label='80% CI'\n)\n\n# Plot Labels, Legends etc\nplt.xlabel(\"Timestamp\")\nplt.ylabel(\"MWh\")\nplt.legend(loc='best')\nplt.title('Prophet Model (Daily) - Results')\n\n# For clarify, let's limit to only 2017 onwards\nplt.xlim(datetime(2017, 1, 1),datetime(2018, 9, 1))\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see the 80% confidence interval (in light blue), indicating the model is confident that 80% of the actual data will land in that predicted range."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Like Holtwinters, let's see the components of the model:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model.plot_components(forecast)\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can easily see seasonality and trends - there's a clear downward trend and seasonality every year (more electricity is used in winter)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's evaluate the residuals and see whether the model is biased in any way.
