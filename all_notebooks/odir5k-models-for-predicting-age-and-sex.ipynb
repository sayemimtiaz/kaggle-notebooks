Using this set of keyphrases, I created a dataset of 6943 images of retinal fundi (out of original 7000), in which each image is provided with information about age, sex and clinical condition.\n\nIn this notebook, I'm going to build models for predicting age, sex and diseases from the images of retinal fundi. I will attempr to replicate the results of [Kim et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61519-9). They built convolutional models based on ResNet-152 architecture and trained them on almost 220,000 images of healthy fundi, to predict age and sex. Afterwards, they tested these models on separate test sets from healthy patients, as well as those from patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension as well as those who were smokers. In general, they obtained very good results training their models on a pretty small learning rate (barely 1e-5) for just 10 epochs: MAE (mean absolute error) of around 3 years for age prediction and AUC (area under the curve) of about 0.97 for sex prediction.\n\nHere we have access to only 3100 images of healthy retinal fundi, so we may not get as good results as Kim et al. did. We also have much less images displaying symptoms of diseases for the task of predicting diseases from images, which was not undertaken by Kim et al. \n\nNevertheless, let's see how it goes.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import everything we need\n\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt, image as mpimg\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom time import time\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport random\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import models, layers, optimizers, losses, metrics, utils, callbacks\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet152\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator as IDG\nfrom skimage.transform import resize\n\nIMG_SIZE = 512\nBATCH_SIZE = 32\n\n\n\n# Set up all the paths and load the data\n\ntrain_dir = '../input/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k/ODIR-5K/Training Images'\ntest_dir = '../input/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k/ODIR-5K/Testing Images'\nmain_dir = '../input/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k/ODIR-5K'\nhistory_dir = '/kaggle/working/history'\nmodels_dir = '/kaggle/working/models'\ntry:\n    os.mkdir(history_dir)\n    os.mkdir(models_dir)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    pass\n\n\ndata = pd.read_excel(os.path.join(main_dir,'data.xlsx'), sheet_name=None)\ndata = pd.DataFrame(data[list(data.keys())[0]])\n\nconditions = list(data.columns[-8:])\n\n\n# copy-pasted from previous notebook's output:\n\ndiagnostic_keyphrases = {'N': ['normal fundus'], \n 'D': ['nonproliferative retinopathy',\n  'non proliferative retinopathy',\n  'proliferative retinopathy'],\n 'G': ['glaucoma'],\n 'C': ['cataract'],\n 'A': ['age-related macular degeneration'],\n 'H': ['hypertensive'],\n 'M': ['myopi'],\n 'O': ['macular epiretinal membrane',\n  'epiretinal membrane',\n  'drusen',\n  'lens dust',\n  'myelinated nerve fibers',\n  'laser spot',\n  'vitreous degeneration',\n  'refractive media opacity',\n  'spotted membranous change',\n  'tessellated fundus',\n  'maculopathy',\n  'chorioretinal atrophy',\n  'branch retinal vein occlusion',\n  'retinal pigmentation',\n  'white vessel',\n  'post retinal laser surgery',\n  'epiretinal membrane over the macula',\n  'retinitis pigmentosa',\n  'central retinal vein occlusion',\n  'optic disc edema',\n  'post laser photocoagulation',\n  'retinochoroidal coloboma',\n  'atrophic change',\n  'optic nerve atrophy',\n  'old branch retinal vein occlusion',\n  'depigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium',\n  'chorioretinal atrophy with pigmentation proliferation',\n  'central retinal artery occlusion',\n  'old chorioretinopathy',\n  'pigment epithelium proliferation',\n  'retina fold',\n  'abnormal pigment ',\n  'idiopathic choroidal neovascularization',\n  'branch retinal artery occlusion',\n  'vessel tortuosity',\n  'pigmentation disorder',\n  'rhegmatogenous retinal detachment',\n  'macular hole',\n  'morning glory syndrome',\n  'atrophy',\n  'low image quality',\n  'arteriosclerosis',\n  'asteroid hyalosis',\n  'congenital choroidal coloboma',\n  'macular coloboma',\n  'optic discitis',\n  'oval yellow-white atrophy',\n  'wedge-shaped change',\n  'wedge white line change',\n  'retinal artery macroaneurysm',\n  'retinal vascular sheathing',\n  'suspected abnormal color of  optic disc',\n  'suspected retinal vascular sheathing',\n  'suspected retinitis pigmentosa',\n  'silicone oil eye']}\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"con2img -
