Every virus has Basic Reproduction number (R0) which implies how many people will get the disease from the infected person. As per inital reseach work R0 of COVID-19 is 2.7.\n\nCurrently the goal of all scientists around the world is to \"Flatten the Curve\". COVID-19 currently has exponential growth rate around the world which we will be seeing in the notebook ahead. Flattening the Curve typically implies even if the number of Confirmed Cases are increasing but the distribution of those cases should be over longer timestamp. To put it in simple words if say suppose COVID-19 is going infect 100K people then those many people should be infected in 1 year but not in a month. \n\nThe sole reason to Flatten the Curve is to reudce the load on the Medical Systems so as to increase the focus of Research to find the Medicine for the disease.\n\nEvery Pandemic has four stages:\n\nStage 1: Confirmed Cases come from other countries\n\nStage 2: Local Transmission Begins\n\nStage 3: Communities impacted with local transimission\n\nStage 4: Significant Transmission with no end in sight\n\nItaly, USA, UK and France are the two countries which are currently in Stage 4\nWhile India is in on the edge of Stage 3.\n\nOther ways to tackle the disease like Corona other than Travel Ban, Cross-Border shutdown, Ban on immigrants are Testing, Contact Tracing and Quarantine.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Interesting YouTube Videos related to COVID-19\nGravitas: Why is the WHO Director General toeing China's line? | Coronavirus: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1NGzmDVWxA\n\nGravitas: Demand grows for W.H.O Boss' resignation:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8TfKok9Rns&t=157s\n\nGravitas: Wuhan Coronavirus, countries that are setting an example for the world:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peBNIHRtUY8&t=298s\n\nGravitas: Wuhan Coronavirus, Is China downplaying the number of victims?:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VEcyEhrtgI\n\nGravitas: UNSC fails to pin responsibility on China | Coronavirus:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op43xZ1XMQY\n\nGravitas: Will China change its eating habits? | Wuhan Coronavirus:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjGw36K0RCU\n\nGravitas: Taiwan unearths China's 'Fake apology' plot | Coronavirus outbreak\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kLYAiv4TkA\n\nLeaders around the world determined to flatten the COVID-19 curve | Coronavirus | World News:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=licXTAyMx3c&list=WL&index=2&t=164s","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Objective of the Notebook","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Objective of this notebook is to study COVID-19 outbreak with the help of some basic visualizations techniques.

Conclusion","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"COVID-19 doesn't have very high mortatlity rate as we can see which is the most positive take away. Also the healthy Recovery Rate implies the disease is cureable. The only matter of concern is the exponential growth rate of infection. \n\nCountries like USA, Spain, United Kingdom,and Italy are facing some serious trouble in containing the disease showing how deadly the neglegence can lead to. The need of the hour is to perform COVID-19 pendemic controlling practices like Testing, Contact Tracing and Quarantine with a speed greater than the speed of disease spread at each country level.\n\n![CO2%20Footprint.jpg](attachment:CO2%20Footprint.jpg)\n\nThe reason of putting this graph in the conclusion, there is an interesting pattern to observe here, Everytime there has been drop in World's Carbon emission, the world economy crashed. A one classic example is 2008 recession. I think most of you must have already guessed what's ahead, probably COVID-19 is just a big wave with a Tsunami of Recession or Depression following it. \n\nThe growth of Confirmed and Death Cases seems to have slowed down since past few days. Which is really good sign. Hope this goes like that for a brief period. There should not be any new country emerging as the new epicenter of COVID-19 just like USA happened to be that epicenter for brief period. In case if any new country emerges as new epicenter, the Growth of Confirmed Cases will shoot up again.\n\n### Will be updating the notebook with new Data Visualization Plot and new Prediction and Forecasting Models.

Also, any kind of suggestion and corrections would be highly appreciated!\n\n## Stay Safe and follow basic hygiene
