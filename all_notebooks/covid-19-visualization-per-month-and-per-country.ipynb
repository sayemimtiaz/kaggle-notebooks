It is a contagious disease which spread very fast, so that more than 20 million cases were confirmed, causing more than 800,000 deaths at the end of August.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nI am a student and i first got interested by data science early this year. I decided to learn it so i watched videos and i went on specialized websites but i figured out the best way to learn it was to make my own project. This is when the idea of a second lockdown due to the covid-19 came on the news in France. This reminded me that there is a lot of data on this disease, and i also wanted to check the pure data to see if this was a good idea.\n\nIn this kernel, we will first see the global situation of the virus, then we'll see which countries have the most number of cases and finally we will conclude on the relevance of a second lockdown in France. It's a short kernel.\n\n**PS :** The following study do not take into account the values after the 08/31/2020 for the study 'per month' and 'per country'. The dataset is updated each day.\n\nAs a beginner, I hope this kernel can help other beginners on the use of Seaborn as well as Dataframe Manipulation. I tried to comment my code.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport seaborn as sns \nimport random\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\nimport os, glob\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename)) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#We first import the data (copy-paste of the input files' paths)\ndf_data =pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/covid_19_data.csv\")\ndf_ts_confirmed = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_confirmed.csv\")\ndf_ts_recovered = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_recovered.csv\")\ndf_ts_confirmed_us = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_confirmed_US.csv\")\ndf_ts_deaths = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_deaths.csv\")\ndf_ts_death_us = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_deaths_US.csv\")\ndf_ll = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/COVID19_line_list_data.csv\")\ndf_oll = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/COVID19_open_line_list.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Global Study**\n\n1.

can think that the idea of a second lockdown is a bit exagirated because the rise of confirmed cases in August may be caused by a rise of tests.\n\nSo i searched a litlle bit of info on this matter especially on this website : https://www.cascoronavirus.fr/test-depistage/france\n\nWe see that around 4% of the tests are positive in late August whereas only 1-2% of them was positive in June-July.
