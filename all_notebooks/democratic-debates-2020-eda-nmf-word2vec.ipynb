of the Democratic debates 2020:\n\n1. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren gave more speeches that every other congressmen/congresswomen\n2. All the candidates spoke for an average duration of 17 seconds.\n3. The most common topics of discussion were: \n                         (1) Wealth and tax returns of the candidates\n                         (2) Healthcare provisions for the community\n                         (3) Follow-up, opening, closing, and rebuttals \n                         (4) Changes in policies, and the associated dilemmas\n                         (5) Judiciary, and law\n                         (6) Deportation issues, and the economic impacts\n                         (7) Impeachment of the President\n                         (8) Climate change\n                         (9) Various classes in the society (higher, lower, and middle) and respective issues\n                         (10) Gun laws, and racism\n                         \nThe analysis of the democratic debates show that the debates generally center around the wealth status of the candidates and the respective follow-ups/rebuttals/rivalries. The second most prioritized topic is \"Healthcare\", which is a prime concern for people of all demographics. The ethical dilemmas within the conducts of the American society are less discussed, due to possible lobbying efforts and differing points of view (when the party members know certain topics are too controversial, they tend to not mention it voluntarily in their speeches, but it seems they are asked questions regarding those topics by other members/audience)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sentiment clarification with Word2Vec Embedding"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import string\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\ndemocrat_speeches = list()\nlines = data[\"speech\"].tolist()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    tokens = word_tokenize(line)\n    # lowercase\n    tokens = [word.lower() for word in tokens]\n    # remove punctuation\n    table = str.maketrans(\"\",\"\", string.punctuation)\n    strip = [w.translate(table) for w in tokens]\n    # remove remaining non-alphabets\n    words = [word for word in strip if word.isalpha()]\n    # filter stop-words\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    words = [w for w in words if not w in stop_words]\n    democrat_speeches.append(words)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import gensim\n\n# Train word2vec model\nmodel = gensim.models.Word2Vec(sentences = democrat_speeches, size = 100, window = 5, workers = 4, min_count = 1)\n# Vocab size\nwords = list(model.wv.vocab)\nprint(\"Vocabulary size: \", len(words))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #1: Tax\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"tax\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #2: Healthcare\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"healthcare\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #3: Rebuttals\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"rebuttal\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #4: Policy\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"policy\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #5: Law\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"law\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #6: Immigration\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"immigration\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #7: Impeachment\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"impeachment\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #8: Climate\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"climate\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #9: Class\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"class\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Talked issue #10: Racism\")\nmodel.wv.most_similar(\"racism\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
