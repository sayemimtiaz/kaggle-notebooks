[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a framework that allows for map-reduce workloads with a SQL-interface through the `pyspark.sql` module. The data provided by CORD-19 is semi-structured and contains many nested fields that can be tricky to work with. \n\nThis notebook contains starter code for pre-processing the raw JSON documents into a structured and strongly-typed [Spark DataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) that can be queried using Spark SQL. I'll provide a cell that can be used as the starting point for exploration into the dataset. I'll also provide a few example queries for interacting with nested data.\n\n\n### Handy References\n\n* [`spark.sql` module documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html)\n* [Databricks `select` documentation on lateral view](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/language-manual/select.html#lateral-view)\n* [Spark Data Types reference](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-reference.html)\n\n\n### Notes on the environment\n\nTo being, make sure the notebook has access to the internet. If you are running any Spark code locally, I suggest setting the `SPARK_HOME` variable so it is pointing to the local python site packages.\n\n```bash\n# in bash or zsh on MacOS or Linux\nSPARK_HOME=$(python -c \"import pyspark; print(pyspark.__path__[0])\")\n\n# in powershell on Windows\n$env:SPARK_HOME = $(python -c \"import pyspark; print(pyspark.__path__[0])\")\n```"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Starter Code\n\nSpark can be installed via the Python package manager, `pip`."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"! pip install pyspark","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from pyspark.sql.functions import lit\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import (\n    ArrayType,\n    IntegerType,\n    MapType,\n    StringType,\n    StructField,\n    StructType,\n)\n\n\ndef generate_cord19_schema():\n    \"\"\"Generate a Spark schema based on the semi-textual description of CORD-19 Dataset.\n\n    This captures most of the structure from the crawled documents, and has been\n    tested with the 2020-03-13 dump provided by the CORD-19 Kaggle competition.\n    The schema is available at [1], and is also provided in a copy of the\n    challenge dataset.\n\n    One improvement that could be made to the original schema is to write it as\n    JSON schema, which could be used to validate the structure of the dumps.
