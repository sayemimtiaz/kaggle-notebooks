When the mainstream press covers the game, it is Summoner's Rift that they refer to. On this map, two teams of five players compete to destroy an enemy structure called a Nexus, which is guarded by the enemy team and a number of defensive structures called turrets, or towers. Each team aims to defend its own structures and destroy the other team's structures. There are six turrets on each lane, three per team, and destroying one generates gold for the team that does so. Two additional turrets protect each team's nexus.\n\n![Summoner's Rift](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Map_of_MOBA.svg/240px-Map_of_MOBA.svg.png)\n\nEach nexus is located in each enemy base on opposite sides of the map, in the lower-left and upper-right hand corners. Minions are generated in waves from each team's nexus, which advance toward the enemy base along three paths: top, middle, and bottom lanes. Players compete to advance these waves of minions into the enemy base, which allows them to destroy enemy structures and ultimately win the match. Summoner's Rift matches typically last between 30–40 minutes if played until nexus destruction, but an early surrender functionality is available in the game.\n\n**Essential Game Elements**\n\n* Champions: are the player-controlled character in League of Legends icon League of Legends. Each champion possesses unique abilities and attributes.\n* Minions: are units that comprise the main force sent by the Nexus. They spawn periodically from their nexus and advance along a lane towards the enemy nexus, automatically engaging any enemy unit or structure they encounter. They are controlled by artificial intelligence, and only use basic attacks.\n* Monsters: are neutral units in League of Legends. Unlike minions, monsters do not fight for either team, but when killed, can give a team an advantage over the other.\n* A ward: is a deployable unit that removes the fog of war over the surrounding area.\n* Turrets: also called towers, are heavy fortifications that attack enemy units on sight. Turrets are a core component of League of Legends. They deal damage to enemies and provide vision to their team, allowing them to better control the battlefield.\n* Gold: is the in-game currency of League of Legends. It is used to buy items in the shop that provide champions with bonus stats and abilities, which in turn is one of the main ways for champions to increase their power over the course of a game.\n* Champion experience (XP): is a game mechanic that allows champions to level up after reaching certain amounts of experience. Leveling up allows them access to new abilities or higher ranks of existing abilities.\n\n# This Dataset\n\nThis dataset contains the first 10min. stats of approx. 10k ranked games (SOLO QUEUE) from a high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER). Players have roughly the same level, our goal is to do some analysis on the importance of each element in winning a game, and also develop a model that predicts which team will win."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing Libraries\nIn this section we import different libraries for Analysis, Visualization, Modeling and Evaluation"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #

In general, decision trees are constructed via an algorithmic approach that identifies ways to split a data set based on different conditions. It is one of the most widely used and practical methods for supervised learning. Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/he-public-data/Fig%201-18e1a01b.png)\n\nThe decision rules are generally in form of if-then-else statements. The deeper the tree, the more complex the rules and fitter the model, but it can also, if it goes very deep, overfit the data.\n\nThe basic algorithm used in decision trees is known as the ID3 (by Quinlan) algorithm. The ID3 algorithm builds decision trees using a top-down, greedy approach. Briefly, the steps to the algorithm are:\n- Select the best attribute → A \n- Assign A as the decision attribute (test case) for the NODE. \n- For each value of A, create a new descendant of the NODE.\n- Sort the training examples to the appropriate descendant node leaf.\n- If examples are perfectly classified, then STOP else iterate over the new leaf nodes.\n\nThe importance of features is calculated using Gini Impurity or Entropy:\n\n**The Entropy** or information gain is calculated by this formula:\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/442/1*efLrD1ECWl-utII0KYb7tQ.jpeg)\n\n**The Gini Impurity** is calculated by this formula:\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/442/1*vRlwRFknvfgWLBed1vsGoQ.jpeg)\nWhere p is the probability of the class in a given feature\n\n**For this problem** We're going to use the gini score as it is calculated with less computational cost."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def test_classifier(classifier, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):\n    \n    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)\n    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n    \n    return f'{round(accuracy,2)*100}%', cm","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Model Performance\nWe've chosen a decision tree classifier with max depth of 3, because more depth will lead to overfitting and definitely worse performance on the test set\nThe model has performed 72% accuracy on the test set, we've also plotted a confusion matrix that shows both the number of correctly classified and the missclassified examples in terms of (True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives and False Negatives).
