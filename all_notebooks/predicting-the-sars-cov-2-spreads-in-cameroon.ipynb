But after **April 7, 2020** it starts to be like a staircase curve. What can be behind this behavior? Are there one or more parameters that can explain this? we will be following this notebook.\n\nIn the meantime, because of the socio-economic situation of this country imposed by Covid19, the government of Cameroon was forced to relax the measures to combat Covid19 on April 30, 2020: we will mention the most important that can promote the surge of the pandemic in Cameroon; We have:\n\n- Opening after 6 p.m., drinking places, restaurants and places of leisure, with the obligation for customers and users to respect barrier measures, in particular the wearing of protective masks and social distancing.\n- lifting of the measure reducing the regulatory number of passengers in all public transport by bus and taxis. Wearing a mask is compulsory and overloading is prohibited.\n\n**source: https://www.bbc.com/afrique/52496808**\n\nWhat worries me with these two measures from the current 19 measures, is the fact that Cameroonians do not know individual responsibility for respecting the barrier measures against SARS Cov 2. The government's decision could bring an exponential growth of the disease . Bars, restaurants, public transport, etc. are places with high risk and high transmission of the disease.

If we are interested in finding to what extent there is a numerical relationship between two variables of interest, using their correlation coefficient will give misleading results if there is another, confounding, variable that is numerically related to both variables of interest. This misleading information can be avoided by controlling for the confounding variable, which is done by computing the partial correlation coefficient. This is precisely the motivation for including other right-side variables in a multiple regression; but while multiple regression gives unbiased results for the effect size, it does not give a numerical value of a measure of the strength of the relationship between the two variables of interest.\n\nFor example, if we have economic data on the consumption, income, and wealth of various individuals and we wish to see if there is a relationship between consumption and income, failing to control for wealth when computing a correlation coefficient between consumption and income would give a misleading result, since income might be numerically related to wealth which in turn might be numerically related to consumption; a measured correlation between consumption and income might actually be contaminated by these other correlations.
