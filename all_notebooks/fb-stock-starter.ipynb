This method consists of dividing the dataset into several time frames.

By applying this method, the model is based on more recent data.\n\nThe final model and parameters shown below are the ones that provided the best accuracy considering the average accuracy from all windows.

The inherent capability of SVM to avoid overfitting contributed to this conclusion. During experimental testing, random forest  showed a high tendency to overfit to training data achieving contradictory results between training and test accuracy. Essential contributions from literature allowed the construction of a model that can forecast with similar accuracies of current published papers. As it is the case for market traders, the usage of technical indicators and global indexes have shown to be a powerful strategy to support forecast decisions.
