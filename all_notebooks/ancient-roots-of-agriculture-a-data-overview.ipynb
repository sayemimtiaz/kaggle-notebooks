Food is an essential thing for every living being, and this makes argiculture more about survial than trade. Before known history and beyond, humans practised agricultural techniques and practices. This was corroborated with the archaeological evidence throughout world. \n\nAs per wikipedia,The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least eleven separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Recent evidences suggests agriculture in rome, chile, chain, mexico, native american tribes, russia, india, yemen and few several other places. Time period of agriculture dates back to 10000Bc, which is far beyond our documented history of human kind. \n\nSince 10000BC, several civilizations existed and practised various kind of techinques,and implementations in field of agriculture, and surpricingly few of those techniques and practises are carried over to current time period. For instance, Irrigation system, nearly few 1000 years ago, tribe in chile, used cetral irrigation system. With time, few things advanced,and few things disappered from existance. Interestingly, recent technological advances, and historical innovations, scientists and archaeologists are exploring ruins of old world throughout world, and bringing forgotten knowledge into light for future benifits. On such coloborative effort is this <strong>Seshat Project</strong>. They are collective of researcheres and students throughout world, and unravelling the mysteries of world in argiculture, millitary, Finances, and adminstrations roles. This seshat project on agriculture, mainly conducted through out world at specific regions called <strong>Natural Geographic Areas</strong> where they coded knowledge into a standard form. This data is not machine readable, and all the instructions to decode these things are available with seshat coded manual. \n\nThis dataset is prepared as part of <strong>Agriculture Seshat research</strong> with a objective to put findings to good use in current time. Thing that interest in this data is this dataset is <strong>Non-machine readable</strong>, needed ground work and manual conversions to understand ancient roots of agriculture.\n\n<strong>If Interested to know about data, here is official information about Agricultural Productivity and Carrying Capacity </strong>\n\n<div class = 'image'> <img style=\"float:center; width:50% ; border:5px solid #007580\" align=center src = https://github.com/bhuvan454/TheSparkFoundation_Internship/blob/main/ag2.png?raw=true> \n</div>\n\n\n<a href =\"http://seshatdatabank.info/early_agriculture/\" title = \"Ancient Agriculture Mural Diorama\" style = \"font-size:20px,color: dimgrey, text-align:left,font-family:serif\">Image Source: Early Agriculture </a>\n\n<br>\nAbove picture is from seshat project and their conclusions of farming origins.\nAgricultural productivity and its variation across time and space plays a fundamental role in many theories of human social and cultural evolution. Because agricultural societies enjoy a demographic advantage over hunter-gatherer societies, the transition from foraging to agriculture fueled a series of population expansions world-wide, which spread the farmers’ culture, language, and genes with them. However, although the Neolithic Revolution was one of the most consequential transitions in human evolution, we lack systematically collected quantitative estimates of the productivity of past agricultural systems on a large enough scale.\n\nIn particular, by how much did adoption of agriculture increase human carrying capacity, the maximum population density a particular environment can sustain indefinitely, without depleting critical resources needed for survival and reproduction? Even more importantly, how did agricultural productivity carrying capacity vary over time (as new technologies were invented and spread, and as a result of climate change) and in space (between geographic regions characterized by different soils, landscapes, and climate)\n\nSeshat: Global History Databank is exploring various techniques to combine estimations of historical ecology, corp types and yields, and farming practices along with simulations of changing weather patterns to produce reliable, empirically-grounded estimates of productivity and carrying capacity in different parts of the world through time.\n\n<br>\n<strong>Let's dive into the data...</strong>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = '1.1'></a>\n<h2 style = \"font-size:30px; font-family:Garamond ; font-weight : normal; background-color: #007580; color :#fed049   ; text-align: center; border-radius: 5px 5px; padding: 5px\"> 1.1 Initial Glimpse on Data </h2> ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, lets import all the required libraries to handle data, analysis and visualization process.
