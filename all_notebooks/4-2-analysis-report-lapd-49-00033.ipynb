It explains the process and flow of automation, standardization, processing, and analysis of data. In the *second kernel*, the first component of the solution pipeline : data integration and processing is implemented. It processes both core level data as well as department level data. In the *third kernel*, this pipeline is executed and run for several departments. After all the standardized and clean data is produced, it is analysed with different formats of the Analysis Framework in 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 kernels. In *kernel 4.1*, core analysis is done along with link with crime rate and poverty data. In *kernel 4.2*, core analysis is done along with statistical analysis. In *kernel 4.3*, officer level analysis is done. \n\n<hr>\n\nThis kernel, is the fourth of the series. In this kernel, Analysis report for Los Angeles Department is shared.

Black's was the other most arrested race followed by Whites with on an average (28% for blacks and 18% for whites)  \n> - About half of the police arrests were made on Hispanics, but interesting to note that their population porportion is not very far away, it is about 44%. About 30% of the police incidents are targeted on Blacks (population : 8%) while 20% incidents are targeted on Whites (population : 47%)  \n> - Though the aggregted black's population is only 9% in all the districts, but the different arrests by police is on-an-average about 30% on blacks on average.  \n> - There are a couple of districts in which Hispanic population is stopped more often than any other population. For example, in district 2, 4, 10, 11, 13, and 20, A much higher hispanic population is the target of vehicle stops.  \n\n\n\n<a id=\"2\"></a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2. Deep Exploration of Police Activity : Police Arrests <hr></font>\n\nAll the analysis is first done at high level and then by controlling the socio-econometric or demographic factors of the area which the department serves. The main idea of this analysis is to measure following points : \n\n- Are there racial disparities in policy activities ?   \n- To what extent the racial disparities exist in the department ?  \n- What are the key factors that can explain racial disparities ?  \n\nAs the first step, we set the department and load the processed datasets that were produced from the data processing and analysis pipeline. Additionally, for the analysis of this department, we also used external dataset about vehicle stops, so we will also load that. For every department, we have stored the processed data which was the result of component A of the pipeline. Let's look at the glimpse of the two main datasets that will be used to analyse the racial bias in this department.\n\n- Enriched DF : The dataframe containing estimated demographics information  \n- Police DF : The dataframe containing the police incidents aggregated by demographics variables  "},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"_dept = \"Dept_49-00033\"\nenriched_df, police_df, shape_gdf, _base_dir, events_df = _get_dfs(_dept)\n\n############# Also load the external dataset used #######################\nvstops_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/external-datasets-cpe/la_stops/vehicle-and-pedestrian-stop-data-2010-to-present.csv\", low_memory=False)\nvstops_df[\"Stop Date\"] = pd.to_datetime(vstops_df[\"Stop Date\"])\nvstops_df[\"Year\"] = vstops_df[\"Stop Date\"].dt.year\nvstops_df[\"month\"] = vstops_df[\"Stop Date\"].dt.month\nvstops = vstops_df[(vstops_df['Year'] == 2015) & (vstops_df['Stop Type'] == \"VEH\")]\n\nenriched_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2fc9362cf0e518640937e329e585bc2edeac9de6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"police_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e31ed4011636a2e9ba312b50b127514cd9d9af91"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2.1\"></a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.1 Overview : Police Arrests <hr></font>\n\nFirst, let's look at an overall high level summary of the police activity : Arrests in the different districts covered by this department.

The idea is to understand what are the **most significant variables** important for estimating the vehicle stops by police in an area (after controlling the socio-econometric factors.)  \n> - From the model summary, we can observe that there are two significant variables : **blacks_income** and **whites_to_blacks_ratio**. These variables has low p-value (less than 0.05).  \n> - The coefficients of both these variables has **negative sign** which indicates that ares where blacks income is increased, vehicle stops will tend to decrease. Similarly, areas in which ratio of whites to black population is increased, number of vehicle stops tend to decrease.  \n> - These effects explains that there exists racial bias in police activity (vehicle stops) as the occurance is somewhat affacted by demographics of the popoulation of an area. \n\n### <font color=\"#703bdb\">End Notes</font>\n\nIn this report, we saw that racial bias exists in the department's police activity and there is a need to rework on the policies used by police.
