CatBoost is fast and robust, with sensible defaults out-the-box; but wouldn't it be great if CatBoost was differentiable. Work on tree-like neural networks has a [long body of literature](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~oirsoy/softtree.html). And many important authors have put their names to research looking to apply there methods to model [distillation and explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09784). What makes CatBoost special is its use of [Oblivious Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o0e-r0B5xQ). Unlike other tree method that consider every leaf at every depth, Oblivious trees ensure a feature is reused across all trees of a certain depth.  In [Neural Oblivious Decision Ensemble (NODE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06312) authors borrow attention breakthroughs from [EntMax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00015.pdf), to make soft oblivious decision trees more closely resemble our traditional greedy learners. By imagining trees as a set of attention mechanisms and allowing differentiable compute, these models steal performance from embeddings, shared feature representation and advances in pre-training, to achieve promising results on tabular data problems. \n\n![node](https://github.com/Qwicen/node/raw/master/images/densetree.png)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# NODE\nUnlike in my previous work on TabNet, NODE authors provide a high quality and elegent [pytorch implementation](https://github.com/Qwicen/node) for use by the open-source community.

These thresholds are learned and made sparse with the sparsemax activation function. One difficulty in implementing Neural Oblivious Trees is in initializing the thresholds so that data is balanced across the splits when training starts. This involves sampling from the Beta distribution and finding a corresponding percentile. \n\nOne major advantage of NODE is that leafs effectively serve as embedding layers, allowing leaves to easily learn multiclass classification problems. To ensemble models, authors recommend using summing across trees at a particular layer and using that vector as input to later tree ensembles. This is an interesting proposition of this approach which sets it apart from out traditional ensembles.
