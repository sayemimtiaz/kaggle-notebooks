Many popular songs are energetic, though not necessarily dance songs. Because the correlation here is not too high, low energy songs do have some potential to be more popular.\n\n3) Acousticness seems to be uncorrelated with popularity. Most popular songs today have either electronic or electric instruments in them. It is very rare that a piece of music played by a chamber orchestra or purely acoustic band becomes immesely popular (though, again, not impossible).\n\nOther things worth noting:\n\n1) Loudness and energy are highly correlated. This makes some sense as energy is definately influence by the volume the music is being played at.\n\n2) Acousticness is highly negatively correlated with energy, loudness, and year.\n\n3) Valence and dancability are highly coorelated.

The objective was to predict the popularity of any song and build a recommendation system to recommend songs\n2. Performed Exploratory data analysis to derive insights from the data\n3. Mostly 2000 popular songs are identified and added every year in Spotify\n4. The most popular Artist from 1921 to 2020 is the Beatles\n5. The most popular song is Dakiti by Bad Bunny & Jhay Cortez’s released on 30th October 2020\n6. The data was split into — train (80%) and test datasets (20%) for model building and evaluation respectively\n7. Using GridSearchCV we could find the optimal hyperparameters for the decision tree Regressor model and achieved an accuracy of 76.6%"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"My Blog is published on Medium Platform\n\nhttps://medium.com/swlh/spotify-song-prediction-and-recommendation-system-b3bbc71398ad\n    "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
