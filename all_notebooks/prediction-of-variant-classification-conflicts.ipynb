I'm relatively new to data science, so I welcome any constructive feedback you'd like to offer. This is an updated version of the kernel, after I did some debugging of some errors in use of PCA.\n# Feature Selection and Engineering\n\n\nFirst I'd like to examine the most promising columns of the data set to determine which features would most likely be relevant to prediction of conflicts, and convert them to workable formats.\n\nThe reference point I'll be using to ascertain the \"relevant\" features is to check the base rate of conflict: the prior probability of any variant having a conflicting classification is 25.21%. Comparing this rate to the rate of conflict among samples with a given value for a binary feature - which, as we'll see, are the predominant useable features in this dataset - should help illuminate which features will have predictive power. This isn't perfect, since of course some patterns may arise only among subsets of samples filtered by *multiple* features,  but if we retain enough features for our training set, such interactions will likely be revealed in the machine learning models themselves.\n\nOne very important lesson I learned far too late - if you're going to use cross-validation, split your data into the k folds *before* you select your features! This has been detailed before in sources such as [this one](https://github.com/mottalrd/cross-validation-done-wrong/blob/master/Cross%20Validation%20done%20wrong.ipynb), but it's actually an embarrassingly simple concept. If you choose your features based on their correlations with the classification variable in the entire dataset, or the distribution of that classification variable among samples of a given feature value in the entire dataset, then you're including information that will bias your model when you evaluate its performance on different folds of the training set! This consideration led me to exclude certain chromosome dummy variables whose conflict rate estimates became less significant when I corrected this potential source of bias."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"94ad33b053512c04873dfef24e1a081b6ef9c6cd"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore') # A warning about F1 score appears every time recall for one\n                                  # class is 0; it's unnecessary to keep seeing this.\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/clinvar_conflicting.csv', dtype={0: object, 38: str, 40: object})\nprint(df['CLASS'].describe())\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c2213b491739b07057b2409c632c2586473d5961"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"(Credit to Kevin Arvai's EDA Kernel.)
