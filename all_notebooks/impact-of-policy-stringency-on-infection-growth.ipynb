Overview\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic reaches 188 countries and territories, causing more than 4.89 million cases and more than 322,000 deaths as of May 19, 2020, governments worldwide have responded with a wide range of measures. The measures adopted by each country vary by intensity and timing, and they have contributed to the differing degrees of national effectiveness to contain the virus.\n\nIn this submission we evaluate the impact of government strategies on Covid-19 infection by developing a typology of governments' early policy responses and comparing infection rates across the categories. Government responses often involve various combinations of policies, ranging from public health to economics. To compare policies across countries, we adopt the Oxford Covid-19 government response stringency index, a common index that aggregates policy scores and is comparable across countries. Furthermore, we focus on **early government actions**, that is, measures imposed during the span of two weeks before the date of the first confirmed case in a country and one month afterwards.\n\n\n### Takeaways\n\nWe derived five categories of early national responses from cluster analysis (more details in section 3.1):\n\n* Proactive\n* Swiftly Responsive\n* Responsive\n* Moderately Responsive\n* Slow Start\n\nWe then compared across the country categories the infection curves and the speed at which the infection reached certain thresholds. We controlled for country healthcare and economic differences using match and regression analysis.\n\nWe find that countries with Proactive or Responsive Covid-19 response profiles tend to experience slower infection at a smaller scale. The difference between the two groups is indistinguishable. On the other hand, countries in the Slow Start group had the fastest growth of confirmed cases, while the Moderately Responsive group lies in-between. Due to the small sample size (74 countries), only the difference between the Proactive group and the Slow Start group is statistically significant.\n\nSimilar policies seem to be less effective on countries deprived of resources. Covid19 may bring countries with pre-existing social and economic vulnerabilities an even greater degree of uncertainty. These countries require focus study with analytical models different from other countries to help better predict the influence of policies.\n\n### Caveats ### \n\nAs expected, more proactive and quicker government responses are beneficial in the fight of the Covid-19 virus. However, our analysis also yielded some counterintuitive findings, such as placing Germany in the Slow Start group along with the United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain. This misalignment suggests that the policy metric we adopted, the Oxford stringency index, may not accurately or holistically capture government responses to the pandemic, and that government policy alone may not determine the outcome of the country in the pandemic. Last but not least, as we evaluate government responses, we should keep in mind the economic and social impacts of these policies, in particular the lockdown measures, in addition to their health impacts.\n\n## 2. Data\nOne of the datasets we use in this submission comes from the UNCOVER datasets, the UNCOVER John Hopkins CSSE global confirmed cases. We accessed the data on the project's github page on May 9th (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).\n\nThe core of our analysis is built upon the time series of the Oxford Covid-19 government response stringency index. We accessed the data on May 9th at https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/\n\nWe also include a number of country-level socioeconomic variables:\n\n* UN population-related data (https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/)\n* World Bank GDP data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?view=map)\n* Kaggle country to continent (https://www.kaggle.com/statchaitya/country-to-continent)\n* World Bank life expectancy at birth by country (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.le00.in)\n\nWe have uploaded both raw and processed datasets used in this submission. In the visualization and analysis section below, we directly imported the cleaned data. In the Appendix at the end of this notebook, we demonstrated step-by-step how we cleaned up the raw data.\n\nOur final sample consists of 74 countries. Our sample choice is highly constrained by data availability. We adopt a six-week period to summarize and classify government responses. The six-week period starts from 15 days before the diagnosis of the first case to 30 days after the first confirmed case. Countries with significant missing data during this period were dropped. We also exclude from our sample countries with fewer than 1,000 cumulative confirmed cases.\n\n## 3.

With the week in which the first Covid-19 case was confirmed labelled as week 0, we show in this figure the distribution of government responses from five weeks before week 0 to 8 weeks after week 0.\n\nThis heatmap shows that countries are overwhelmingly concentrated in the bottom left corner and the top right corner. The concentration at the bottom left indicates that most countries did not take any action and have a stringency score betwen 0 and 10 in the weeks before week0. The concentration on the top right has lighter colors than the bottom left corner does. This illustrates that many countries have reached the highest level of policy stringency (scores between 90 and 100) during weeks 5-8, but there are also some countries located in the lower intervals. \n\nBased on this heatmap, we choose the period from two weeks before week 0 to 4 weeks after week 0 as the observation period of early government responses. This observation period captures large variations in governments' early policy stringency and faciliates the classification of countries through cluster analysis.
