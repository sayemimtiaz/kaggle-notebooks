the models we select the 7th model that is linear regression using SGD to predict the total load consumption because \nit has got the best Adjusted R-squared value and least RMSE value.\n\nAs we know that Adjusted R-squared gives us information about the best features added and RMSE gives us information about \nthe least difference between actual and predicted value.Since RMSE value for linear regression with SGD is minimum so we select\nthis model to predict the power consumption.\n\nEven from the statistical summary if we see the AIC,BIC and log-likelihood values, then we can observe that the AIC and BIC values\nof linear regression with SGD is minimum.AIC and BIC is the penalty that is given to the model for losing information during model\nbuilding.So, as the values of AIC and BIC is minimum for the model we select this model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Time Series Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#copying the dataframe in another
