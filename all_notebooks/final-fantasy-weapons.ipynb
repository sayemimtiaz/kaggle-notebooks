There are some significant limitations of the system, though:\n* The dataset used only considers weapons that are higher than level 250 instead of utilising the entire weapons database.\n* The data doesn't include the number of materia which a weapon can hold (think of materia slots as attachment slots), so some weapons could be rated as overpowered by this system but have no materia slots, which would limit the weapon significantly.\n* LDS accounts for the higher damage of high-level weapons by dividing damage by level. However, the totalBonus indicator isn't held back by a weapon's level, so high-level weapons are inherently more likely to be considered overpowered by this system.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Overpowered Arms\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\noverpowered_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-20T14:38:38.211386Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-20T14:38:38.211764Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-20T14:38:38.655676Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-20T14:38:38.211728Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-20T14:38:38.654517Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Underpowered Arms","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"underpowered_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-20T14:39:53.613415Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-20T14:39:53.613782Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-20T14:39:54.038699Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-20T14:39:53.613753Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-20T14:39:54.037508Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Balanced Arms","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"balanced_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-20T14:40:29.645822Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-20T14:40:29.646213Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-20T14:40:31.532896Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-20T14:40:29.646182Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-20T14:40:31.531485Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Web Scraper ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"'''\n# example page: https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/?category2=1&page=2&min_item_lv=250\n# robots.txt: No robots.txt file -
