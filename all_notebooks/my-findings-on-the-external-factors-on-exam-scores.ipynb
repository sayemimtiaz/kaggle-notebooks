Even if it did, you can't change your RGB tones in order to improve your odds at exam. I guess I just found one of those examples of Correlation does not equal causation. \n\nIt's about how you see the math. It's a question if you see it as a question, and can be one major problem if you see it as a problem. Also, have a standard breakfast/lunch, and just take the preparatory courses.

Much like reading, anyone can be taught to write, and with practice comprehend read text and reproduce them back as meaningful answers or ideas.\n\nParents with Master's degree, although a small population, have kids that fare better at writing than the parents holding other degrees. Except for parents with high school degrees, there's a good amount of girls that are exceptional writers as opposed to their male counterparts.\n\nWhy do kids with Parents holding master's degree score better at reading and writing as opposed to parents holding other degrees?\nIs there any difference in literature that the kids are exposed to, based on parental level of education?\n\n**My thoughts:** Is it possible that there's some sort of socio-economic status held by parents holding higher degrees, that lead them to blend with more of their kind (something like a pack) that improves reading/writing abilities for their kids?

But preparation alone isn't enough. You'd have to ensure your brain stays healthy and part of that can be achieved by having a good meal, proper rest\n\n**My thoughts after compiling this**\n\nIf you've come this far, I'd like to thank you for spending the time on what I can only consider as a guy going off the rails on a dataset. It only took me like two long weeks, several hours, and lots of mistakes. There's room for me to improve, but considering this is my first data analysis on a notebook, I'm quite happy with the results\n\nI'm no stranger to writing code. But when it comes to consulting, it becomes more important to getting the idea or the story across than it is preparing it. Most of my hours when preparing reports, are spent trying to find the right type of visualization to show why something is the way it is (and this is using Excel and no little to no programming whatsoever). \n\nIt gets even more complicated if you're the one preparing you're not the one that's presenting it. Sure, there's subjects and degrees that teach you when to use what visualization, but how do you convey that to someone who's gotten rusty at it or hasn't taken the same subjects as you have? Do you spend time explaining the backstory? or Do you end up redesigning what was a good visualization, by trying to dumb it down, only to end up convoluting it further?\n\nAnyway, having worked extensively with Excel and it's visualizations, it's nice to know that this is just as flexible as Excel and the likes. I might be more comfortable with Excel since most of my data is moderately sized or is in one large table, but it's nice to know that if data gets out of control, I can rely on some well written variables and operations to get things done.\n\nHow quickly will I start off with the next notebook? Probably not in the next few minutes (at least). I'm still intimidated with super large datasets, not because they're large in size, but because they're probably more complex than I had imagined or not within my knowledge boundaries. To quote Timothy Ferriss in his book \"The 4-Hour Workweek\"\n>\"Being able to quit things that don't work is integral to being a winner. Going into a project or job without defining when worthwhile becomes wasteful is like going into a casino without a cap on what you will gamble: dangerous and foolish.\"\n\nTips on the notebook, analyses, codes, comments or criticism, or just thoughts in general?
