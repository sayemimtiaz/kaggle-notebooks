The goal in this phase is to understand patterns within our dataset by visualizing and testing to examine relationships in the data. \n- **Model** - This step encompases the higher level pre-processing such as normalization and synthetic oversampling of the minority class. After that we're ready to train some models to be able to give us some accurate predictive power to make intelligent business decisions. There are multiple steps of evaluation and refining of the models to ensure they're as accurate and unbiased as possible. \n- **Interpret** - In the final step, we examine our findings developed by our modeling and indentify important insights.

Other than black holes, pulsars are the most dense objects in the known universe. Pulsars rotate with a very short and precise period which vary from star to star, however due to Radio Frequency Interference and background radiation noise, there are many false-positives when attempting to detect pulsars.  \nFor further reading on pulsars visit the Wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar). \n\n#### Overall Goal:  \nThe goal is to train a machine learning model to classify pulsar candidate stars as either a true pulsar, or a false positive. \nThe overall goal is model accuracy, as computational cost is not of concern in this application.  \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Business Value  \n### Why is this important?\n#### Labor\nIn the most basic way, the ability to effectively train a machine learning algorithm to accurately classify a pulsar from a false positive would free up human assets to be able to complete other tasks. Astronomers are highly educated, and therefore, generally well paid. Freeing up these monetary assets allows them to be productive elsewhere.  \n#### Cutting edge scientific discovery\nPulsars prove to be very helpful for physicists and astronomers for a variety of other reasons. Being able to quickly and effectively identify pulsars would allow more of them to be discovered and used for other types of experiments.  \nResearch on Pulsars has already yeilded two Nobel Peace Prizes. Pulsar research is at the tip of the spear in humanity's quest to understand gravitational waves and relativistic physics.  \n#### Gravitational waves\nObserving the precisely timed pulses from various pulsars scattered across the galaxy, astronomers aim to measure the slight variations in their signals which are thought to be caused by gravitational waves. Pulsar timing arrays are being used to uncover secrets of the early universe by hopefully confirming the observation of gravitational waves caused by pairs of supermassive black holes in the early universe, multidimensional strings, quasars, and other possible events from the first few moments following the Big Bang.  \n#### Nuclear physics  \nWith pulsars being very small stellar objects(~10km radius) but having an average mass of ~1.4 solar masses, they are incredibly dense. In fact, the density of a pulsar is several times greater than the density of atomic nuclei. There is little understood about the physics of what goes on inside a pulsar and therefore are an incredibly interesting phenomena for physicists. \n#### Mapping interstellar space\nDue to the regularity of the emissions from pulsars, they can be used to triangulate position in the galaxy. Humanity has included pulsar maps on the two Pioneer plaques in addition to the Voyager Golden Record. These maps use 14 pulsars, and the position of the Sun to show where we are on the galactic plane. This form of navigation could prove to be very useful as Humanity progresses to a Type II civilization(see: [Kardashev Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)).\n#### Measuring time\nAgain, using the regularity of a pulsar's pulses one can measure the passing of time, specifically establishing Ephemeris time which is free of the irregular constraints related to fluctuating mean solar time. Although pulsars are very precise and regular, the interference in the readings make this form of time measurement slightly less accurate and dependable when compared to an atomic clock - this however may change as our radio telescopes become more advanced.

There are 8 continuous variables describing the stars, and a class variable indicating whether or not the stars are actually a pulsar or not. \n\nTo understand what these variables mean, we'll need to look into some terminology related to the classification of pulsars.  \n\n**Integrated Pulse Profile:**  \nPulsars are distinguished by their integrated pulse profile which is a representation of its periodic pulsation signal. It is a visual representation of the pulsars emission signals with respect to its rotational period. Here's some examples of integrated pulse profiles:[1] ![Integrated Pulse Profiles](Images/Pulsar_IPP1.png)  \n\n**DM-SNR Curve:**  \nDM = dispersion measure. SNR = spectral signal-to-noise ratio.  \nDispersion measurement is the spread in frequency of the pulsar's emission after traveling through space. Free electrons and ionization within the interstellar medium affects the radiation in two ways. Due to the dispersive nature of interstellar plasma, higher-frequency waves traverse these distances more quickly than lower-frequency radio waves. The resulting delay is referred to as the dispersion measure. In other words, the DM is the \"total column density of free electrons between the observer and the pulsar\".  \nThe spectral SNR is the signal to noise ratio of all DM signal measurements taken.  \nThis is a common way to differentiate and classify candidate stars. Pulsar timing is exact, like that of a delta function, but radio telescopes pickup a spread centered around the peak value. This measurement is represented by the DM value, of which there is a spread from multiple measurements peaked around some DM value. You then take your DM signals and compare them as a signal-to-noise ratio for each candidate. \n\n- **Mean of the itegrated profile** - A mean taken from the respective pulsar's IPP.  \n- **Standard deviation of the integrated profile** - The standard deviation of a pulsar's IPP.  \n- **Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile** - Kurtosis measures the \"fatness\" of the tails of a given distribution. Positive excess kurtosis means a distribution has larger tails than a normal distribution. This means there is a less accurate distribution and may point to more noise.  \n- **Skewness of the integrated profile** - Skewness measures the asymettry of a distribution. In this context, if a candidate star's IPP has a negative skew, the signal is strong initially but then tapers off quickly. If a candidate star has a positive skew, the signal is first small before peaking to the right side of the distribution.  \n- **Mean of the DM-SNR curve** - This is the mean value of all dispersion measurments of a given star's signal to noise ratio.  \n- **Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve** - The standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve shows how much variation is found in the measurements of a candidate star. The higher the standard deviation could suggest there is more noise and/or interference affecting the measurements.  \n- **Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve** - High levels of DM-SNR kurtosis suggests more noise in an observation. \n- **Skewness of the DM-SNR curve** - A highly skewed DM-SNR curve means that there's a high amount of interference in the observation which could mean that there's a lot of ISM noise in between the candidate star and the radio telescope recording the signals.  \n- **target_class** - Is this candidate a pulsar?(1:yes, 0:no)\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Scrub the Data\nNow that my data has been imported, the focus will shift to preprocessing the data to be able to give us some accurate models.

Kurtosis and skewness of the IPP \nare close to normal, but both are ever so slightly positively skewed.  \nAs mentioned before, I will model both the raw data and transformed & normalized data \nto see if there is an increase in accuracy from normalizing these attributes.   \n\nWhen we examine the scatterplots that display the relationships between the skewness\nand kurtosis of the IPP and DM-SNR curves when related to the target_class, we can \nmake the following assumptions:   \nThe higher the kurtosis and skewness of the IPP, the more likely it is that the candidate star is a pulsar.   \nThe lower kurtosis and skewness of the DM-SNR curve, the more likely it is that the candidate star is a pulsar.   \n\nBy looking at the boxplots of the attributes, here are some brief summaries of what is shown:   \n- The mean of the IPP appears to be higher for false positives.    \n- The standared deviation of the IPP for the false positives appear to be slightly higher and have more upper end outliers.   \n- The kurtosis of the IPP seems to be smaller/close to 0 for false positives.   \n- The skewness of the IPP again is around 0 for false positives, while for actual pulsars, it is much larger.   \n- The mean of the DM-SNR curve is typically higher for actual pulsars, compared to false positives.   \n- The standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve is higher for actual pulsars than false positives.  \n- The kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve is higher for false positives than for actual pulsars.   \n- The skewness of the DM-SNR curve is significantly higher for false positives than for actual pulsars.    \n\nFinally, we can see again in the histograms that there are no normal distributions and \nnone of our data is categorical.

As more data becomes available, this cycle can repeat and continue in a loop to build a faster, less biased, and more accurate model. For now, I'll review the models completed with the data available.  \n\n### Model Performance (Top 3 models, comparing metrics)\n\nThese findings are presented in the following format: (tuned) base. All models scored a 97.72% Validation accuracy, supporting their resistance to overtraining. \n\n| Classifier | Accuracy Score | Macro Avg. F1 Score | Target Class F1 score | False Pos | False Neg | AUC | Runtime(sec) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| XGBoost | (98)99 | (.93).93 | (.88).87 | (33)30 | (67)72 | (.97).97 | 0.673 |\n| AdaBoost | (98)98 | (.93).93 | (.86).87 | (31)29 | (77)74 | (.97).97 | 1.230 |\n| Bagging Tree | (97)98 | (.91).93 | (.83).88 | (20)29 | (107)71 | (.96).95 | 1.237 |\n\nThe three best performing classifiers were XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging Tree. They all were able to produce high accuracy, high validation test scores, and low numbers of type I and type II errors. XGBoost performed narrowly better than the latter two, with a higher accuracy, macro average F1 score, Target class F1 score, and AUC. All of the top 3 models scored a 97.72 in validation score, showing their resistance to overtraining. Also, the top 3 models all had similar type I and type II errors.  \n\nComing from a baseline model with a <20% accuracy, there was significant improvement made by dealing with class imbalances, using more robust algorithms, and tuning those algorithms to the ideal parameters. \n\nXGBoost is the ideal model, based off of accuracy, validation, and runtime. \n\n\n### Feature Importance\n\nBy far, excess kurtosis of the Integrated Pulse Profile was the most important feature for classifying these candidate stars.  \n\nBy examining the feature importance charts, we can see how impactful it was in the XGBoost and Adaboost models. The Bagging Tree classifier seems to be less one dimensional in that regard and shows a fairly high importance for Standard Deviation of the DM-SNR curve, and the Mean of the IPP.  \n\n\n### EDA Summary -  Confirming Suspicions\n\nNow to revisit my post-EDA impressions below:\nBy looking at the target class counts bar chart, we can clearly see there is a \nlarge class imbalance. True positives of our target class instance only make\nup 9% of the dataset. \n\nThe two features of kurtosis and skewness of the integrated pulse profile are \nclosely correlated, in the early stages of the modeling section, I may end up removing\none of them. I will reexamine that after doing some baseline modeling and begin\ndoing feature selection and engineering.   \nThe mean and standard deviation  of the DM-SNR curve attributes also seem to be\ncorrelated, but again, that will be revisited in the early stages of modeling. \nAlso, the kurtosis and skewness of the DM-SNR curve also seem to be correlated. \nFinally, the kurtosis of the integrated pulse profile seems to be fairly correlated(.79)\nwith our target_class. I'll continue to test this correlation and see if there is a \ntrue, solid relationship between them.   \n\nBy comparing the means between our attributes to the target class, we can see some\npossible relationships in the pointplots. It seems that the higher the mean of the \nintegrated pulse profile and the skewness of the the DM-SNR curve, the less likely\nthe candidate stars are to be actual pulsars.   \nWhen we look at the standard deviation of the two classes compared to one another, \nthe higher the skewness of the DM-SNR curve also seems to suggest a higher likelihood\nof being a false positive.   \n\nNone of the features follow a true normal distribution. Kurtosis and skewness of the IPP \nare close to normal, but both are ever so slightly positively skewed.  \nAs mentioned before, I will model both the raw data and transformed & normalized data \nto see if there is an increase in accuracy from normalizing these attributes.   \n\nWhen we examine the scatterplots that display the relationships between the skewness\nand kurtosis of the IPP and DM-SNR curves when related to the target_class, we can \nmake the following assumptions:   \nThe higher the kurtosis and skewness of the IPP, the more likely it is that the candidate star is a pulsar.   \nThe lower kurtosis and skewness of the DM-SNR curve, the more likely it is that the candidate star is a pulsar.   \n\nBy looking at the boxplots of the attributes, here are some brief summaries of what is shown:   \n- The mean of the IPP appears to be higher for false positives.    \n- The standared deviation of the IPP for the false positives appear to be slightly higher and have more upper end outliers.   \n- The kurtosis of the IPP seems to be smaller/close to 0 for false positives.   \n- The skewness of the IPP again is around 0 for false positives, while for actual pulsars, it is much larger.   \n- The mean of the DM-SNR curve is typically higher for actual pulsars, compared to false positives.   \n- The standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve is higher for actual pulsars than false positives.  \n- The kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve is higher for false positives than for actual pulsars.   \n- The skewness of the DM-SNR curve is significantly higher for false positives than for actual pulsars.    \n\nFinally, we can see again in the histograms that there are no normal distributions and \nnone of our data is categorical. \n\nAs I had expected, the kurtosis of the IPP was strongly related to confirming a True Positive. \n\n### Final Thoughts - Recommendations and Potential Future Work\n\n#### Model Selection\nI recommend using XGBoost. It is a faster, more robust model, capable of high levels of accuracy and validation. \n\n#### Business Value\nOverall, our model(s) performed well and could prove to be valuable assets to the field. With the ability to quickly and reliably classify candidate stars, we can more easily identify pulsars to study further. \n\n#### Larger Dataset\nFor future work, I would find it beneficial to have a larger dataset, with more anomolies in it to be able to refine our model even further. Looking at other forms of radio interference and how to train our telescopes to avoid misclassification of these candidate stars would help \"trim the fat\" off of a larger dataset and effectively pre-process for us. \n\n#### More Computational Power\nIt would be beneficial in the case of a larger dataset to be able to take advantage of a supercomputer or a distributed system to be able to efficiently process massive datasets. These things are more available in the research scenarios and professional observational astronomy labs. \n\n#### More Complex ML / DL\nI am curious to see if more advanced machine learning & deep learning techniques would yeild better results.
