{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is the Apriori algorithm?\nApriori uses a breadth-first search strategy to count the support of itemsets and uses a candidate generation function that exploits the downward closure property of support. We apply an iterative approach or level-wise search where k-frequent itemsets are used to find k+1 itemsets.\n\n## Apriori Property –\nAll subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent(Apriori propertry).\nIf an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets will be infrequent.\n\n### **The following are the main steps of the algorithm:**\n* Calculate the support of item sets (of size k = 1) in the transactional database (note that support is the frequency of occurrence of an itemset). This is called generating the candidate set.\n\n* Prune the candidate set by eliminating items with a support less than the given threshold.\n\n* Join the frequent itemsets to form sets of size k + 1, and repeat the above sets until no more itemsets can be formed. This will happen when the set(s) formed have a support less than​ the given support.\n\n## Bakery Market Basket Analysis \nMarket Basket Analysis is used to increase marketing effectiveness and to improve cross-sell and up-sell opportunities by making the right offer to the right customer. For a retailer, good promotions translate into increased revenue and profits. The objectives of the market basket analysis models are to identify the next product that the customer might be interested to purchase or to browse.\" \n\nRight! Before we implement the algorithm just for the sake of showing off our skills, what is our goal? As discussed previously we are here to determine up-sell opportunities. Let's start with some general questions as a framework: What sort of relationships do we wish to discover? and then, naturally: how would discovering such relationships help the business owner's bottom line? for now, let's keep these in the back of our mind.\n\n\n* Can we get rid of a product 'X' because it is sold infrequently?\nIf the business owner wishes to get rid of a product in order to save any cost and overhead associated with it but unknowingly is getting rid of a product that is part of an item set 'X' and 'Y' where both X and Y are complements, it might not be as straightforward since it may impact other products.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## If you find this kernel usefull please UPVOTE
