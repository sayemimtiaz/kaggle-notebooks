Many researchers use **Prophet** (from Facebook). But for some reason, no one takes into account the holidays impact. After all, despite all the prohibitions, it is difficult for people to stay at home and they still somehow celebrate the **holidays** to which they are accustomed. The desire to celebrate is especially strong when people are sitting at home all the time looking for something to do. In my opinion, the impact of the holidays is manifested in the fact that within 4-10 days after these holidays there may be a jump in the number of confirmed cases, due to the fact that people went shopping, and even visiting each other, perhaps even in violation of quarantine requirements. \n\nThe Prophet uses the library [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) with information about the main holidays of 67 countries, but and its package has some disadvantages. That's why I created a more perfect own dataset and plan to update it periodically. Now **my dataset [COVID-19: Holidays of countries](https://www.kaggle.com/vbmokin/covid19-holidays-of-countries) has holidays for 70 countries** and more adapted for use in the prediction of coronavirus diseases.\n\nHolidays and pseudo-holidays (**anomalies dates**) are defined in three ways:\n- dates of official public holidays;\n- the weakening of quarantine according to open data;\n- dates of very comfortable conditions for rest (there are more 95% quantile on average temperature and not more 5% quantile of rainfall) - for each country it should be adapted individually (open data NOAA are used)\n\nThe model is **tuning in two stages** - makes a complete search of values from 4 possible for each feature at first for one part of parameters, then - for another. In the second stage, the optimal parameters determined in the first stage are used. Each stage ends with an interactive graph (library \"plotly\"), which clearly shows the WAPE for each combination of parameters.\n\nThe Prophet model with all optimized parameters and holidays is used for **forecasting** future data for the next days and visualization of forecasting results. The data is taken from [COVID-19 Open Data](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data) (usually this dataset are updated there daily and are available as of yesterday), so the next days are counted from the date of the last committee of this notebook."},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.094441,"end_time":"2020-12-05T12:07:59.183643","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-05T12:07:59.089202","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"0.1\"></a>\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.
