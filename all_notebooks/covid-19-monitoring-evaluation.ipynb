The article states - [Available here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/opinion/coronavirus-testing-pneumonia.html)\n\nPneumonia caused by the coronavirus has had a stunning impact on the city’s hospital system. Normally an E.R. has a mix of patients with conditions ranging from the serious, such as heart attacks, strokes and traumatic injuries, to the nonlife-threatening, such as minor lacerations, intoxication, orthopedic injuries and migraine headaches.\n\nThese patients did not report any sensation of breathing problems, even though their chest X-rays showed diffuse pneumonia and their oxygen was below normal. We are just beginning to recognize that Covid pneumonia initially causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call “silent hypoxia” — “silent” because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature.\n\nPneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with fluid or pus. Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. But when Covid pneumonia first strikes, patients don’t feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays).\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id='findings'><h3>The findings from the Analyses</h3></a>\n\n1.

Hence, ICU might be required for that patients.\n\n**The above mentioned clinical figures are related to pneumonia ailments. This undetected figures, among populations can be a main source of deaths related to COVID-19. These clinical figures, might go undetected, becuase of which hospitalization is given to patients who become very serious, leading to death.
