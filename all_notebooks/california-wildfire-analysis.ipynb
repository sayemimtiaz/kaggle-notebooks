The CAL FIRE Dept. learnt from their deficiencies and took necessary actions which was evident in the number and control of wildfires in the year 2019. \n\nIn summary,\n* The total number of incidents in the year 2018 is less than that of 2017 by 28 % where as the land area affected is about 187% more. This means that, in totality, the wildfires in 2018 were severe and larger.\n* (Severity)  The percentage of major fire incident has been more than 50 % since 2016 until 2019.\n* (Learning from the Past) The number of wildfires in the year 2019 is much lower than that of 2018 because of the serverity of the wildfires in 2018 that resulted in extra funding, equipment and better handling of wildfires in 2019 as mentioned in California State Budget Summary.\n* (Technological Progress) Due to advancements in wildfire handling technology, lower number of deployed personnel can handle larger and expansive of wildfires as evident from the years 2013 and 2018 where in 2018 the number of wildfires in 200 % whereas the personnel deployed is less than by around 23 %. A similar conclusion can be drawn for the number of water tenders involved.\n* (Who does how much) A Fire Administrative unit handles around 15-20 fires in the span of 6 years. The most wildfire prone regions handle at a maximum of 80-120 wildfires.\n* Looking at the administrative zones for the California Fire Dept. (shown below) we observe that the Riverside, San Diego, San Luis Obispo and Shasta-Trinity Unit are the top four administrative zones dealing with fire.\n* San Diego Fire Unit has been in the top 5 wildires handling unit throughout the years (2013-2019).\n* Riverside Fire Unit has handled wildfires only in years 2013, 2017 and 2018, yet has still handled the most number of incidents than any other unit (2013-2019).\n* There has been an increase in severity of wildfires upto 68.3 % of all the wildfires and total fatalities occuring being 95 % of all the fatalities since 2017 which are mostly concentrated towards south-east region of California - Riverside Unit (RRU) and San Diego Fire Unit.\n* Major wildfire incidents have mostly occured near regions of large population density and mostly concentrated towards South Eastern regions (San Diego and Riverside) of the state. This trend has become more prevalent since the year 2017.This is the topic of the article (California’s wildfires are hardly “natural” — humans made them worse at every step).\n* Wildfires since 2017 have been mostly concentrated in the same regions which vastly span the state of California. These regions have now been identified (in 2018) as priority landscapes for reducing wildfire risks.\n* Creek fire is the most fire prone zone in California.\n* The Worst wildfire occured in the Butte Counties on November, 2018 with 85 fatalities.\n* Wildfires with long fire durations occured in the years 2017 and 2018. With an average duration of around 190 hours, orders of magnitude larger than in other years.\n* Fires are either dealt-with relatively fast within 20 days or as large as upto 200 days.
