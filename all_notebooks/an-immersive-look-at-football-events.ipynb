Hence our model predicts almost all no-goal events correctly, but the events that matter i.e. the goals, are also predicted as no-goals, hence the high accuracy score but low relaibilty.\n* Take for example fraud detection. If 99/100 times a transaction is not a fraud, and a model that predicts it, has a 99% accuracy, it will predict the harmless transactions accurately, but when we need it the most , i.e. when there is a fraudulent transaction, it may fail to predict it. Hence, when the weight of the predicted outcome is different or the dataset is imbalanced, accuracy will not be a good measure of effectiveness of the model.\n* To counter this, lets reduce the number of no-goal events and see the performance of the model, by reducing the amount of no-goal events to avout 60%-70% of the dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.is_goal.value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"new_train=pd.concat([train[train.is_goal==0].sample(n=79144),train[train.is_goal==1]])\nx_train,x_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(new_train.drop(['is_goal','season'],axis=1),new_train.is_goal,test_size=0.2)\nlogreg1=LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear',C=0.025)\nlogreg1.fit(x_train,y_train)\nlets_test=xg_stats_final.loc[for_season[(for_season.season==2016)&(for_season.player=='jamie vardy')&(for_season.event_type==1)].index]\ny_test=logreg1.predict(lets_test.drop(['is_goal','season'],axis=1))\nprint(f'precision score = {precision_score(lets_test.is_goal,y_test)}',f'predicted counts = {np.unique(y_test,return_counts=True)}',sep='\\n')\nprint('   0    1',f'0 {confusion_matrix(lets_test.is_goal,y_test)[0]}',f'1 {confusion_matrix(lets_test.is_goal,y_test)[1]}',sep='\\n')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our model predicted that, Jamie Vardy should have scored 22 goals in the 2016 season.
