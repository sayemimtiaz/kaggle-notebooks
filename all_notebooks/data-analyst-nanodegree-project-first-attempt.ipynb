We're gonna explore the [*no-show appointments dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) dataset using this variables:\n\n- **PatientId:** Identification of a patient \n- **AppointmentID:** Identification of each appointment \n- **Gender:** Male or Female \n- **DataMarcacaoConsulta:** The day of the actuall appointment, when they have to visit the doctor \n- **DataAgendamento:** The day someone called or registered the appointment\n- **Age:** How old is the patient \n- **Neighbourhood:** Where the appointment takes place\n- [**Scholarship:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia) True or False, indicates if the patient is in the *Bolsa Familia* program\n- **Hipertension:** True or False\n- **Diabetes:** True or False \n- **Alcoholism:** True or False \n- **Handcap:** True or False \n- **SMS_received:** 1 or more messages sent to the patient \n- **No-show** \"No\" indicates if the patient showed up to their appointment and \"Yes\" if they didn't show up\n\nWe're aiming to find possible reasons for patient no-showing at the scheduled appointments."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# first let's load our data\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/medicalappointmentnoshown/KaggleV2-May-2016.csv\")\ndf.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's see from which period theese appointments are\ndf.AppointmentDay.min(), df.AppointmentDay.max()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# then let's see the shape of our data\ndf.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# and get general numeric attributes\ndf.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"first-impressions\"></a>\n### 1.1. First impressions\n\nFirst of all, we can notice that:\n- We have 110k+ rows and 14 columns in this dataset (as explained on the challenge overview)\n- I want to check if the patientId is duplicated since I don't know if they can have more than one appointment\n- Depending on the analysis, maybe the **PatientId**, **AppointmentID** and **Neighbourhood** be useless for the analysis\n- It's important to highlight that the **No-show** column value **Yes** means that the pacient didn't show at the appointment\n\nAlso we can already draw some assumptions:\n- there are more than 100k appointments scheduled in a period of ~2 months and that's really impressive\n- most of the patients have about 37 yeas old with almost no scholarship (9%)\n- in mean \n  - 19% of the patients have hipertension\n  - 7% of the patients have diabetes\n  - 3% of the patients suffers from alcoholism\n  - 2% of the patients are handicapped\n  \nI'll analyse the **\"No-Show\"** as my dependent variable since to me it's the most important one and it's strongly related to what we want to discover here.\n\nAnd I'll use all dataset variables in my analysis, I just want to check on the **Data wrangling** stage if we really need the:\n- Patient id\n- Appointment id\n- Neighbourhood\n\nSince it look's like this variables are not that important for this analysis.\n\n<a id=\"questions\"></a>\n### 1.2. Questions\n\nThe main questions I want to answer are:\n- Based on the variables we have, what is the most relevant factor that is influencing the patient to no showing the medical appointment?\n- There are any relation on these variables that can lead us to a more specific group of patients?\n- The day of the week of the appointment influences the patient no showing?\n- The waiting time of the patient between the schedule day and the appointment day influences it's no showing?\n- There are patients no showing in appointments on the same day?\n\n<a id='wrangling'></a>\n## 2. Data Wrangling\n\nIn this section the data will be analysed and cleaned, dealing with missing values or weird values.\nAlso we're gonna explore in a deeper lever in a way that maybe we can formulate more questions.\n\n<a id=\"general-properties\"></a>\n### 2.1. General Properties\n\nHere we're gonna explore our dataset properties checking for:\n- What kind of variables we need to:\n  - convert the data type\n  - drop from the dataset\n- Check for duplicates\n- Check for weird values (outliers)\n- Gather more information about a specific variable\n- Check if we need to create more columns with usefull data for the exploration"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking column information for missing values and strange types\ndf.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking for general data duplicates\ndf.duplicated().sum(), df.PatientId.duplicated().sum(), df.AppointmentID.duplicated().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking all possible values on some columns\nprint(df.Gender.unique())\nprint(sorted(df.Age.unique()))\nprint(sorted(df.Neighbourhood.unique()))\nprint(df.Scholarship.unique())\nprint(df.Hipertension.unique())\nprint(df.Diabetes.unique())\nprint(df.Alcoholism.unique())\nprint(df.Handcap.unique())\nprint(df.SMS_received.unique())\nprint(df['No-show'].unique())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It looks like we have a good dataset: \n- no missing lines \n- we discover that indeed we need the **Patient ID** since it seems some patients try to make new appointments\n- there are no weird values on most columns\n\nBut we'll need to do some cleaning here:\n- we need to fix some data typings\n  - ScheduledDay and AppointmentDay makes sense to be a date/datetime type\n  - No-Show makes sense to be a boolean\n  - PatientId makes sense to be converted as string to prevent from being applied as a numerical operation since it represents the patient identification\n- **Appointment ID** seems to not be usefull for this analysis\n- **Handcap** variable have values beyond True and False, and we can see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/discussion/29699#229356) that this occurs because the handcap field represents the number of patient disabilities\n\nAnd we can also make more questions:\n- On the problem summary they don't mention on which location we're analysing, I've thought that we're analysing data from several cities from Brazil, but it seams that we're seing a specific region\n  - We can see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/discussion/38330#) that this dataset contains appointments from *Vitória - ES* in Brazil and this turns out to be even more impressive that there are more than 100k schedulled in a ~2 month period in 2016\n  \nNow we can analyse also the neighbourhood data either!\n\n<a id=\"data-cleaning\"></a>\n### 2.2. Data Cleaning\n\nHere we're need to:\n- remove useless columns\n- rename the columns to use easier names during the exploration while fixing typos\n- format patient id column to string\n- format all date related columns to the correct type\n- remove the weird age value that is less than zero\n- format the handicap field correctly, since we only want to know if the patient is handicap and not how many disabilities they have\n- add new columns\n  - appointment_week_day: to show what day of the week the appointment was scheduled\n  - appointment_waiting_time: waiting time to the appointment"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's remove some useless columns\n# I think the appointmentID is useless for this analysis\ndf.drop(['AppointmentID'], axis=1, inplace=True)\ndf.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# renaming all columns to simpler names for our exploration\ndf.rename(columns={'PatientId': 'patient_id', 'ScheduledDay': 'scheduled_day', 'AppointmentDay': 'appointment_day', 'SMS_received': 'received_sms', 'No-show': 'no_show', 'Handcap': 'handicap' }, inplace=True)\ndf.rename(columns=lambda x: x.lower(), inplace=True)\ndf.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# formatting the patient_id column as string\ndf.patient_id = df.patient_id.apply(lambda patient: str(int(patient)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# formatting the date time 'scheduled_day' and 'appointment_day' columns\n# i'm just testing different forms of time conversion here\ndf.scheduled_day = pd.to_datetime(df.scheduled_day)\ndf.appointment_day = df.appointment_day.apply(np.datetime64)\n\ndf.scheduled_day.head(1), df.appointment_day.head(1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# formatting the 'no_show' column with lower cases\ndf.no_show = df.no_show.map({ 'No': 'no', 'Yes': 'yes' })\n\ndf.no_show.unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# discart the ages bellow zero\ndf = df.query('age >= 0')\nprint(sorted(df.age.unique()))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# remove the weird values from handcap variable\ndf.loc[df.handicap > 1, 'handicap'] = 1\ndf.handicap.unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating the first column \"appointment_week_day\"\ndf['appointment_week_day'] = df.appointment_day.map(lambda day: day.day_name())\ndf.appointment_week_day.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# creating the second column \"appointment_waiting_time\"\ndf[\"appointment_waiting_days\"] = df.appointment_day - df.scheduled_day\ndf.appointment_waiting_days.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# well it seams that some are treated on the same day that they scheduled\n# we can prevent that weird value by calculating the the \"absolute value\" of this column\n# and then converting the \"time\" to \"days\"\ndf.appointment_waiting_days = df.appointment_waiting_days.abs().dt.days\ndf.appointment_waiting_days.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's see how our data looks like after all cleanning\ndf.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It seams we have all the data we need to start exploring and answer the questions.\n\n<a id='eda'></a>\n## 3.

Answering questions\n\n#### Based on the variables we have, what is the most relevant factor that is influencing the patient to no showing the medical appointment?\n\nThere isn't a clear conclusin here, we actually see a lot of interesting insights analysing:\n- Age\n- Waiting days\n- Received Sms\n- Appointment week day\n- Gender\n- Neighbourhood\n- Duplicated patients\n\nWe only can discart the **received sms** since the difference is not meaningfull to reach any conclusion.\n\nBut all other variables have great relevance that may influences the patient to no showing.\n\nMaybe we can in a further analysis mix them up to find a more interesting pattern.\n\n#### There are any relation on these variables that can lead us to a more specific group of patients?\n\nYes, we found some specific group of patients:\n\n- Age \n  - younger patients tend to no-showing\n- Waiting days\n  - elder patients tend to schedule their appointments for long periods of waiting days\n- Neighbourhood\n  - we found some places that have a more frequent no-showing rate that could be further analysed\n- Duplicated patients\n  - the group of patients that have from 1 to 20 appointments scheduled\n\n#### The day of the week of the appointment influences the patient no showing?\n\nActually not that much, there is a very subtle decrease of the no-showing rate for patients that attend on **Thursdays**\n\n#### The waiting time of the patient between the schedule day and the appointment day influences it's no showing?\n\nYes, most of the patients are attended on the same day having the lowest no-show rate.\n\nAfter that the no-showing rate grows until reach a quarter (~90 days) of waiting, after that the rate start dropping.\n\n#### There are patients no showing in appointments on the same day?\n\nYes, but is one of the lowest rate of no-showing rate of the groups.\n\n<a id='conclusions'></a>\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nThis analysis had as purpose to perform an analysis of a database of medical consultations, containing more than 100k appointments which approximately **30%** of the patients have not attended.\n\nThe notebook had the purpose of gather some insights on the possible causes of this missing appointments.\n\nI would also like to leave a warning that it is not possible to affirm any veracity of the provided statements and statistical validity of the data but the insights obtained through this analysis can, so instead, inform and direct in-depth research on the subject in order to validate the causes of the missing appointments and find more conclusive insights.\n\nWe find some interesting insights analysing the attributes, summing up:\n\n### Dataset/Analysis limitations\n\nDuring our entire report we faced limitations and challenges.\n\n- Some informations are not clear in the description of the dataset and you can only find that missing piece by looking out on the forum on some posts\n- We do not have confirmations of where the data comes from, even though it is public services that the author clarified [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/discussion/28825161646)\n- There is no guarantee that the patientsID are being exposed correctly or even if is an anonymous one\n- We don't have acess on how many health units share the same patient databse may causing some inconsistency on the data provided, maybe we have the same patient with different IDs or general data\n- Some informations about the columns of the dataset was outdated, for example, the **handicap** is documented as \"True/False\" variable but in the dataset it represents the amount of disabilites of the patients\n- The lack of more data on the dataset about some variables like **neighbourhood** don't permit we do a in-depth analysis to really give any conclusion about the no-show rate since there are a huge difference associating the displacement habits of each patient and the socioeconomic characteristics of each neighborhood\n- There are a few inconsistences on the dataset that need to be verified for example, negative age values and weird scheduling dates\n- The analysis was limited to categorize the patient waiting time / amount of appointments and analysing the mix of the attributes and I have a limited math skill so its not possible to provide relevant insights that could lead us to a relevant conclusion\n\n### Age\n\nThe no-showing rate of age decresases as older the person is. \n\nIt reaches higher rates when the patient is a **baby/child** and the lowest rates when the patient is around **96 years old.**\n\nThe higher rates may occur because:\n- parents or guardians may have difficulties bringing the child to the appointment\n- there was a long wait until the attendance (but we'll se more about that later)\n\nAnd the lower rates may occur because:\n- we're dealing with older population meaning that as times goes by people tend to visit and be present at health appointments\n\n### Waiting days\n\nWe groupped the waiting days in categories:\n\n| waiting time | days |\n| -- | -- |\n| same day | 0 |\n| week | 1 - 7 |\n| month | 8 - 30 |\n| quarter | 31 - 90 |\n| semester | 91 - 180 |\n| a lot of time | > 180 |\n\nThe no-showing rate increases as time goes by until it reach a quarter.\n\nIt reaches lower rates when the patient is attended on the same day and start decreasing after a quarter of waiting time.\n\nWe can see on the table bellow the characteristics of patients splitted by the groups.\n\n|              | Attended on the same day | Attended in a short period (week - month) | Attended in a period of 31-90 days (quarter) | Attended in a long period (> 90 days) |\n| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Average age  | 35 years                 | 38 years                                  | 37 years                                     | **58 years**                          |\n| Scholarship  | **~10%**                 | ~9%                                       | ~6%                                          | ~7%                                   |\n| Hipertension | ~18%                     | ~21%                                      | ~15%                                         | **~57%**                              |\n| Diabetes     | ~7%                      | 7%~                                       | ~4%                                          | **~14%**                              |\n\nFrom this analysis we can conclude that the drastic drop on the no-show rating from the period longer than a quarter probably is **due to being an older public** who require regular medical follow-up and tend to schedule more appointments.\n\n### Received Sms\n\nWe didn't found any relevant aspect that can bring a consistent insight by analysing this attribute.\n\nOnly that patients that have received sms have they're no-show rate **increased** in **~10%** related to patients that haven't received any reminder.\n\n### Appointment week day\n\nThe no-showing rate increases during the week as soon as it starts.\n\nBut we have a small drop on **Thursdays** but is not that significant compared to all other weekdays.\n\n### Gender\n\nThere is a big difference on the amount of woman attending to consultations compared to the men.\n\nWe have a large amount of female patients, assuming the context that women tend to care more about their health than man due to the massive difference from the consultants as we can see [here](https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/health-answers/why-men-dont-go-to-the-doctor/). \n\nBut woman and men have a similar no-showing proportion.\n\n### Neighbourhood\n\nSince we're analysing data from *Vitória - ES* we can see that **Jardim Camburi** is the one with most of the appointments in the state and actually is the [most populous neighbourhood from \"Espírito Santo\"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardim_Camburi).\n\nThe no-showing rate increases as the waiting gets longer for most of neighborhood.\n\nWe have a small rate difference for each local, some neighborhoods have higher no-showing rates even for short waiting times (ex: Ilha do Boi and Comdusa).\n\nSince we don't have enough data we can't investigate further for the reasons on such occurrences.\n\n### Duplicated patients\n\nWe checked out patients that have more than one appointment having a no-show rate of **~20%** in this cases.\n\nThe rate of not attending is higher on patients that schedule from 1 to 20 appointments **~21%**\n\nThis rate drastically drop from patients on the **> 21 appointment group** to **~10%** and patients **> 41 appointments** this rate drops even further to **~3%**\n\nThis rate drastically drop from patients on the **> 21 appointment group** to **~10%** and patients **> 41 appointments** this rate drops even further to **~3%** since they seems to be regular patients\n\n## References\n\n- Wikipedia -
