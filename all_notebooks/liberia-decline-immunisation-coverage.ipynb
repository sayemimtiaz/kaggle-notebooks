Wesseh,corresponding  R. Najjemba, J. K. Edwards,, P. Owiti,, H. Tweya,, and P. Bhat\n\nResults: Immunisation coverage for fully immunised children before the Ebola outbreak was 73%. Immunisation coverage for all antigens declined by half compared to baseline during the outbreak. These findings were similar in facility-based and outreach immunisations. During the outbreak, the proportion of fully immunised children dropped by respectively 58%, 33% and 39% in the most, moderately and least Ebola-affected counties. Immunisation rate of recovery in the post-Ebola period was respectively 82%, 21% and 9% in the most, moderately and least affected counties compared to the Ebola-outbreak period. Outreach immunisation recovered slowly compared to facility-based immunisation. The mean number of measles cases reported per month was 12 pre-Ebola, 16 Ebola and 60 post-Ebola.\n\nConclusion: This study provides insights into the possible impact of an Ebola outbreak on countrywide immunisation. The outbreak weakened a struggling national immunisation programme, and post-outbreak recovery took significant time, which likely contributed to the measles epidemic. Recommendations for the improvement of immunisation services that could limit further preventable epidemics in Liberia and similar contexts at risk for Ebola are provided. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515569/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSmRcXU8ywuDjEfKI7_NY0zk_959SF8mgXhgg&usqp=CAU)facebook.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n#Gavi The Vaccine Alliance https://www.gavi.org/\n\"The essence of routine immunisation is to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases.

The first cases of EVD in Liberia were reported in March 2014. The impact of the outbreak overwhelmed an already weak health care system; lapses in infection control at health care facilities led to the deaths of almost half (184/372) of the health care workers (HCWs) who were infected. This caused alarm among HCWs in facilities due to the risk of EVD, estimated at 30 times higher than in the general population, and many public and private health facilities were temporarily closed. A sense of apprehension was created among those who used health facilities, with significant concerns that they or their family members might contract EVD if they visited these facilities.\n\nAlthough improvements have been reported in the immunisation coverage for most antigens in Liberia, the performance of the national immunisation programme was suboptimal before the outbreak. The 2013 Demographic and Health Survey indicated 55% immunisation coverage for children aged 12–23 months,6 and there were repeated measles outbreaks in previous years. This dismal performance may have resulted from the country's intermittent turbulent political past as well as from the significant challenges of maintaining adequate vaccine supplies and managing the necessary cold chain requirements by the Ministry of Health (MoH).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515569/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/countryclustering/country_cluster.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The \"No Touch\" Policy\n\nThe Ebola outbreak likely compromised the immunisation programme further. The ‘no touch’ policy and restriction of invasive procedures, plus the suspension of routine immunisations in some counties during the outbreak, may have resulted in vaccination opportunities being missed. All planned national immunisation campaigns were suspended during the outbreak, and due to human resource constraints, HCWs were not in a position to extend immunisation through outreach services. Likewise, the community perceptions of an increased risk of contracting EVD in health facilities may have prevented care givers from seeking immunisation services for their children.\n\nThe effects of the Ebola outbreak are particularly relevant to the immunisation programme, as children aged ⩽4 years are among those with the highest risk for mortality from EVD. This group is also at the highest risk of mortality from other preventable childhood infectious diseases, such as measles, pneumonia and meningitis. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children receive the following vaccines before 1 year of age: `BACCILLE CALMETTE-GUÉRIN (BCG)`, polio, pentavalent (diphtheria, pertussis, Haemophilus influenze, tetanus, hepatitis B), measles, yellow fever and pneumococcal.13 To attain herd immunity in a target population, immunisation coverage for most antigens should be at least 85%.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515569/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking dataset\n\nprint (\"Rows     : \" ,df.shape[0])\nprint (\"Columns  : \" ,df.shape[1])\nprint (\"\\nFeatures : \\n\" ,df.columns.tolist())\nprint (\"\\nMissing values :  \", df.isnull().sum().values.sum())\nprint (\"\\nUnique values :  \\n\",df.nunique())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Gap on the Effects of the Outbreak on Immunisation Services.\n\nThe virulent nature of the disease, coupled with infection and deaths among health workers, led to a significant decrease in the use of and access to primary health care services, including the routine immunisation programme for children aged <1 year. The countrywide consequences of the Ebola outbreak on the immunisation programme in Liberia remain largely unknown. No peer-reviewed studies have specifically assessed the effects of the outbreak on child immunisation at national level in affected countries.\n\nThe present study aimed to examine the effects of the Ebola outbreak on national immunisation services, with specific objectives to estimate, at the national level, 1) the number of children aged <1 year who received the recommended vaccines; 2) the number of immunisations given at fixed facilities and outreach settings; and 3) the number of reported cases of measles and pertussis (coqueluche in portughese) among children aged <5 years before, during and after the outbreak.\n\nThe insights from this study will contribute to bridging the knowledge gap on the effects of the outbreak on immunisation services and will guide both the post-Ebola recovery process and strategic planning for future outbreak responses in Liberia and elsewhere. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515569/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(x=\"BCG\",data=df,palette=\"flag\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.title('BCG', weight='bold')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.yticks(rotation=45)\n# changing the font size\nsns.set(font_scale=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The immunisation programme\n\nIn 2015, routine vaccines (BCG, oral polio, pentavalent, measles, yellow fever and pneumococcal) were provided free of charge in 522 health facilities.
