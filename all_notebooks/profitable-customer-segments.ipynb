I look forward to see what others try with this task, I'm really curious what I may not have found. \n\nEach of the models that I created did rather poorly at predicting an outcome of 0 (where neither group was profitable). One possibility that I did not explore was the option of training a seperate model (probably a decision tree) and tune it to just detect 0 or not 0 outcome. Including such model in the stack could have been useful.\n\nI'll also acknowledge that I'm not overly experienced with model stacking/blending so I may have overlooked some better model designs. \n\nCurrently I'm challenging myself to complete one Kaggle Task per week.
