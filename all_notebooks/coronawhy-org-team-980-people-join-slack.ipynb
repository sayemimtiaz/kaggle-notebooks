Historical Introduction (as of Mar 19,2020)  <a id=\"introduction\"></a>\nMy name is Artur Kiulian, at this point it does not matter who I am and what I do other than that we all need to do everything we can to help our society battle this crisis.\nI am creating this notebook as a response to the lack of self-organization and collaboration that I am experiecing while trying to organize an effective collaboration.\nHere is the context:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/artur-kiulian_whitehouse-coronavirus-activity-6646040949627715584-x_k4/\n    \nMy intent is to organize a global team of multidisciplinary talent that is willing to help.\n\n## 2. CoronaWhy  <a id=\"coronawhy\"></a>\n[CoronaWhy](httsp://www.coronawhy.org) is an international group of 200+ volunteers whose mission is to improve global coordination and analysis of all available data pertinent to the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure all findings reach those who need them. \n\nThe team organically formed around Kaggle’s CORD-19 challenge, whose 10 key tasks seek to find answers to 10 of the most pressing issues surrounding the pandemic. \n\nIn the few days since Artur Kiulian started the CoronaWhy the group has grown rapidly. With 250+ volunteers from a wide range of countries, disciplines, availability and levels of expertise we’re in the process of bootstrapping our organizational procedures, protocols, communications channels and research methodologies. \n\n\n\n## 2. Current challenges <a id=\"current_challenges\"></a>\n- Understanding main challenge that is posted on kaggle, specific tasks and goals\n- Establishing efficient and effective communication and collaboration\n- Establishing diverse multidisciplinary team to tackle the ongoing corona crisis\n\n### 2.1 The competition is vague, isn't it? <a id=\"dataset_bad\"></a>\n\nTasks are very abstract but they make sense if you dig into it, the assumption is that we can create a knowledge base that can help people who have have an idea what to do to move faster, that's it. Obviously we are not genetics or protein folding experts, but we can help those people with specific domain knowledge to make progress faster by adding them to parse the dataset faster.\n\nAnd yes, if you think that the whole challenge is confusing, you are not alone - and that's expected.\t\n\nThis is NOT a challenge to fit the curve and predict some output and we are not trying to transform it into that at this point. And maybe we will find specific classic ML prediction tasks, like for risk factor modeling for example. But we are not there yet. My guess is we are a week away from it so let's try to reach that phase together.\n\nIf you currently looking for pure ML challenge, you can look into doing Covid-19 Forecasting challenge. And check \"#pure-ml-tasks\" channel on our slack\t\n\n\n## 3. Current progress <a id=\"current_progress\"></a>\nIt’s very hard to take the current challenge and transform it into traditional ML problem to be solved by community\n\n![current issues](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KDEHn7U2ue8631V1usYbYGhiiOv6VIZl)\n\nBut we can’t take all of the tasks and try to figure that out all at once, that’s why we have to figure out a way to score current scope of work against the feasibility of what we can do as a team. That’s why I came up with a 5 feature scoring structure to score current tasks:\n\n### Impact\n- 1 - small impact\n- 2 - moderate impact\n- 3 - really relevant \n- 4 - large impact\n- 5 - extremely impactful right now\n\n### Data presence\n- 1 - no meaningful datasets\n- 2 - some datasets available\n- 3 - some relevant datasets \n- 4 - pretty good relevant datasets\n- 5 - lots of context specific data\n\n### Similar solutions\n- 1 - nothing similar have been explored with ML techniques before\n- 2 - some similar research exists\n- 3 - some similar problems have been solved\n- 4 - very good coverage of similar problems and solutions\n- 5 - very similar solutions have been well researched and solved\n\n### Specificity\n- 1 - very abstract\n- 2 - somewhat defined\n- 3 - well defined\n- 4 - very clearly defined \n- 5 - obvious task\n\n### Simplicity\n- 1 - impossible to solve\n- 2 - super complex\n- 3 - complex\n- 4 - somewhat easy\n- 5 - super easy\n\nEssentially this gives us a meaningful compound metric to take and analyze against specific tasks. And after we get averages we can take top 3 of the tasks and highlight them.\n\n\n![current issues](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xP5I2wyI9KYEBOHstp5RBMSVwkIYN-qJ)\n\nExample of my (Artur’s) scoring and picking top 3 tasks above.\n\nThe goal is to crowdsource subjective reasoning about the tasks and then jump into solving them.\n\nCurrent scoring tabs here (we do understand it won't work when 100 people will join us, if someone has a better idea how to streamline this process pls let us know)\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AhDif1UUVFJAQjYM8UcbKSPXUFe0hRXfFnMkcdw3YmI/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nWe are currently trying to hit 20 people to full score the tasks, video instruction added here:\nhttps://trello.com/c/IttahQGQ/1-task-scoring-sheet\n\n\n## 4. Current scope of work <a id=\"current_scope\"></a>\n\n\n### Step 1\nScore and identify tasks worth pursuing through five features that have 1-5 score (see notes of each column)\n\n\n### Step 2\npick top 3 tasks and discuss possible ways to solve them\n\n\n### Step 3\nbasic similarity between tasks and current dataset\n\nStep 3 is a result of Artur & Anton deciding to try and lay out some knowledge foundation for people jumping into this, since there is NONE right now. Even a basic bag of words between task and dataset would help. Here is a problem description document (seems like there is a new notebook solving this, investigating it now)\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1Cbnbcj6uQkZDXzNP7dS5CUgbhvey8jSUiWU4BVTJU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAdrii & Platon are trying to provide some results on this particular task.\n\n\nUPDATE: We've successfully hit 20 people and formulated the final score. \n#### Click here: \n[Task Selection Results (Important update from March 23, 2020](#task-selection-results)\n\n\n## 5. Join Us <a id=\"join\"></a>\n\nCurrent scope of synchronous communication is becoming hard to handle, that’s why Artur committed to creating slack channel to streamline async communication.\n\nSlack has been created, please fill out \"join\" form on our website:\nhttps://www.coronawhy.org/\n\nThank you.\n\n\n## 6. Trello board - Managing Work <a id=\"trello\"></a>\nCreated initial structure for trello board\nhttps://trello.com/b/y4odX7yZ/covid-19-global-team\n\nEach task is going through the \"Rough idea\" -> \"Brainstorming\" -> \"Formalized problem\" -> \"To Do\" -> \"Doing\" -> \"Done\"\n\nEach task that goes into \"To Do\" has a capability to create separate slack channel by \"+createchannel\" comment which is a Zapier integration:\n\n![zapier task](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KPoD97KLz8UNhsexILZz7qI-ZMBZX0oW)\n\nI think the key problem we are going to face is commitment and expectations management, obviously this is not a full time job or 9-5 job, so just need to be explicit about what everyone is doing and what everyone will plan to do so everyone is on the same page, this will look weird at first but I think saying smth like\n\"I will do X piece for this task and plan to do it by Y\" and we can use trello tasks with due dates and members that go into checklist of the main task, I've done it like that on other non-profit projects that require collaboration.\n\n\n\n**Example of communication from #basic-similarity-between-tasks-and-current-dataset**\n\n***\n\n\n*Artur Kiulian  3:40 PM*\n\nhey guys\n\nhere's what Platon sent me on this task\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z03bkuWuIbKkc5Q4hGhKdw5MX8LqZSgY/view?usp=sharing\n\nHere is the notebook\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QTvtDxU9KrmcaahKMSAA5_BEC1-L1Gfj?usp=sharing\n\nHere is the data result\n\ncovid_data/covid_w2v_searchable.csv is similarity scoring for all docs for all tasks\n\n@Adrià if you have time to explore - pls check\n\n***\n\n\n*Adrià 3:41 PM*\n\nYes, im going to explore.
