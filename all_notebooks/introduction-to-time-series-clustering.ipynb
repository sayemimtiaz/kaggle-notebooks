What is clustering ?\n\n   Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning problem and the main idea is finding similarities between different data points and pair them under the same group in a way that those data points in the same group (cluster) are more like each other than to those in other groups. It is one of the main tasks of exploratory data mining and used in many fields such as bioinformatics, pattern recognition, image analysis, machine learning, etc.\n    \n![Clustering algorithms benchmark](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_cluster_comparison_0011.png) \n<center>Source : scikit-learn Documentation: <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_cluster_comparison_0011.png\">sphx_glr_plot_cluster_comparison_0011.png</a></center>\n    \n## 1. 2. What are time series ?\n    \n   Time series are a stream of data that are created by making measures of something such as sales, temperature, stocks, etc. in fixed frequency. They have to be indexed in time order and usually used in weather forecasting, econometrics, earthquake prediction, signal processing, etc.\n    \n![Time series example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Random-data-plus-trend-r2.png)\n<center>Source : Wiki Commons: <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Random-data-plus-trend-r2.png\">Random-data-plus-trend-r2.png</a></center>\n\n# 2.
