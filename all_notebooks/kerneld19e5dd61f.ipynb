The output is dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is one way of testing AI.\n\nUnsupervised learning algorithms can perform more complex processing tasks than supervised learning systems. However, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable than the alternate model. While an unsupervised learning AI system might, for example, figure out on its own how to sort cats from dogs, it might also add unforeseen and undesired categories to deal with unusual breeds, creating clutter instead of order."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Clustering"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them.\n\nFor Ex: The data points in the graph below clustered together can be classified into one single group. We can distinguish the clusters, and we can identify that there are 3 clusters in the below picture.\n\nSome commonly used clustering algorithms:\n1. K means\n2. DBSCAN\n3. Mean-Shift \n4.

The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.\n\n![Image](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2016/12/kmeans.gif)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Working of K means\n\nThe Κ-means clustering algorithm uses iterative refinement to produce a final result. The algorithm inputs are the number of clusters Κ and the data set. The data set is a collection of features for each data point. The algorithms starts with initial estimates for the Κ centroids, which can either be randomly generated or randomly selected from the data set. The algorithm then iterates between two steps:\n\n1. Data assigment step:\n\nEach centroid defines one of the clusters. In this step, each data point is assigned to its nearest centroid, based on the squared Euclidean distance. More formally, if ci is the collection of centroids in set C, then each data point x is assigned to a cluster based on\n\n$$\\underset{c_i \\in C}{\\arg\\min} \\; dist(c_i,x)^2$$\n\nwhere dist( · ) is the standard (L2) Euclidean distance. Let the set of data point assignments for each ith cluster centroid be Si.\n\n2. Centroid update step:\n\nIn this step, the centroids are recomputed. This is done by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that centroid's cluster.\n\n$$c_i=\\frac{1}{|S_i|}\\sum_{x_i \\in S_i x_i}$$\n\nThe algorithm iterates between steps one and two until a stopping criteria is met (i.e., no data points change clusters, the sum of the distances is minimized, or some maximum number of iterations is reached).\n\nThis algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a result. The result may be a local optimum (i.e. not necessarily the best possible outcome), meaning that assessing more than one run of the algorithm with randomized starting centroids may give a better outcome.\n\nChoosing K\nThe algorithm described above finds the clusters and data set labels for a particular pre-chosen K. To find the number of clusters in the data, the user needs to run the K-means clustering algorithm for a range of K values and compare the results. In general, there is no method for determining exact value of K, but an accurate estimate can be obtained using the following techniques.\n\nOne of the metrics that is commonly used to compare results across different values of K is the mean distance between data points and their cluster centroid. Since increasing the number of clusters will always reduce the distance to data points, increasing K will always decrease this metric, to the extreme of reaching zero when K is the same as the number of data points. Thus, this metric cannot be used as the sole target. Instead, mean distance to the centroid as a function of K is plotted and the \"elbow point,\" where the rate of decrease sharply shifts, can be used to roughly determine K.\n\nA number of other techniques exist for validating K, including cross-validation, information criteria, the information theoretic jump method, the silhouette method, and the G-means algorithm. In addition, monitoring the distribution of data points across groups provides insight into how the algorithm is splitting the data for each K.\n\n![Image](https://media.giphy.com/media/42dsvcMDP3diU/giphy.gif)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Problem Statement\n\nThe data provider @arjunbhasin2013 says: \n> This case requires to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy.

They make large payments, but this appears to be a small group of customers.\n* **Medium Spenders with third highest Payments **- the second highest Purchases group (after the Big Spenders).\n* **Highest Credit Limit but Frugal** - this group doesn't make a lot of purchases.
