We use the matplotlib *subplot* tool to line up the individual plots in a grid. We use overlapping histograms for ordinal features and barplots for categorical features. The barplots show the fraction of people (per group) who survived. There's a lot going on in this figure, so take your time to look at all the details.\n\n**We learn** the following things from studying the individual features:\n\n- *Age:* The medians are identical. However, it's noticeable that fewer young adults have survived (ages 18 - 30-ish) whereas **children younger than 10-ish had a better survival rate.** Also, there are no obvious outliers that would indicate problematic input data. The highest ages are well consistent with the overall distribution. There is a notable shortage of teenagers compared to the crowd of younger kids. But this could have natural reasons.\n\n- *Pclass:* There's a clear trend that **being a 1st class passenger gives you better chances of survival**. Life just isn't fair.\n\n- *SibSp & Parch:* **Having 1-3 siblings/spouses/parents/children on board (SibSp = 1-2, Parch = 1-3) suggests proportionally better survival numbers than being alone (SibSp + Parch = 0) or having a large family travelling with you.**\n\n- *Embarked:* Well, that does look more interesting than expected.  **Embarking at \"C\" resulted in a higher survival rate than embarking at \"S\"**. There might be a correlation with other variables, here though.\n\n- *Fare:* This is case where a linear scaling isn't of much help because there is a smaller number of more extreme numbers. A natural choice in this case is to transform the values logarithmically. For this to work we need to adjust for the zero-fare entries.  The plot tells us that the **survival chances were much lower for the cheaper cabins**.

Each tree is a series of if-then-else decisions. Example: *if* sex ==  male *then* go left *else* go right. Here, *left* and *right* defines a split at a so called *node* - the decision itself. The first split can be followed up by additional ones to narrow down the decision criteria (based on the subset defined by each previous split).\n\nOne visualisation of this process is a tree trunk *branching off* into successively smaller structures. Hence: decision *tree*. Consequently, the result of the final splits are called *leaf notes* - on a tree, it doesn't get smaller than leafs.\n\nAdvantages of decision trees are that they can deal with both numerical and categorical data, are able to handle multi-output problems, and are easy to follow and interpret.\n\nDisadvantages include:\n\n- Problem: A tendency to overfitting. Solution: pruning, setting maximum depth, or PCA beforehand to find the right number of features. Visualising the tree helps to understand how well it is fitting the data.\n\n- Problem: Unstable to small variations in the data. Solution: ensembles.\n\n- Problem: Creating biased trees if some classes dominate. Solution: balance the data set by either sampling the same number of samples from each class or by adjusting the *sample_weight* parameter to normalise the sum of the class weights to the same value. Following that, parameter *min_weight_fraction_leaf* is less biased towards dominating classes.\n\n- Problem: Being just not easy to fit to certain concepts that don't lend themselves to clear yes-or-no decisions.

Similar to the standard error of the mean for sampling normal distributions.\n\nThere are two types of ensemble methods: *boosting*, used below, and *averaging* (or *bagging*; see above). A random forest is an averaging classifier for which we train several estimators independently and then average over their individual predictions. Boosting works best for weak learners (e.g. decision stumps) whereas for Bagging/Averaging to be successful we want to overfit a little\n\nThe *random* in *random forest* comes from the method of training each tree using a random bootstrap sample (i.e. one with replacement) of the original training set. Further randomness is introduced by making the node split dependent on a random subset of features instead of all of them. Here single trees are combined through the average of the prediction probabilities.\n\nIn addition to the tree parameters, the most important settings are:\n\n- n_estimators: number of trees. The larger the better, although improvements become marginal eventually\n\n- max_features: number of random features per subset. Lower numbers decrease variance and increase bias.

An additional randomness is introduced by selecting random thresholds for each feature and using the best-performing threshold.\n\nHere we also use an \"Out-of-bag score\" (*oob\\_score = True*). This means that we grow our trees from a sub-sample of the training sample (using bootstrapping: *boostrap = True*) and estimate the accuracy based on those entries that were not picked (i.e. \"left out of the bag\"). This gives us a better impression how robust our results are towards generalisation, i.e. how well the classifier that was trained on a particular sample can be applied to new data. \n\nBecause this is ultimately our goal: to apply the classification method we \"learn\" from the training data to any data (in particular the one that is used to judge this competition). There is little use in having a classifier that replicates perfectly the training data by following every random noise feature in that data (called *overfitting*) but doesn't perform well with new data.\n\nThe principles of *bootstrapping* and the *out-of-bag score* can be applied to most classifiers and we already used them in the *bagging* classifier above.

This tree can now consider the full number of training samples for splitting a node at another feature, instead of having to deal with the decreased sample after the first original node (and the resulting impact of random fluctuations). This can be done again and again for n_estimator number of times.\n\nThe weak classifier itself does not necessarily have to be a tree, but a tree seems to be the favourite approach to use here. Another convention is to initialise this sequence of models with a single prediction value (like the mean of the training survival values).\n\nInstead of reducing the residuals (and the corresponding squared errors) Gradient Boosting focusses on minimising the *Loss Function* by training the classifier on the *gradient* of this function. The Loss Function describes how much the prediction is improved when shifting the predicted values by a certain amount. The method of *Gradient Decent* uses this Loss Function to iteratively move into the direction of its greatest decent (i.e. most negative first derivative). The step sizes can vary from iteration to iteration.\n\nAn additional concept is *Shrinkage*. Here, the size of each step multiplied by a factor (0,1]. In the model parameters, this factor is called the *learning_rate*. Lower learning rates make for a slower decent which seems to be empirically more effective. \n\nOne more step is to provide a sampling of rows and features, like in the random forest discussed above, to increase the diversity in tree splits and thereby a larger amount of information for the method to work with.\n\nThe important parameters are:\n\n- n_estimators: number of boosting stages; more is better\n\n- learning_rate: smaller steps need more stages\n\n- max_depth: tune for best performance; depends on interaction of features\n\n- subsample: only train on a sub sample of the data set drawn without replacement.
