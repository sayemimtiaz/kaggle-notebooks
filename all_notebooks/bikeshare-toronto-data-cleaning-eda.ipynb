I will be using the BikeShare Toronto data set and hourly weather data gathered from Environment Canada, between the dates of 2017-01-01 to 2020-12-31.\n\n**Background**<br>\nBikeShare Toronto is a bike-share program that features more than 6,850 bicycles and 625 docking stations across 200sqkm of the city. BikeShare Toronto provides a flexible and cost-effective way to navigate Toronto with their traditional bikes and e-bikes. Both options cost the same rate at \\$3.25 per trip and the service offers short-term pass options (Single Day (24 hours), or 3 Day (72 Hours)) as well as long-term memberships (Annual 30 (30min rides), or Annual 45 (45min rides)).\n\n**Objective**<br>\nThe objective of my Capstone Project is to answer the *Business Case Question* of:\n\n**<center>Accurately predict bike usage numbers based on past usage patterns</center>**\n\nThe ability to predict usage levels are beneficial to many industries in terms of strategic planning and logistics where you can plan and adjust inventory and distribution across the system accordingly so that you can maximize efficiency and revenue generation.\n\n**Purpose**<br>\nThe purpose of this notebook is to consolidate the downloaded BikeShare Toronto data and hourly weather data into a single dataframe, then conducting an exploratory data analysis, and produce some visualizations that we can gain some insights on **HOW** riders use the bikeshare service. Then we will export the cleaned data set to use in Part 2 to create a machine learning model to answer our *Business Case Question*.\n\n**Data Sources**<br>\nThe data is to be gathered is from the following sources:\n\n1. [City of Toronto: Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/): City of Toronto has an open data catalogue where I obtained Toronto BikeShare trip datasets from 2017 to 2020. This will be the main source of trip data that will be analyzed.\n\n2. [CKAN](https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/en/dataset/bike-share-toronto): CKAN is an open-source data portal platform where I obtained the links to the Toronto BikeShare API to request up-to-date data regarding BikeShare station information. I will be querying the API for any more useful information that can help with my objective.\n\n3. [Government of Canada](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html): Government of Canada has a catalogue of historical weather data throughout various weather stations across Canada. Weather affects bike usage, where incliment weather causes people to ride bikes less.\n\nAside from the data I am gathering above, I will also add in calendar information such as weekends and holidays as it may have an affect the number of riders will use the bike share service.\n\n**Next Steps**<br>\nAfter loading in the data sets, I will be checking the data and then cleaning it by imputation and/or removing any null values then combining the datasets together as my main working dataset.\n\nIf you wish to follow along, you will need to create a new conda environment by using the package list included in the zip folder by running the script below.\n\n```bash\nconda create -n jho_capstone_env --file jho_capstone_env.txt\n```\nYou may change jho_capstone_env to any name you prefer.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Timer\nfrom tqdm import tqdm \nimport time\n\n# global settings\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None) #Set max columns view to unlimited","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-01T22:21:39.642107Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-01T22:21:39.642399Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-01T22:21:40.052372Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-01T22:21:39.642336Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-01T22:21:40.051673Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of Contents\n[Section 1: Loading and Inspecting the Data](#Section-1:-Loading-and-Inspecting-the-Data)<br>\n- [Part 1: Trips Datasets](#Part-1:-Trips-Datasets)\n\n- [Part 2: Weather Datasets](#Part-2:-Weather-Datasets)\n\n[Section 2: Data Wrangling](#Section-2:-Data-Wrangling)<br>\n- [Part 1: Trip Datasets](#Part-1:-Trip-Datasets)\n\n- [Part 2: Weather Datasets](#Part-2:-Weather-Datasets)\n\n- [Part 3: Loading API Datasets](#Part-3:-Loading-API-Datasets)\n\n- [Part 4: Creating Master Dataframe](#Part-4:-Creating-Master-Dataframe)\n\n[Section 3: Exploratory Data Analysis](#Section-3:-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)<br>\n- [Histograms](#Histograms)<br>\n- [Time Scale Graphs](#Time-Scale-Graphs)<br>\n\n[Section 4: Conclusions](#Section-4:-Conclusions)<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## Step 1: Loading and Inspecting the Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Condense below load data code into loops.\n# [Code Source](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/14-looping-data-sets/)\n\n# `for filename in glob.glob('data/gapminder_*.csv'):\n#     data = pd.read_csv(filename)`","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-01T22:21:40.053368Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-01T22:21:40.053758Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-01T22:21:40.056238Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-01T22:21:40.05373Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-01T22:21:40.055636Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Part 1: Trip Data\n#### **2017 & 2018 Trip Data**\n**_About the Data_**\n\nThe 2017 trip dataset contains 1,492,369 bike trip data taken between more than 600 stations across the City of Toronto.

Therefore we will be replacing all `null` values with the max value of 16.1\n- `Hmdx` & `Wind Chill` impute 0 for `null` as they are no longer measured in cold/hot weather respectively\n- `Weather` has multiple weather observations that can be broken down into boolean classifier using `CountVectorizer` to create sparse (boolean) matrix \n\n**Next Steps**<br>\n1.

The description of each feature is listed below:\n\n- `station_id`: Unique Station ID\n- `name`: Name of Bike Station\n- `physical_configuration`: Type of Bike Station\n- `lat`: Latitude coordinates of Bike Station\n- `lon`: Longitude coordinates of Bike Station\n- `address`: Address of where the Bike Station is located\n- `capacity`: Max number of bikes the station can accommodate\n- `rental_methods`: Payment Methods Available\n- `groups`: Bike Station Group ID\n- `obcn`: On-board Communication Number, the unique phone number at which the station communicates remotely\n- `nearby_distance`: Based on heading, it is the distance nearby some unknown reference point\n- `post_code`: Postal Code of where the Bike Station is located\n- `cross_street`: Based on heading, it may be the intersection at which the Bikestation is located\n\nOut of the features listed above, we are only interested in `station_id`, `name`, `lat`, `lon`, `capacity` `post_code` as these can help us identify the locations of the stations and their corresponding capacity currently.

Section 4: Conclusions\n\n#### Observations & Trends\nJust to reinterate the observations and trends from before:\n- Trips have been on the upward trend over the years with the 2020 having the most weekly variation compared to previous years.\n- There is also a clear seasonality each year where the most rides happen in the heart of summer and least rides in the winter months. \n-  Station usage pattern have been relatively consistant the previous 3 years where the top 5 start and stop stations have been a mix of downtown stations and harbourfront where in 2020 all the top start and stop stations are along the harbourfront.\n- Most of thr rides happen at the lower range of elevation between 80-100m, indicating this to be places closer to the water.\n- Most common trips are taken from stations with capacity around 20 bikes then 15 bikes and thirdly 10 bikes.\n- Most common temperature at the start of trip is around 18-25°C which can indicate that is the most ideal temperature bike users prefer to take trips.\n- Most common relative humidity at the start of trip is between 60% to 80% which can indicate that is the most ideal relative humidity bike users prefer to take trips.\n- Most trips happen outside of weather events with rain being the most common if there were to be a ride when a weather event is occurring.\n- The top 5 most active FSA neighbourhoods are all downtown areas with M5V being the most active and also most dense in population as well as encompassing a number of tourist attractions.\n\n#### Suggestions\n- While 2020 was an atypical year from others there is a clear trend for higher weekend usage and that was amplified in 2020 and could well continue into the 2021 as people get more used to the service as tourism ramps back up.\n\n#### Next Steps\n- Complete Machine Learning Models, Time Series Analysis, and Network Analysis in subsequent notebooks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
