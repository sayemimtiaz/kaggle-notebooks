All carbohydrate foods are broken down into glucose in the blood. Insulin helps glucose get into the cells. \n\nNot being able to produce insulin or use it effectively leads to raised glucose levels in the blood (known as hyperglycaemia). Over the long-term high glucose levels are associated with damage to the body and failure of various organs and tissues.\n\n\nTypes of diabetes\nThere are three main types of diabetes – type 1, type 2 and gestational.\n\n1. Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but occurs most frequently in children and adolescents. When you have type 1 diabetes, your body produces very little or no insulin, which means that you need daily insulin injections to maintain blood glucose levels under control. Learn more.\n2. Type 2 diabetes is more common in adults and accounts for around 90% of all diabetes cases. When you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make good use of the insulin that it produces. The cornerstone of type 2 diabetes treatment is healthy lifestyle, including increased physical activity and healthy diet. However, over time most people with type 2 diabetes will require oral drugs and/or insulin to keep their blood glucose levels under control. Learn more.\n3. Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that consists of high blood glucose during pregnancy and is associated with complications to both mother and child. GDM usually disappears after pregnancy but women affected and their children are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life\n\nSource Information :https://www.idf.org/aboutdiabetes/what-is-diabetes.html","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.018693,"end_time":"2020-08-22T05:07:58.081063","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-22T05:07:58.06237","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this study, we tried to classifying diabetes using 6 different algorithms:\n1.

This technique uses the logistic function or sigmoid function, which is an S-shaped curve that can assume any real value number and assign it to a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly in those limits. Thus, logistic regression models the probability of the default class (the probability that an input $(X)$ belongs to the default class $(Y=1)$) $(P(X)=P(Y=1|X))$. In order to make the prediction of the probability, the logistic function is used, which allows us to obtain the log-odds or the probit. Thus, the model is a linear combination of the inputs, but that this linear combination relates to the log-odds of the default class.\n\nStarted from make an instance of the model setting the default values.

SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification\n\nSVMs (Support Vector Machine) have shown a rapid proliferation during the last years. The learning problem setting for SVMs corresponds to a some unknown and nonlinear dependency (mapping, function) $y = f(x)$ between some high-dimensional input vector $x$ and scalar output $y$. It is noteworthy that there is no information on the joint probability functions, therefore, a free distribution learning must be carried out. The only information available is a training data set $D = {(x_i, y_i) ∈ X×Y }, i = 1$, $l$, where $l$ stands for the number of the training data pairs and is therefore equal to the size of the training data set $D$, additionally, $y_i$ is denoted as $d_i$, where $d$ stands for a desired (target) value.

Decision tree classification\n\nA decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The decision tree analyzes a set of data to construct a set of rules or questions, which are used to predict a class, i.e., the goal of decision tree is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. In this sense the decision tree selects the best attribute using to divide the records, converting that attribute into a decision node and dividing the data set into smaller subsets, to finally start the construction of the tree repeating this process recursively.

Random forest classification\n\nBased on the previous classification method, random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that creates a forest randomly. This forest, is a set of decision trees, most of the times trained with the bagging method. The essential idea of bagging is to average many noisy but approximately impartial models, and therefore reduce the variation. Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:\n\n* Let $N$ be the number of test cases, $M$ is the number of variables in the classifier.\n* Let $m$ be the number of input variables to be used to determine the decision in a given node; $m<M$.\n* Choose a training set for this tree and use the rest of the test cases to estimate the error.\n* For each node of the tree, randomly choose $m$ variables on which to base the decision. Calculate the best partition of the training set from the $m$ variables.\n\nFor prediction a new case is pushed down the tree. Then it is assigned the label of the terminal node where it ends. This process is iterated by all the trees in the assembly, and the label that gets the most incidents is reported as the prediction. We define the number of trees in the forest in 100.
