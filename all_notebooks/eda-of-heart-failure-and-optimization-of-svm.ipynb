Data exploration\n    - Principle Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of features to have a view of the input data distribution\n    - Build a preliminary linear SVM model to incorporate all the features to see the model performance.\n2. Feature selection part.\n    - Chi-square test to check the correlation between each categorical feature and the target death event.\n    - Heat map to return the features with high correlation coefficient with death events.\n    - Visualized the each feature's contribution significance in the SVM model\n    - Compared the returned features and determined the final selected features\n3. Model comparison and hyperparameter tuning\n    - compare the performance in difference preprocessing methods MinMaxScalar, StandardScalar, RobustScalar\n    - compare the performance in k-fold cross validation and leave-one-out methods\n    - compare the kernel selected in Support Vector Machine (linear or rbf)\n    - grid search to find the best performance model\n4. Selected model performance\n    - calculated the precision, recall, accuracy and f1-score\n    - plot the ROC and PR-curve\n    - plot the learning curve\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Related work\n\n### Explorative data analysis (EDA) approach\n\n1. [heart-fail-analysis-and-quick-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/nayansakhiya/heart-fail-analysis-and-quick-prediction)\n\n**Strength**: Detailed explorative and associative data analysis with great data visualization: each factor is visualized by different types of figures <br>\n**Weakness**: Prediction model are quite rudimentary, the author did not select the features and tune the models' hyperparameters.<br>\n**Similarity**: I learned and applied the plotly.express API to create fancy and concise figures for easy comparison; I furthered his rudimentary model by optimization\n\n### Predictive data analysis (PDA) approach\n\n1. [heart-failure-model-prediction-comparisons-95](https://www.kaggle.com/rude009/heart-failure-model-prediction-comparisons-95)\n\n**Strength**: The author compares six prediction models with feature selection. The Extra Gradient Booster Classifier could achieve the accuracy up to 95.0% <br>\n**Weakness**: The author consider the \"time\" column as the useful features. <br>\n**Similarity**: I don't think \"time\" colume should be included since \"time\" column stands for Follow-up period (days), which means itself could not contribute the diseases itself. Therefore, I consider this feature as uselessness in our prediction model\n\n2. [heart-failure-prediction-auc-0-98](https://www.kaggle.com/ksvmuralidhar/heart-failure-prediction-auc-0-98)\n\n**Strength**: The author uses a new method: Chi-square test to find the correlation between single categorical feature with target death_event <br>\n**Weakness**: The visualization part does not as fancy as previous work <br>\n**Similarity**: I learned and used the Chi-square test to conduct the correlation test between single categorical data with the categorical death_event; but i didn't agree the author's method in using box plot comparison between numerical data with categorical data, I used heat map instead."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---"},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem formulation"},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Return the head of dataset (a overview of inside components)"},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n# df = pd.read_csv(\"/home/yuxuan/kaggle/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\")\n# df = pd.read_csv(\"/Users/yuxuan/Desktop/kaggle/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\")\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/heart-failure-clinical-data/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\")\nheart_data = df.copy()\nheart_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"is_executing":true,"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Print the size of the dataset"},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(heart_data.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Check the ratio of the NaNs for each column"},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"for col in heart_data.columns:\n    print(col, str(round(100* heart_data[col].isnull().sum() / len(heart_data), 2)) + '%')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n### Dataset description\nThere are 13 dimensions and 299 samples.

I firstly conducted a preliminary analysis of the whole dataset and utilized the PCA method to visualize the distribution condition of the samples. The initial analysis was not robust and precise, which required me to optimize the model. Then, I conducted feature selection to return the top 4 most correlated feature with the death event. Apart from that, I also compared the difference between normalization method as well as the validation methods. The final determined methods were to use four selected features ('serum_creatinine','age','ejection_fraction', 'creatinine_phosphokinase'), StandardScalar methods and ten-fold cross validation to conduct the prediction. In addition, I also conduct the explorative data analysis to have a view of the selected feature. Furthermore, the PCA condition after feature selection still could not determine whether the dataset is linearly seperable or not, I, therefore, used the grid serach to return the most suitable hyperparameters. The final results suggested that the SVM with RBF kernel in gamma equals 0.1 and penalty C equals 1 could achieve the best performance. After that, the model performance was evaluated from confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score. Moreover, the ROC plot and PR-curve plot with AUC and AP accordingly were indicated. The final accuracy could achieve 0.83, which is satisfactory. \n\nIn the future, since this project only used SVM related algorithms, I would like to incorporate more complicate algorithms, for instance, XGboost. Furthermore, the model's interpretability are not great enough, and that would be my focus in the future.
