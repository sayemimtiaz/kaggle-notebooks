It is one of the easiest machine learning techniques used. It is a lazy learning model with a local approach.\n\n## Basic Theory\nThe basic logic behind KNN is to discover what's around it, assume the test data point is similar to them, and derive the output. In KNN, we seek neighbors and come with foresight.\n\nIn the case of KNN classification, the majority vote is applied to the nearest k data points, while in the KNN regression, the average of the nearest k data points is calculated as output. As a general rule, we choose the odd numbers as k. KNN is a lazy learning model in which calculations occur only at run time. While majority voting is applied over the nearest k data points, in KNN regression, the average of the nearest k data points is calculated as output. As a general rule, we choose the odd numbers as k. KNN is a lazy learning model in which calculations occur only at run time.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CMtFYSX/Ek-A-klama-2020-08-28-000822.jpg)\n\nYellow and purple dots in the above diagram correspond to Class A and Class B in the education data. The red star indicates test data that should be classified. When k = 3, we predict Class B as output, and when K = 6, Class A as output.\n\n## Lost Function\nThere is no training on KNN. During the test, the minimum distance k neighbor will be included in the classification / regression.\n\n## Advantages\n- Easy and simple machine learning model.\n- Few hyperparameters to adjust.\n\n## Disadvantages\n- The value of k should be chosen wisely.\n- High calculation cost over the run time if the sample size is large.\n- Appropriate scaling should be provided for fair treatment across features.\n\n## Hyperparameters\n- KNN mainly includes two hyperparameters, K value and distance function.\n- K value:\n    - How many neighbors will join the KNN algorithm. k should be set according to the authentication error.\n- Distance function:\n    - Euclidean distance is the most used similarity function. Manhattan distance, Hamming Distance, Minkowski distance are different alternatives.\n\n## Assumptions\n- There should be a clear requirement about the input area.\n- Moderate sample size as appropriate (due to space and time constraints).\n- Collinearity and outliers should be addressed before training.\n\n## Comparison with Other Models\n- A general difference between KNN and other models is the large real-time computing KNN needs compared to others.\n\n\n### KNN vs Naive Bayes\n- Naive bayes is much faster than KNN due to the real time implementation of KNN.\n- While naive bayes are parametric, KNN is not parametric.\n\n### KNN vs SVM\n- SVM handles outliers better than KNN.\n- SVM performs better than KNN when there are large features and less training data.\n\n### KNN vs Neural Networks (NN)\n- Neural networks require larger training data compared to KNN to achieve sufficient accuracy.\n- NN needs a lot of hyperparameter settings compared to KNN.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Coding
