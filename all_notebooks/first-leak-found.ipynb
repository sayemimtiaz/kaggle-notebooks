This probably is the easiest leak, as it was found first also in a workshop using this data.\n\nSo, where to start looking for some hidden information? We can see from feature importance plot in [\"First look at data and baseline model\"](https://www.kaggle.com/alijs1/first-look-at-data-and-baseline-model) kernel, that the biggest gain for model is obtained from **col8** feature. Let's start with this one and see if we can find something interesting.\n\nFrom [\"First look at data and baseline model\"](https://www.kaggle.com/alijs1/first-look-at-data-and-baseline-model) kernel we also already know that this feature has integer values and it's distribution visually looks very similar to Normal distribution with the mean at about 100.\n\nLet's check the most frequent values of this feature:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\ndf_train = pd.read_csv('../input/artificial-data-leaks/train.csv')\ndf_test = pd.read_csv('../input/artificial-data-leaks/test.csv')\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Value': df_train['col8'].value_counts().index,\n                  'Count in train': df_train['col8'].value_counts()})\ndf['Count in test'] = df_test['col8'].value_counts()\ndf = df.fillna(0).astype(int)\ndf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Not surprisingly the most frequent values are all close to the mean value of 100.\n\nAs this feature is considered very important by our model, it would be interesting to find out, what exactly model sees in it.
