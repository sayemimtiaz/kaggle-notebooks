We also look at the number of labels per class for each airline. We see that the sentiment varies for every airline. Because of this, it is necessary to implement a regular expression to replace the airline name in every tweet. We don't want our machine to use 'airline name' as a means to predict the sentiment.\n\n2) Language Model Fine Tuning: First, we import a pretrained language model. For this project, we used the wikitext103 language model. We then fine tune it a bit for our particular problem by training it on our Twitter dataset. \n\n3) Classifier Fine Tuning: Currently, we have a language model that is fairly decent at predicting the next word in a sentence. But it cannot yet perform sentiment analysis. So, we train the language model to be a classifier using tweets and associated labels of \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" also provided to us in the dataset.\n\n4) Results: In this last step, we analyze the performance of our classifier. It can predict the sentiment of the tweets at an 82.7 percent accuracy which is fairly decent at face value. Tweets can be somewhat ambiguous and things like sarcasm are difficult to account for. The misclassified tweets are observed and it seems that it is diffiuclt to distinguish between positive and neutral tweets.

The method performed exceptionally well achieving a ~81 percent accuracy. \n\nThe above table shows the misclassified positive tweets as negative. Although our method is very accurate - moreso than other methods, we still want to understand better why we got these predictions wrong. \n\nIt is still unclear. But some of the tweets do carry negative sentiment aimed at other users instead of the particular airline. In addition, there are other things to consider with informal writing such as sarcasm. Finally, \nthere do appear to be tweets that are mislabeled in the dataset. Perhaps the sentiment judgment is a bit subjective. But take for example the tweet in the table above: \"@airline # epicfail on connections in # xxmaj chicago today , extremely disappointed w / xxunk customer service , rethinking loyalty 😐.\" This tweet is labeled neutral in the dataset. However, our model predicted it to be negative. I agree more with the model's prediction for this tweet than the label it came with. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
