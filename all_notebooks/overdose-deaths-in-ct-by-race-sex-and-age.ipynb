The “average” case is a 39.7-year-old white male who overdosed on heroin. Black and Hispanic overdose victims are predicted to live 5.1 and 1.6 years longer than white victims, respectively, while victims of other races are predicted to live 1.6 years fewer than their white counterparts. Victims who test positive for Hydromorphone are perhaps the \"best off\" of all the other drugs, and are predicted to live nearly 7 years longer than those who overdosed on Heroin. \n\nThe following drugs are all also significant and positively associated with age relative to Heroin: \n- Tramadol (6.6y older), \n- Hydrocodone (5.4y), \n- Morphine (4.3y), \n- Oxycodone (4.2y), \n- Methadone(2.7y), \n- Ethanol (2.4y), \n- Cocaine (1.7y), and \n- Benzodiazepine (1.4y). \n\nOnly two drugs that were negatively associated with age relative to heroin - Fentanyl and Amphetamines, whose victims were expected to live 2.1 and 2.5 fewer years, respectively. In determining the number of drugs in an overdose victim, race and age are significant. Black and Hispanic victims are predicted to overdose on 0.13 and 0.08 fewer drugs than white victims, respectively. Between 0-years-old and approximately 45-years-old, increased age is correlated with increase in number of drugs. The maximum indicates that a 45-year-old white male overdose victim is predicted to test positive for 2.3 drugs. From 45-years-old on, the number of drugs is predicted to decrease as age increases.\n\nBlack and Hispanic victims are predicted to overdose later in life than white victims, and Asian victims are predicted to overdose over 6 years earlier than white victims. My first attempt to explain this change in age at death was to look at [poverty rates by race](https://talkpoverty.org/state-year-report/connecticut-2018-report/), however these rates have no clear association with the change in expected age at time of death. In a similar econometric study of Connecticut’s overdose statistics, assistant professor of medicine at Yale University Dr. Daniel Tobin [offers the following explaination](https://overdose.trendct.org/story/who), “Being white or affluent doesn't protect you. In fact, in some cases it might be a risk factor. Affluent communities tend to have better access to prescription pain medications.” This explanation doesn't fit with the reported poverty rates, but several other [healthcare related disparities](https://www.cthealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Health-disparities-in-Connecticut.pdf) have been observed in Connecticut may help to explain this phenomenon - Hispanic and Black residents often have less access to insurance and regular health care provider, which could mean fewer prescription drugs circulating in these communities.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising of these results is the lack of significance of biological sex. Physically, I predicted that increased body weight could lower males’ chances of death as fatal doses of most drugs are dependent on body weight. This could be tested by including body weight of victims in future samples. Sociologically, however, I am inclined to generalize male drug users between the ages of 18 and 45 as more impulsive than their female counterparts - and therefore more likely to use more drugs at once or to use too many and overdose earlier in life. The relationship between biological sex, impulse, and drug use is [complex and well-documented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012004/), though the models I observe here have nothing concrete to contribute to these discussions.\n","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
