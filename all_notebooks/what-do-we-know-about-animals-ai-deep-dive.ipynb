The user would learn something from each search and write down new keywords, and concepts - slowly putting together a picture of **(SEE keyword above)**.  All of this information would have to be distilled down by the user into a digestable and shareable format of everything they learned about **(SEE keyword above)**.\n\n**Solution:** We propose a new approach to this problem called SOSRUS - Self-Organizing Scientific Research Understanding System.  In this notebook, we will demonstrate how the system, given just the word **(SEE keyword above)**, will analyze all the documents relating to the term **(SEE keyword above)** and create a language model to automatically understand and uncover important topics about drugs and expand on them, ultimately providing an organized and concise output that summarizies all the information about drugs into an easy to read format.\n\n**Goal:** To avoid a hand coded rules system and have the system actually learn concepts on its own starting with one word or short phrase.  The system, on its own, should expand, learn and present relevant information and supporting documents in a helpful and understandable manner for human understanding.\n\n# Step 1: Import Python packages and full-text documents:\nHere the system will import all python packages needed to create itself.  The system will also import the data from the meta CSV file into a Pandas dataframe and filter out the documents that are not relevant to COVID-19 COV-2 etc.\n\nThen the full text versions of the filtered documents will be loaded from the JSON files into the correpsonding rows of the dataframe.  If there is a full text, that is saved in the abstract column, if there is not full text version, the abstract is used for those papers.\n\nFinally in this step, the system will focus only on documents that contain the word **(SEE keyword above)**."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import spacy\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom copy import deepcopy\nimport math\nimport torch\n!pip install rake-nltk\nfrom rake_nltk import Rake\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom rake_nltk import Metric, Rake","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print ('python packages imported')\n\nfrom IPython.core.display import display, HTML\n# keep only documents with covid -cov-2 and cov2\ndef search_focus(df):\n    dfa = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('covid')]\n    dfb = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('-cov-2')]\n    dfc = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('cov2')]\n    dfd = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('ncov')]\n    frames=[dfa,dfb,dfc,dfd]\n    df = pd.concat(frames)\n    df=df.drop_duplicates(subset='title', keep=\"first\")\n    return df\n\n# load the meta data from the CSV file using 3 columns (abstract, title, authors),\ndf=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/metadata.csv', usecols=['title','journal','abstract','authors','doi','publish_time','sha','full_text_file'])\nprint ('total documents ',df.shape)\n#drop duplicates\n#df=df.drop_duplicates()\n#drop NANs \ndf=df.fillna('no data provided')\ndf = df.drop_duplicates(subset='title', keep=\"first\")\n# convert abstracts to lowercase\ndf[\"abstract\"] = df[\"abstract\"].str.lower()+df[\"title\"].str.lower()\n#show 5 lines of the new dataframe\ndf=search_focus(df)\ndf = df[df['publish_time'].str.contains('2020')]\nprint ('COVID-19 focused documents ',df.shape)\ndf.head()\n\ndef format_body(body_text):\n    texts = [(di['section'], di['text']) for di in body_text]\n    texts_di = {di['section']: \"\" for di in body_text}\n    \n    for section, text in texts:\n        texts_di[section] += text\n\n    body = \"\"\n\n    for section, text in texts_di.items():\n        body += section\n        body += \"\\n\\n\"\n        body += text\n        body += \"\\n\\n\"\n    \n    return body\n\n\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    if ';' not in row['sha'] and os.path.exists('/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'+row['full_text_file']+'/'+row['full_text_file']+'/pdf_json/'+row['sha']+'.json')==True:\n        with open('/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'+row['full_text_file']+'/'+row['full_text_file']+'/pdf_json/'+row['sha']+'.json') as json_file:\n            data = json.load(json_file)\n            body=format_body(data['body_text'])\n            keyword_list=['TB','incidence','age']\n            #print (body)\n            body=body.replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n\n            df.loc[index, 'abstract'] = body.lower()\n\ndf=df.drop(['full_text_file'], axis=1)\ndf=df.drop(['sha'], axis=1)\ndf.head()\n\n# add full text back after testing","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import functools\ndef search_focus_shape(df,focus):\n    df1 = df[df['abstract'].str.contains(focus)]\n    #df1=df[functools.reduce(lambda a, b: a&b, (df['abstract'].str.contains(s) for s in focus))]\n    return df1\n\nfocus_term='animal'\ndf1=search_focus_shape(df,focus_term)\nprint ('focus term: ',focus_term)\nprint ('# focused papers',df1.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 2: Word proximity / pseudo bi-gram language model\nIn this step, the system analyzes all the documents containing the word **(SEE keyword above)** and extracts words in close proximity.
