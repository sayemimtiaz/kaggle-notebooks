Since we are still in the first stages of this analytics challenge, the idea of this kernel is to provide quality of life functions to extract certain information about COVID-19 papers. The content is far from being particularly creative or perfect, but it will hopefully save time to other people interested in the challenge.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n1.
