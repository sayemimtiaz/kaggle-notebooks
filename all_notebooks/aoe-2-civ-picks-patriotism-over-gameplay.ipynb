The choice of the civilization to play is not purely cosmetic, but affects significantly the gameplay, with every one having a different roster of units available, plus specific in-game bonuses, like for example Aztecs cannot train cavalry units, but have melee infantry with extra attack.\n\nNormally the choice of the civilization to play is thus an in-game strategic choice, based on your own playstyle, the settings of the game and the kind of civilization you expect the opponent to pick. We see if it is a common thing for players to decide to choose instead to play the civilization that live on their homeland, and how this affects their success in the game.
