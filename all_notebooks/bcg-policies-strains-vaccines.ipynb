By Dr Marcel A Behr\n\nPublished:February, 2002DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(02)00182-2\n\nThe existence of different BCG strains has been described since the 1940s. These strains vary according to several laboratory properties, which may or may not translate into a discernible effect on vaccination.\n\nWith recent genomic comparisons, it is now clear that different BCG vaccine strains have evolved and differ from each other and from the original BCG first used in 1921. Some of these genetic alterations explain certain variations in laboratory properties of BCG. However, these mutations in BCG strains have yet to be shown to affect BCG-associated protection and/or adverse effects. \n\nContinuing research is attempting to assess the effect of these genetic alterations on properties of BCG strains, with the goals of suggesting the ideal BCG for vaccination and providing avenues for improvement on existing BCG vaccines.\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473309902001822.pdf","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Different Strains of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin Vaccine Have Very Different Effects on Tuberculosis and on Unrelated Infections\n\nBy Frank Shann - Department of Paediatrics, Intensive Care Unit, Royal Children’s Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia - Jun 9, 2015\n\nIn high-mortality countries, until a different vaccine is given, BCG vaccine also provides nonspecific (heterologous)protection against diseases other than tuberculosis and leprosy (mainly respiratory infections and sepsis). \n\nAn important finding in the study in rural Guinea-Bissau was that among infants who had received BCG–Moscow vaccine, those with a scar had a 52 per cent (95 per cent CI, 10 per cent–74 per cent) lower mortality rate than those with no scar. The authors present evidence that the lower mortality was unlikely to be explained by healthier children being more likely to form a scar, and the results are consistent with previous studies showing a relationship between BCG–Danish vaccine scar and survival.\n\nIn addition to the important genetic differences between the strains of BCG, there are genetic differences within some strains that can cause major differences in the characteristics of BCG vaccine produced from the same seed lot by different manufacturers and between different batches from a single manufacturer. BCG-Tokyo and BCG-Danish vaccines each contain at least 2 genotypes. BCG–Danish vaccine and probably BCG–Tokyo vaccine have potent nonspecific effects that substantially reduce mortality from diseases other than tuberculosis; however, these beneficial effects are not properly exploited at present. \n\nhttps://watermark.silverchair.com/civ454.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAqAwggKcBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKNMIICiQIBADCCAoIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMUl5xbptDKcm4IIz8AgEQgIICU5-mvna7_1GF_uo8mFEjKjdQArrCyF6A8TrH-t7_Zo_WRFVxtereMobF1hYBKcQbPaTPMau2a4QWPedT-Oca0i_rE3xZkfPlbYHr7jRESmtddIzqKkmeTALijHLIQqXM8V0nMNIeKv1Ra-OIVOSU7q5-Tsm3wbvxk2cx99pk9EHZadCns569JIOjMuhV8M9Ap32Cc9R12aiod5g_dMvDbmjs4f9VWC7yuyHmBLGtk8852Ei-g6Czhf00Rp5hVLzaGoIBQ08SCwqIpQl_2NQXyo-LeeeFeNP5JhyfOY4zi9KaatBkQC8pQGpodwwTPmAmuLmX9Sb0Co6JQJJRcuveWvXDTWJ4wG0ppXTlUfCAdh1USBAHp4wMlr_PAUsgm03IDppoprj6MFi5lPgLe7EpoUSDohzlie4Lrsjj1Hs3OFhRGRqoBPqrMOsa5GtCmaPfNDpqlB7DUph0fT5uFgY7mRQg3XxmCWNkQpcwwvVO1oYQ2OY-EzXRXzpRQ9vbz-eT9F1HzpcPxty78aMK1vbgSI0xxoqGmX4CHTtdI1Zdvlmah8Vq-saAYpTghgMJfFpk8kqfPIXIdVhlxdhFGeLoL0NhGAZ8c4xsZZRdJAHBX9D6mUrJbCe8-bo92wgEpsWld_-0DGeudUGarCDpHL2zJq6A_wU6yuayy3u1-ZdVbYt-UKmXEWquWT5h4T855K_Xy8-k_yFSuNRZtV2IkKIg9NnthlxCYBrvgRb6DLxkmd5W-O7R4dMNIwmg0XY4ukkBDzKGzxt7MzTVSIBb2LXfNsYWYw4","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/task_2-BCG_world_atlas_data-bcg_strain-7July2020.csv', encoding='utf8')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#BCG strain over the years has been used in different countries since the creation of the vaccine and during what time periods.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(24, 6))\nplt.subplot(131)\nsns.countplot(df['bcg_strain_original'],order = df['bcg_strain_original'].value_counts(dropna=False).index)\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.subplot(132)\nsns.countplot(df['bcg_strain_du_class'],order = df['bcg_strain_du_class'].value_counts(dropna=False).index)\nplt.subplot(133)\nsns.countplot(df['bcg_strain_t_cell_grp_3'],order = df['bcg_strain_t_cell_grp_3'].value_counts(dropna=False).index)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize = (20,6), sharex=True)\nsns.countplot(x='bcg_strain_original',data=df, palette=\"copper\", ax=ax[0])\nsns.countplot(x='bcg_strain_original',hue='bcg_policy_first_year_original', palette=\"ocean\", data=df,ax=ax[1])\nsns.countplot(x='bcg_strain_original',hue='bcg_policy_last_year_original', palette=\"cubehelix\", data=df,ax=ax[2])\nax[0].title.set_text('BCG Strain Original Count')\nax[1].title.set_text('BCG Strain Original Vs First Year Policy')\nax[2].title.set_text('BCG Strain Original Vs Last Year Policy ')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['bcg_policy_first_year_original'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(16, 8))\nax.set_title('BCG Policies 1st Year Original', size=18)\nax.set_ylabel('bcg_policy_first_year_original', size=10)\nax.set_xlabel('bcg_strain_original', size=10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['bcg_policy_last_year_original'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(16, 8), color='r')\nax.set_title('BCG Policies Last Year Original', size=18)\nax.set_ylabel('bcg_policy_last_year_original', size=10)\nax.set_xlabel('bcg_strain_original', size=10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Different Strains of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin Vaccine Have ...academic.oup.com › cid › article-pdf › civ454\nJun 9, 2015, By Frank Shann - Department of Paediatrics, Intensive Care Unit, Royal Children’s Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia\n\nThe BCG vaccine is not a single vaccine; the different strains have very different properties, and there are different genotypes within strains.

BCG vaccine may also have important nonspecific effects in high-income countries. In a cohort study in Spain, BCG–Danish vaccine reduced nontuberculous hospital admissions in infants by 32 per cent (95 per cent CI, 31 per cent–34 per cent) for respiratory infections and by 53 per cent (95 per cent CI, 44 per cent–61 per cent) for sepsis.\n\nIt would be desirable to test whether revaccination with BCG vaccine reduces all-cause mortality in children who do not develop a scar after a single dose. In addition, in the randomized trial in Guinea-Bissau that showed reduced mortality after revaccination at age 19 months, 77 per cent of the children had a scar . Consequently, further randomized trials are needed to test the effects of revaccination on all-cause mortality in children who have a scar following BCG vaccination at birth, as well as those without a\nscar. Revaccination with BCG vaccine confers little or no extra protection against tuberculosis but it may improve protection\nagainst leprosy and increase the beneficial nonspecific effects of BCG vaccine.\n\nIt's known that BCG vaccine protects against infections other than tuberculosis,at least in part, by an epigenetic effect mediated by methylation of histone that alters innate immunity in adults and neonates. It would be ironic if they were to discover that BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis via a nonspecific effect mediated by innate immunity. They urgently need to know more about the mechanisms by which BCG vaccine protects against mycobacterial and nonmycobacterial infections.\n\nhttps://watermark.silverchair.com/civ454.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAp4wggKaBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKLMIIChwIBADCCAoAGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMc7XkkxH0ji-h5pGIAgEQgIICUZuB3mvftiCqTEGwoJ5due8WoUP8eYnKjgjPHxHjJaBwZ0bKYyyJ8G3eS38lk_Qb5_JI7XdyHI8SZII3T3lNblg6zQ0-uA50RRG95Qn7eKtVHZXlbAKVUwVepV5k_dSQYmmft8erc-0ns224a7BU2MxDspQdD7bLN9145KmB0SFdCjR9YUFs58YDDcOL9XTtK2OKBA_L0zUqShkBJhNO6l8IozplL9C9Yyy7gpndV2aGY4LgdXrRpKKw0MqKmgoG5JQnySKf9I_8omSUx4JDfu6x2OPPpBr0n3PV1PC3Zah7EgNwSeC-d7kTGI_DEOWnVMTx2DikOvF7KBdPi9Gz1XItxjVSpn0eS1RY3wlORtTFMl4NbqZK46zbHRUOzHPC7-NBBQaRPVDflgWNvQ5gXWkZwih6G05mAe2OEXwSY3AZJHOy6XzFyCfsGGxBe3vKup4axO5vQ2Edtcdm4gJJGBcGJ8dr0CsAFAspBcFUT6vNmRCtBx0d380JM5ooBJHSMqKQEZBANFmguDCyHzn21i_L5RD9yEQHk1TcN1IFwLCV3oxL6_vEusV1UGJNNJOIi25EcXduwHz8MBZ4k-bLFwJqQ90pryuIk_IS10EqakmxlvWD3ozb18XC51wAwDe9otI8bVgaYiCOyz7BKHQmh78lBRGqudC89uTpLHqVR6w0T1gF_1jo3jv2NCD_L8h76JhpeBNDYALKo31719wTne2Lhijyta431bChj9if0MzL3NJjWVBaituOXYdz6Oq6mMjxp044zjLfkvZ7JEPVwCVe","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['were_revaccinations_recommended'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(16, 8), color='g')\nax.set_title('Were revaccinations recommended?', size=18)\nax.set_ylabel('were_revaccinations_recommended', size=10)\nax.set_xlabel('count', size=10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['timing_of_revaccination'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(16, 8), color='g')\nax.set_title('BCG Time interval of revaccination', size=18)\nax.set_ylabel('Timing of revaccination', size=10)\nax.set_xlabel('count', size=10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.bar(df[['timing_of_revaccination','country_name']].sort_values('country_name', ascending=False), \n                        y = \"country_name\", x= \"timing_of_revaccination\", color='country_name', template='ggplot2')\nfig.update_xaxes(tickangle=45, tickfont=dict(family='Rockwell', color='crimson', size=14))\nfig.update_layout(title_text=\"BCG Time interval of revaccination by country\")\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.bar(df, \n             x='timing_of_revaccination', y='country_name', color_discrete_sequence=['#27F1E7'],\n             title='BCG Revaccination Time Interval', text='bcg_strain_original')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#East and West Germany different BCG vaccination schemes before 1990.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By Luis E.
