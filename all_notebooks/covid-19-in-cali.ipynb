Scientific Model and Strategy: My procedures are very data driven. I back all my conclusions with data, and use statistical techniques like regressions to find patterns and relationships in the data. \n3. Novel Insights: I have summarized my key findings in the end of the notebook. However, some important novel insights are the third and forth key point: \n    3.While Imperial and Kings counties have been able to keep the death: cases ratio low, the low ICU availability and the high percentage of the population with the virus may be a strong indication that these counties might experience a higher death/cases ratio in the coming weeks.\n    \n    4.There is a strong relationship between a counties COVID-19 cases as a percentage of population and the metrics: percentage of people with housing with 10 or more units and percentage of houses with more rooms than people. This may be due in part to California’s social distancing policies. \n4. Market Translation and Applicability: This notebook resolves a need for State-wide Public Health officials as it analyzes very recent COVID-19 data, identifies hard hit and potentially at risk counties, and provides some insights into why counties differ in their COVID-19 cases as a percent of county population. \n5. Speed to market: The important features of the regression and ICU results should be integrated in risk-assesment tools when determing resource allocation. \n6. Longevity of solution in market: This notebook can be duplicated in other states easily, because all the data is publically available in the same datasets used here. \n7.

Furthermore, it appears that ep_crowd is not significant in this model. The model explained 58.4% of the variation(r^2). The second model is a simpler model, as it contains just the variables without the squared feature. In this model, both variables are statistically significant with low p-values. Also, the R-Squared and adjusted R-squared values are only about .02 lower than the more complex model. This increases favorability for the simpler model as it is more transparent and almost as effective. \n\nFrom this regression analysis, it is clear that the ep_munit and ep_crowd characteristics are very important characteristics that could explain the difference in spread of COVID-19 in California. Just these two variables explain more than a majority (55.6%) of the variation in total cases as a percentage as a population.  Intuitively, this provides evidence to the theory that counties with more apartment/dorm-like structures, should have a higher COVID case percentage since people are in more frequent contact with each other.  \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets visualize these two features: ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(social.sort_values(\"ep_munit\", ascending=False)[[\"county\",\"ep_munit\"]].reset_index().drop(\"index\", axis=1).loc[:9])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(social.sort_values(\"ep_crowd\", ascending=False)[[\"county\",\"ep_crowd\"]].reset_index().drop(\"index\", axis=1).loc[:9])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"new=social.merge(cali, left_on=\"county\",right_on=\"NAME\", how=\"inner\")[[\"county\",\"geometry_y\",\"ep_crowd\",\"ep_munit\"]]\nnew.rename(columns = {'geometry_y':'geometry'}, inplace = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.close()\n\nnew=geo.GeoDataFrame(new)\nax= new.plot(column=\"ep_munit\",cmap=\"Greens\",figsize=(10,10),legend=True,edgecolor=\"black\",linewidth=0.4)\nax.set_title(\"Percent of People in Housing with 10 or more Units \")\nax.set_axis_off()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.close()\n\nnew=geo.GeoDataFrame(new)\nax= new.plot(column=\"ep_crowd\",cmap=\"Greens\",figsize=(10,10),legend=True,edgecolor=\"black\",linewidth=0.4)\nax.set_title(\"Percent of Houses with More People than Rooms \")\nax.set_axis_off()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first map represents MUNIT while the second represent CROWD.

This trend and the drastic increase in residential mobility are strong indicators that the social distancing efforts have been efficient.
