Those are presented in blockquotes colored in dark blue. <br>\n<blockquote>\n    <font color=\"darkblue\">This is a comment!</font>\n</blockquote>\nFeedback is extremly welcome.

If you're somewhat like me you will think twice before going through this whole document.\n\n## TLDR Version\nThis dataset contains information on suicide rates between 1985 and 2015 for 100 countries in the world. Year 2016 is included in the data but it is assumed to be incomplete. Not all countries are present in all years. It is divided in age groups and gender. I start analyzing changes over years and find a peak in 1995 which I later attribute to Russia's increasing suicides. \n\nI then group the countries into regions but found nothing of interest. In countries granularity I plot the top 10 for both extremes (low and high) for all years and more recently. While in the low end the top 10 didn't change a lot, the high suicide rates top 10 changed quite a bit for the last few years. \n\nI proceed analysing age groups and gender to find a pattern of higher number of suicides in males and older people. This varies for each country but it is an overall trend. I do not analyse generations.\n\nOn looking at GDP I plot its correlation with suicide rates for every country and find two different clusters of countries which I name low and high quadrants. Both have opposite correlations between SR and GDP. I discuss my personal opinion on that by the end of chapter 4.\n\nI later add data on Religion and world temperature. The analysis suggests higher temperatures and a more religious country lowers suicide rates. \n\nIn chapter 6 I provide an interactive dashboard to see how each country in the dataset is doing. Finally, in chapter 7, I present this work's conclusions."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n---"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <b>1 - The Dataset</b>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.1 - Introducing the Data\n### General Information\n- Original format: csv\n- Dataset shape: 27820 x 12 (rows x columns)\n- 19456 missing values for HDI\n\n### Features in the dataset\n#### <u>Categorical features</u>\n**Country**: A total of 101 countries are included in this dataset.

The correlations are definitely not causation. <br></font></p>\n\n<p><font color='darkcyan'><b>Personal Opinion</b>: Our brain goes back to millions of years. We've lived most of that time without money. Our brain knows how to be happy without money and its chemical processes don't need a bank account to work perfectly fine. However, I do believe money might lead to suicide when people live by and for it. When your happiness depends on your money and it suddently goes away, or when your life is about getting money and when you finally do, you find no meaning in it. Sure, those things can happen, but that is not about money, that is about culture and beliefs.</font></p>  \n\n**B: The Lower Quadrant**\n<p><font color='green'><b>Data:</b> We've identified this pattern in the two confusing graphs presented in this section. Countries in this quadrant seem to have a positive correlation between SR and GDP.<br></font></p>\n\n<p><font color='darkcyan'><b>Personal Opinion</b>: I can think of two possible things to attribute this behavior: People are getting older and Disconnection.\n    <ol>\n        <li>People are getting older: This is just looking at the plot presented on demographic groups: older people have higher suicide ratios and this is a trend. It has been observed in other countries that as GDP, Education and other factors increase, the birth rates decrease and the population shifts towards an inverse pyramid (older people in a bigger share).</li>\n        <li>Disconnection: This one is more subtle and perhaps controversial opinion. As these younger countries in the lower quadrant 'grow', more people get in touch with first-world things, such as habits and devices. The more we connect in instagram and facebook, **the more we disconnect to our non-digital lives and communities**. You might have a different opinion on this digital society we live in and say that it helps some people. I believe it does, but looking at the whole picture, does it helps us as a species? You must agree that unlike money, we have lived in close intimate communities and had close and intimate relationships for millions of years. And the data dont lie. Such developing countries or countries that don't have that much technology imbued in its culture have lower suicide ratios. This epidemy of anxiety and depression are a 21st century thing.

However, these vary a lot for each individual country (chapter 3.5)\n- We've decided not to analyse Generation due to its subjectivity (not sure if this is a word) (chapter 3.6)\n\nIn **Chapter Three** GDP's effect on suicides was explored. We've seen that GDP and SR correlation varies a lot for each individual country and we've concluded that this was not a causation.\nWe've also highlighted two distinct clusters (named quadrants in the analysis) in our data that had opposite correlations between GDP and SR. On 4.3 I discuss why I believe GDP alone is not an important factor and give my opinion on the quadrants.\n\n**Chapter Four** briefly explores and discusses how two other features can influence suicide - religion and temperature.\n\nFinally, **Chapter Five** presents an interactive dashboard to explore these measures on different countries. \n\nLeave your thoughts or questions in the comments.
