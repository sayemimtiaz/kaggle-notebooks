However, navigating through an already vast volume of literature that continues to grow in a head-spinnig speed is extremely difficult, preventing a timely information sharing and decision making. \nAiming to trackle this challenge, in this work, we employ a semantic text mining approach to efficiently allocate and digest the most relevant literature given a query research task. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Overview of the SciReader\nSciReader achieves semantic text mining via a word embedding approach. We utilize the [sciSpacy](#https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) NLP model, which is trained on biomedical literature corpus, to perform tokenization and named entity recognition, as well as the embedding vectorization of the words & entities. Quantifying the similarity between the embedding vectors of the named entities enpowers a [semantic keyword search](#Semantic-Keyword-Search). The [semantic search at the sentence level](#Semantic-Sentence-Search) is based on calculating the word mover's distance between groups of tokens using the [wmd](#https://github.com/src-d/wmd-relax) package.
