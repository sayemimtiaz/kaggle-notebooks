It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api. The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can therefore be used to detect sentiment. The training data was automatically created, as opposed to having humans manual annotate tweets.

Since normally, NLP models cannot parse those data, we need to clean up the tweet and replace tokens that actually contains meaningful information for the model.\n\n**The Preprocessing steps taken are:**\n1. **Lower Casing:** Each text is converted to lowercase.\n2. **Replacing URLs:** Links starting with **'http' or 'https' or 'www'** are replaced by **'<url\\>'**.\n3. **Replacing Usernames:** Replace @Usernames with word **'<user\\>'**. [eg: '@Kaggle' to '<user\\>'].\n4. **Replacing Consecutive letters:** 3 or more consecutive letters are replaced by 2 letters. [eg: 'Heyyyy' to 'Heyy']\n5. **Replacing Emojis:** Replace emojis by using a regex expression. [eg: ':)' to '<smile\\>']\n6. **Replacing Contractions:** Replacing contractions with their meanings. [eg: \"can't\" to 'can not']\n7. **Removing Non-Alphabets:** Replacing characters except Digits, Alphabets and pre-defined Symbols with a space.\n\nAs much as the preprocessing steps are important, the actual sequence is also important while cleaning up the text.

One of the most commonly used classification models in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the Naive Bayesian.\nNaive Bayesian classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but rather a family of algorithms where all of them make the following naive assumptions:\n\n- All features are independent from each other.\n- Every feature contributes equally to the output.\n\nIn our case, these two assumptions can be interpreted as:\n\n- Each word is independent from the other words, no relation between any two words of a given sentence.\n- Each word contributes equally, throughout all sentences, to the decision of our model, regardless of its relative position in the sentence.\n\nExample: \"This is bad\" / \"This is very bad\" or \"Such a kind person\" / \"This kind of chocolate is disgusting\", in both cases the Naive Bayesian classifier would give the same importance for the words 'bad' and 'kind', albeit them having a stronger meaning and a different meaning respectively in first and second sentences.\n\n\nThe Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event $A$, based on prior knowledge of conditions $B$ that might be related to the event: \n\n$P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)}$\n\nIn our case, this can be intuitively interpreted as the probability of a tweet being positive, based on prior knowledge of the words inside the input text. In a nutshell, this probability is: the probability of the first word occuring in a positive tweet, times, the probability of the second word occuring in a positive tweet, ..., times, the probability of a tweet being positive. \n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from time import time\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\n                \nstart_time = time()\n\npipe = Pipeline([('vect', CountVectorizer()),\n                     ('clf', MultinomialNB())])\n\n\n# Parameters of pipelines can be set using ‘__’ separated parameter names:\nparam_grid = {\n    'vect__binary': [True, False], # If True, all non zero counts are set to 1.

As such, the **regularization** introduced in the model seem to work perfectly well. For example we have have two drop out layers embeded in the LSTM layers of the model. The accuracy curve has flattened but is still rising, which means that training for more epochs probably will yield even better results.\n\nThe **validation loss** is lower than the **training loss** because the dropouts in LSTM aren't active while evaluating the model.\n\n**Over-Fitting** is basically the phenomenon where the model's performance on validation data starts degrading, while still achieving great progress on the test set.

Basically, what dropout does is that it randomly eliminates several (based on a parametrized percentage rate) neurons connections in the network, rendering the model less complex, and forcing the model to only look at part of a given example. The random elimination of connections in the model is repeated randomly for each example training data.\n\n\nFor example, let's consider the following sentences, with a dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 (50% of connections will be eliminated): \n\n> \"Another kind of regularization can be directly applied to the cost function\"\n>\n> \"This is my first ever notebook.
