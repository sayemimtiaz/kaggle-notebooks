In addition it provides an easier to read summary of the model's  \nperformance at the end of each epoch. It also provides a handy feature  \nthat enables you to set the number of epochs to train for until a message  \nasks if you wish to halt training on the current epoch by entering H or  \nto enter an integer which will determine how many more epochs to run  \nbefore the message appears again. This is very useful if you are training  \na model and decide the metrics are satisfactory and you want to end  \nthe model training early. Note the callback always returns your model  \nwith the weights set to those of the epoch which had the highest performance  \non the metric being monitored (accuracy or validation accuracy)  \nThe callback initially monitors training accuracy and will adjust the learning  \nrate based on that until the accuracy reaches a user specified threshold  \nlevel. Once that level of training accuracy is achieved the callback switches  \nto monitoring validation loss and adjusts the learning rate based on that.  \nthe callback is of the form:  \ncallbacks=[LRA(model, patience, stop_patience, threshold,factor, dwell,\n               model_name, freeze, batches,initial_epoch, epochs, ask_epoch )]    \n **where:**\n - **model** is your compiled model\n - **patience** is an integer that determines many consecutive epochs can occur before the learning rate\n   will be adjusted (similar to patience parameter in Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau)\n \n - **stop_patience** is an integer that determines hom many consecutive epochs for which the\n   learning rate was adjusted but no improvement in the monitored metric occurred before\n   training is halted(similar to patience parameter in early stopping)\n \n - **threshold** is a float that determines the level that training accuracy must achieve\n   before the callback switches over to monitoring validation loss. This  is useful for\n   cases where the validation loss in early epochs tends to vary widely and can cause\n   unwanted behavior when using the conventional Keras callbacks\n - **factor** is a float that determines the new learning rate by the equation lr=lr*factor.\n   (similar to the factor parameter in Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau)\n - **dwell** is a boolean. It is used in the callback as part of an experiment on training\n   models. If on a given epoch the metric being monitored fails to improve it means\n   your model has moved to a location on the surface of Nspace (where N is the number\n   of trainable parameters) that is NOT as favorable (poorer metric performance) than\n   the position in Nspace you were in for the previous epoch. If dwell is set to True\n   the callback loads the model with the weights from the previous (better metric value)\n   epoch. Why move to a worse place if the place you were in previously was better. Then\n   the learning rate is reduced for the next epoch of training. If dwell is set to false\n   this action does not take place.\n \n - **model_name** is a string\n - **freeze** is just a boolean\n   Note model_name and freeze are simply used to print out a header at the start of training.\n   For example is model_name is set to 'InceptionResnetV2' and freeze is set to False\n   the header would appear as 'Training InceptionResnetV2 traing all layers'. If freeze\n   is set to False the header would be 'Training InceptionRenetV2 base model layers frozen'\n   Parameter freese does not make the basemodel non trainable you must do that in\n   seperate code when building your model.\n - **batches** is an integer. It should be set to a value of \n   batches=int(number of traing samples/batch_size). During training the callback provides\n   information during an epoch of the form\n   'processing batch of batches  accuracy= accuracy  loss= loss where batch is the current \n    batch being processs, batches is as described above, accuracy is the current training\n    accuracy and loss is the current loss. Typically the message would appear as\n    processing batch 25 of 50  accuracy: 54%  loss: .04567. As each batch is processed\n    these values are changed.    \n - **initial_epoch** is an integer. Typically set this to zero Itis used in the information\n    printed out for each epoch. In the case where you train the model say with the\n    basemodel weights frozen say you train for 10 epochs. Then you want to fine tune\n    the model and train for more eppochs for the second training session you would\n    reinstantiate the callback and set initial_epoch=10.\n - **epochs** an integer value for the number of epochs to train\n - **ask_epoch** is either set to an integer value or None. If set to an integer it denotes\n    the epoch number at which user input is requested. If the user enter H training is\n    halted. If the user inters an integer it represents how many more epochs to run\n    before you are asked for the user input again. If ask_epoch is set to None the\n    user is NOT asked to provide any input. This feature is handy is when training your model\n    and the metrics are either unsatisfactory and you want to stop training, or for the case\n    where your metrics are satisfactory and there is no need to train any further. Note\n    you model is always set to the weights for the epoch that had the beset metric\n    performance. So if you halt the training you can still use the model for predictions.  \n      \n ### ** Example of Use:\n callbacks=[LRA(my_model, 2, 5, .9, .5, True, 'InceptionResnetV2', False, 80,20,10)]\n this implies:\n - your model is my_model\n - after 2 epochs of no improvement the learning rate will be reduced\n - after 5 consecutive adjustment of the leaarning rate with no metric improve training terminates\n - once the training accuracy reaches 90% the callback adjust learning rate based on validation loss\n - when the learning rate is adjust the new learning rate is .5 X learning rate\n - if the current epoch's metric value did not improve, the weights for the prior epoch are loaded\n   and the learning rate is reduced\n - the string name of your model to print in the header at the start of training\n - the header will note the entire model is being trained\n - the number of batches per epoch is 80\n - train for 20 epochs\n - after the tenth epoch you will be asked if you want to halt training by entering H or enter \n   an integer denoting how many more epochs to run before you will be prompted again\n                 ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import
