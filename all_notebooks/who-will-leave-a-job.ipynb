This is because at each tree level, the score of a possible split will be equal whether the respective feature has been scaled or not.\n\nYou can think of it like here: We're dealing with a binary classification problem and the feature we're splitting takes values from 0 to 1000. If you split it on 300, the samples <300 belong 90% to one category while those >300 belong 30% to one category. Now imaging this feature is scaled between 0 and 1.

It defines how accurate your model is. For example, if you build a model that classifies 90 samples accurately, your accuracy is 90% or 0.90. If only 83 samples are classified correctly, the accuracy of your model is 83% or 0.83.

We have got 0.788 precision which is pretty good\n\n     **[True Positives (TP)](https://blog.exsilio.com/all/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures/)** - These are the correctly predicted positive values which means that the value of actual class is yes and the value of predicted  class is also yes. E.g. if actual class value indicates that this passenger survived and predicted class tells you the same thing.\n\n     **[True Negatives (TN)](https://blog.exsilio.com/all/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures/)** - These are the correctly predicted negative values which means that the value of actual class is no and value of predicted class is also no. E.g. if actual class says this passenger did not survive and predicted class tells you the same thing.\n\n     False positives and false negatives, these values occur when your actual class contradicts with the predicted class.\n\n     **[False Positives (FP)](https://blog.exsilio.com/all/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures/)** – When actual class is no and predicted class is yes.

The question recall answers is: Of all the passengers that truly survived, how many did we label? We have got recall of 0.631 which is good for this model as it’s above 0.5.\n\n     **[Scikit-learn user guide for Recall](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html#sklearn.metrics.recall_score)**\n\n\n- **[Confusion Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/)** : A much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the confusion matrix. The general idea is to count the number of times instances of class A are classified as class B. For example, to know the number of times the classifier confused images of 5s with 3s, you would look in the 5th row and 3rd column of the confusion matrix.\n\n    **[Scikit-Learn user guide for Confusion Matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html)**\n     \n     \n- **[F1 score (F1)](https://blog.exsilio.com/all/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures/)** : F1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. Intuitively it is not as easy to understand as accuracy, but F1 is usually more useful than accuracy, especially if you have an uneven class distribution. Accuracy works best if false positives and false negatives have similar cost. If the cost of false positives and false negatives are very different, it’s better to look at both Precision and Recall. In our case, F1 score is 0.701. \n\n     **[Scikit-learn user guide for F1 score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)**\n\n\n- **[Area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve](https://machinelearningmastery.com/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-classification-in-python/)** : AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. By analogy, the Higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between patients with the disease and no disease.\n\n     **[Scikit-learn user guide for AUC under the ROC curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**When it comes to regression, the most commonly used [evaluation metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluation-metrics-model-selection-in-linear-regression-73c7573208be) are:**\n\n\n- Mean absolute error (MAE)\n- Mean squared error (MSE)\n- Root mean squared error (RMSE)\n- Root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE)\n- Mean percentage error (MPE)\n- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)\n- R2\n\n **[Scikit-learn user guide for regression evaluation metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(train['target'], edgecolor = 'black')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see that the target is **skewed** and thus the best metric for this binary classification problem would be Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
