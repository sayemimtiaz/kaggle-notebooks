You can calculate how many centimeters (cm) of mouse movement you need to do a 360 degree turn in game by diving a large constant by the eDPI (eDPI and cm/360 are inversely correlated). This means that the the more you raise your eDPI, the less you need to move your mouse physically to perform a full 360 in game. The advantage of a high eDPI is that you can turn faster in-game with less physical movement, granting you more speed and flexibility. However, the disadvantage is that your physical mouse movements need to be more accurate. If a player using a high eDPI moves their mouse 5cm too far to the left, it will look much worse in-game than if a low eDPI player did.\n\nMost players choose their in-game sensitivity with the balance between flexibility and accuracy in mind as well as their in-game playstyle and duties. Others just go by what feels natural. Either way, these players are professionals so they know what they're doing!  \n\nThat said, here are the explanations for the average eDPI of each role. \n\nReminder that these are all **general**. There are many exceptions mainly due to the versatility of heros/playstyles in each role and, of course, the fact that sensitivity ultimately comes down to personal prefernece. \n\n* **Tanks**: In general, tank heroes require less accuracy than other roles because of thier in-game duties. This explains the higher average eDPI. On average, tank players will sacrifice accuracy for flexibility in their aim. However, the variance is also high because some tank heros focus on protecting the team and creating positional opportunities while other tank heros focus on helping the other tank do their job while dealing damage to opponents. Becasue heroes with vastly different playstyles are categorized into one category as \"tank\", the variance is high. \n\n* **Supports**: Similar to the tank role, heroes in the support category have a variety of different playstyles, which explains the high variance. However, on average, the eDPI is the lowest of the three caregories. This is most likley due to certain support heroes needing extremely precise aim. Their roles include healing the team and also dealing damage. Both actions require accurate aim, thus, bringing the average eDPI down. However, some support heroes require little to no aim which brings the eDPI and variance up. \n\n* **Damage**: The damage role has the smallest variance and a bit higher average eDPI than the support role. The main role of all damage heroes is obviously to deal damage. Unlike  other roles, the damage role better categorizes the heroes because they all have the same duty: to deal damage. This explains the low variance. The average sensitivity, however, is slightly higher than supports. This is most likely because, although most damage heroes have the same duty, they all perform their duty in different ways. Some heroes have sniper rifles which require pin-point accuracy, while others have projectile weapons which have splash damage (damages a general area) and do not need to be that accurate. The accuracy needed in order to use these different weapons vary. This is where the small bit of variance as well as the slightly high average eDPI comes from.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculate averages based on heroes\naverage_by_hero = owl_player_settings.groupby(\"Hero\").mean()\nsns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(25,9)})\nsns.barplot(x='Hero', y='eDPI', data=owl_player_settings.sort_values(\"cmPer360\"))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T23:08:53.154225Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T23:08:53.154657Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T23:08:54.189341Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T23:08:53.154617Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T23:08:54.18832Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/joshuaswords/awesome-eda-2021-happiness-population\n\nQUARTZ = '#4A4C4E'\nYELLOW_ORANGE = '#FA9C1D'\nWHITE = '#FFF'\n\nfig=plt.figure(figsize=(7,3),facecolor=WHITE)\n\nax0=fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\nax0.text(0.50,0.7,\"Average eDPI\",color=QUARTZ,fontsize=35, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='calibri',ha='center')\n\nax0.text(0,0.4, edpi_tank,color=YELLOW_ORANGE,fontsize=25, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='calibri',ha='center')\nax0.text(0,0.2,\"Tank\",color=QUARTZ,fontsize=20, fontweight='light', fontfamily='calibri',ha='center')\n\nax0.text(1,0.4,edpi_dmg,color=YELLOW_ORANGE,fontsize=25, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='calibri',ha='center')\nax0.text(1,0.2,\"Damage\",color=QUARTZ,fontsize=20, fontweight='light', fontfamily='calibri',ha='center')\n\nax0.text(0.5,0.4,edpi_supp,color=YELLOW_ORANGE,fontsize=25, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='calibri',ha='center')\nax0.text(0.5,0.2,\"Support\",color=QUARTZ,fontsize=20, fontweight='light', fontfamily='v',ha='center')\n\n\nax0.set_yticklabels('')\nax0.tick_params(axis='y',length=0)\nax0.tick_params(axis='x',length=0)\nax0.set_xticklabels('')\nax0.set_facecolor(WHITE)\nfor direction in ['top','right','left','bottom']:\n    ax0.spines[direction].set_visible(False)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T23:04:12.926506Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T23:04:12.926846Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T23:04:13.353963Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T23:04:12.926812Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T23:04:13.353061Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Looking at Mouse Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"top_5_mice = dict(owl_player_settings['MouseModel'].value_counts()[:5])\nfig=plt.figure(figsize=(20,5),facecolor=WHITE)\n\nplt.title(\"Most Popular Mice\")\nplt.bar(range(len(top_5_mice)), list(top_5_mice.values()), align='center')\nplt.xticks(range(len(top_5_mice)), list(top_5_mice.keys()))\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T23:12:56.200401Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T23:12:56.200843Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T23:12:56.397889Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T23:12:56.200802Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T23:12:56.397113Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Currently, Logitech seems to be the king in OWL in terms of mice.
