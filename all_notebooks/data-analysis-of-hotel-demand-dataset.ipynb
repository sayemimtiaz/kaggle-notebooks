Portugal's guests has high probability canceled their booking for city hotel and resort hotel. Furthermore, the bigger proportion of guests are adults. It can said that most of guests are couple, man and wife or tour group.

Because they have a lot of loyalty customer compare to resort hotel.For Most of guest is like to stay in weekday by 72.6% compare to stay in weekend by 27.4%. It is not a small gap. In addition, they was willing to have a 1 or 2 day stay in weekend or weekday whether is city hotel and resort hotel.For meal package, the most of guests was like to pick the BB (Bed and Breakfast Package) whether is city hotel or resort hotel.

While resort hotel should put effort on customer relation management to keep their guests loyaltly. Besides,this data anlaysis is still inadequate for analyze the booking cancelation and room rate.\n\n\n\n","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
