We also looked for columns that contained almost exclusively a single value, since those aren't likely to be helpful for any analysis we wish to do. The columns that needed particular attention were as follows.\n\n- `seller`, `offer_type`, `nr_of_pictures`: Contain almost exclusively a single value. We should drop these columns.\n- `vehicle_type`, `gearbox`, `model`, `fuel_type`, `unrepaired_damage`: Contain missing values, though none has more than 20% missing values.

In addition, the `vehicle_type`, `gearbox`, `fuel_type`, and `unrepaired_damage` columns contain categorical data that uses German words, so those can be translated into English for easier comprehension.\n- `date_crawled`, `ad_created`, `last_seen`: Convert from string to pandas `datetime` type.\n- `price`: Convert from string to float. About 3% of values are impossible (a price of \\$0) and 14 values are potentially unrealistic (prices exceeding \\$350,000). It is safe to drop the rows with impossible prices, but we should think more carefully before dropping or imputing the unrealistic ones depending on the analysis we wish to do.\n- `registration_year`: About 4% of the values are impossible (prior to 1906 or after 2016). It is fairly safe to drop the rows with these impossible registration years.\n- `registration_month`: About 10% of the values are impossible (0). We should consider either dropping the corresponding rows, imputing the values, or leaving them as-is, depending on the analysis we wish to do.\n- `power_ps`: About 11% of the entries are impossible (either 0 or exceeding 2000).
