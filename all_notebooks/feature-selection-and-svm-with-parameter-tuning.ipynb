Introduction**\n\nI understand this exercise as \"Design a tool for the medical market\". The tool should help a doctor who has collected the required data of a patient that was diagnosed  with CVD to make proper decisions about further special treatment (e.g. medical surgery, medicine).\nOur aim is to use the data to train a machine learning model for classification. The response/target variable should be the *DEATH_EVENT*. \n\nDepending on the treatment a doctor might prefer a classifier with high recall or high presicion. Let's assume for a second that the treatment has a low risk for the patient but might indeed prevent death. In such a case false positives are more acceptable than false negatives and we might prefer a classifier with high recall over one with high precision. If the treatment has however a high risk to kill a patient who would have survivied without treatment, false negatives would be more acceptable and we might desire a model with higher precision. Hence the AUC score seems to be a good metric for measuring the performance of the classifier. \n\nNote that features have a medical and/or biophysical interpretation. Knowledge about the meaning and significance of the feature would be highly valuable.\n\nI should mention before hand that I view this notebook as an exercise and that a full fledged solution requires significantly more effort. Thoughts on this can be found in the conclusion section.\n\nLet's go."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import Normalize\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report, plot_roc_curve, accuracy_score, f1_score,roc_auc_score","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The file is located at"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2.)

Even if we do not have a medical interpretation at hand this information provides us at least with some physical information. We might for example try to construct new physically reasonable features via dimensional analysis. We don't care about the precise units at the moment since we will rescale the features anyways. A short explenation of the features (from a quick google search) and dimensions are\n\n**The features:**\n\n[age] = $T$\n\n**Creatine Phosphokinase** (a.k.a., creatine kinase, CPK, or CK) is an enzyme (a protein that helps to elicit chemical changes in your body) found in your heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. When muscle tissue is damaged, CPK leaks into your blood.\n\n[creatinine_phosphokinase] = $M L^{-3}$\n\n**Ejection fraction**, for example, refers to how well the left heart ventricle (or right ventricle) pumps blood with each heart beat. \n\n[ejection_fraction] = dimensionless\n\n\n**Platelets** form a platelet plug to stop bleeding from an injured blood vessel. In cardiovascular disease, abnormal clotting occurs that can result in heart attacks or stroke. Blood vessels injured by smoking, cholesterol, or high blood pressure develop cholesterol-rich build-ups (plaques) that line the blood vessel; these plaques can rupture and cause the platelets to form a clot.\n\n[platelets] = $L^{-3}$\n\nThe **serum creatinine** variable is a measure for kidney health. \nFrom this [paper](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.str.28.3.557):\n\"Stroke risk was significantly increased at levels above 116 μmol/L (90th percentile) even after adjustment for a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors.\"\n\n[serum_creatinine] = $ML^{-3}$\n\n\n**Serum Sodium** variable is measure for sorium content in blood. From this paper [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29935992/):\n\"In the multivariate model, low-level serum sodium was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.18 per standard deviation [SD]; P = 0.009), whereas a lower level of serum chloride was not (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12 per standard deviation; P = 0.278). Analyses with restrictive cubic splines yielded similar results.\"\n\n[serum_sodium] = $L^{-3}mol$\n\n\n\nMore on **time** later\n\n[time] = $T$ (surprise!)\n\n\n\nwhere $T,L,$ $M$ and $mol$ are time, length, mass and mole respectively.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: **Anemia** (also spelled anaemia) is a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin in the blood,[3][4] or a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen.\nHere is a [medical paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14531771/).\n\nThe remaining features should be clear.\n\n\n\nThe first 11 variables in [14] or combinations thereof can be used as feature variables. The variable *DEATH_EVENT* will be the response/target variable. The *time* variable requires deeper discussion and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n**The time variable**:\n\nThis variable appears to be the time which the patient already sees the doctor for treatment. \n\nIn the discussion section it was argued that time is a response/target variable and that it should not be used as a feature variable. I would say that this is indeed up to interpretation. One might for example construct a new binary feature from time. Let's say, by asking if the treatment of the patient took already longer than time $x$. The constructed variable is then a feature and might help a doctor decide if additional treatment is required.

Conclusion**\n\nThe AUC score looks actually quite good. I am happy with the result.\n\nWhat would help to improve the performance? Should we work more on the features or collect more data? The diagnosis suggests that we should work on the features instead of collecting more data.\nAdding new features such as height and weight might definetly be worth a try.\nI believe, however, that a true understanding, and hence, a better solution to the problem can be achived by acquiring deeper insights into the meaning and medical significance of the features. \nA quick google search and some skimming on wikipedia, however, reveals a rabbit hole which I don't want to enter at the moment. A proper solution, which might only be obtained after digging into the medical and biophysical processes, is beyond the scope of this simple exercise. \nIn other words: If I planned to put more effort into this exercise I would probably work on improving the features. If this were a real situation I would maybe look for consultation by a medical expert on CVD who knows the statistics of the problem.\n\nI also liked [Furkan Gulsen's idea](https://www.kaggle.com/codeblogger/step-by-step-support-vector-machine-svm). He uses SMOTE to generate new observations to \"un-skew\" the data.\n\nI would also like to mention that a medical doctor might prefer a model that outputs probabilities. The SVM is not the perfect choice if this was expected. After all we might prefer ensemble learning to build the ultimate classifier taylored to the problem at hand.\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read through my first Kaggle notebook. I learned a valuable lesson from this exercise: The importance of understanding the problem and the features. Machine Learning is just a tool. Understanding the problem, on the other hand, might be the key to achieve a proper solution.\n\n\nConstructive feedback of any kind is highly appreciated. The problem in this notebook was certainly quite interesting and I might come back to it in the future."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
