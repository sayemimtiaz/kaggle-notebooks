These group of people mainly have an average page value between [0,100].\n  \n  However, there are a wide range of customers who didn't buy anything (Revenue = False), however, show an average page value between [0,75], . This means their page value consists of only goal page values (no transaction value), i.e. some of the ideal purchase paths and goal pages we set before are not accurate, thus customers who clicked these pages didn't purchase as we expected.\n  \n- **In which range Bounce/Exit Rates could facilitate purchase behavior?**\n  \n  We could easily see a positive linear relationship between Exit Rate and Bounce Rate, i.e. customers who visit pages of higher average bounce rates are more likely to exit the website.\n  \n  To be precise, for customers who finally placed the order, most of them visited pages of bounce rate and exit rate between [0,0.075]\n  \n- **How does number of pages visited impact purchase behavior? And in which range duration on page could facilitate purchase behavior?**\n\n  Generally speaking, both product related and administrative pages (or page duration) have a range in which they could improve purchase intention; while  informational pages have little impact.\n  \n  For customers who placed the order, the approximate range of number of product related pages they visited is [15,45], the median around 30, meanwhile, the approximate range of duration on this type of page is [500,1500]s, the median around 900s; when it comes to administrative pages, the four figures are [0,5],2.5, [0,100]s,40s.\n  \n  However, considering some customers who didn't buy anything might also visited similar number of pages and stay same duration time, we finally target a even smaller group of people -- who seem to be 100% sure will purchase: they mainly visited approximately [30,45] product related pages and have a duration time between [1000,1500]s. In fact, this group of people will help us design new purchasing paths to guide customers visit proper number of pages and stay reasonable time on our website.\n\n\n\n***Strategy:***\n- We should re-design the purchase paths through: \n\n    1) assigning new page values, \n\n    2) naming new goal pages, \n\n    3) improving UI to guide customer to high value pages etc. \n> As we are in lack
