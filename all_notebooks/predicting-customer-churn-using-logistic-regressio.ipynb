In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the <b>most probable class</b> for that data point. For this, we use <b>Logistic Regression</b>.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n<font size = 3><strong>Recall linear regression:</strong></font>\n<br>\n<br>\n    As you know, <b>Linear regression</b> finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, <b>y</b>, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.). For example, simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n<br><br>\n$$\ny = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1  x_1 + \\theta_2  x_2 + \\cdots\n$$\n<br>\nand finds the values of parameters $\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2$, etc, where the term $\\theta_0$ is the \"intercept\". It can be generally shown as:\n<br><br>\n$$\nℎ_\\theta(𝑥) = \\theta^TX\n$$\n<p></p>\n\n</div>\n\nLogistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, <b>y</b>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n\nLogistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression function and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called the sigmoid function 𝜎:\n\n$$\nℎ\\_\\theta(𝑥) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) =  \\frac {e^{(\\theta\\_0 + \\theta\\_1  x\\_1 + \\theta\\_2  x\\_2 +...)}}{1 + e^{(\\theta\\_0 + \\theta\\_1  x\\_1 + \\theta\\_2  x\\_2 +\\cdots)}}\n$$\nOr:\n$$\nProbabilityOfaClass\\_1 =  P(Y=1|X) = \\sigma({\\theta^TX}) = \\frac{e^{\\theta^TX}}{1+e^{\\theta^TX}}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, ${\\theta^TX}$ is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), `exp` is the exponential function and $\\sigma(\\theta^TX)$ is the sigmoid or [logistic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\\&utm_source=Exinfluencer\\&utm_content=000026UJ\\&utm_term=10006555\\&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2021-01-01), also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve).\n\nSo, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability:\n\n<img\nsrc=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/mod_ID_24_final.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\">\n\nThe objective of the **Logistic Regression** algorithm, is to find the best parameters θ, for $ℎ\\_\\theta(𝑥)$ = $\\sigma({\\theta^TX})$, in such a way that the model best predicts the class of each case.\n","metadata":{"button":false,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Customer churn with Logistic Regression\n\nA telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors.
