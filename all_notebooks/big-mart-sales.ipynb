These are just my thoughts and you can come-up with many more of these. Since we’re talking about stores and products, lets make different sets for each.\n\n***Store Level Hypotheses:***\n\n1. City type: Stores located in urban or Tier 1 cities should have higher sales because of the higher income levels of people there.\n2. Population Density: Stores located in densely populated areas should have higher sales because of more demand.\n3. Store Capacity: Stores which are very big in size should have higher sales as they act like one-stop-shops and people would prefer getting everything from one place\n4. Competitors: Stores having similar establishments nearby should have less sales because of more competition.\n5. Marketing: Stores which have a good marketing division should have higher sales as it will be able to attract customers through the right offers and advertising.\n6. Location: Stores located within popular marketplaces should have higher sales because of better access to customers.\n7. Customer Behavior: Stores keeping the right set of products to meet the local needs of customers will have higher sales.\n8. Ambiance: Stores which are well-maintained and managed by polite and humble people are expected to have higher footfall and thus higher sales.\n\n***Product Level Hypotheses:***\n\n1. Brand: Branded products should have higher sales because of higher trust in the customer.\n2. Packaging: Products with good packaging can attract customers and sell more.\n3. Utility: Daily use products should have a higher tendency to sell as compared to the specific use products.\n4. Display Area: Products which are given bigger shelves in the store are likely to catch attention first and sell more.\n5. Visibility in Store: The location of product in a store will impact sales. Ones which are right at entrance will catch the eye of customer first rather than the ones in back.\n6. Advertising: Better advertising of products in the store will should higher sales in most cases.\n7. Promotional Offers: Products accompanied with attractive offers and discounts will sell more.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd #
