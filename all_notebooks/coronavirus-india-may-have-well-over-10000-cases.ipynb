For almost a month, no new cases was reported in India, however, on 8th March 2020, five new cases of COVID-19 in Kerala were again reported and since then the cases have been rising affecting 22 states and resulting in 4 deaths across the country as of 21st March 2020.\n\nOn 13th March 2020, India reported its first coronavirus fatality in the state of Karnataka, followed by 3 more deaths in other states. On 21st March 2020, confirmed COVID-19 cases has risen to **300s** with the state of Maharashtra bagging the maximum number of cases. As the number of confirmed cases rise in India, the question is do these numbers represent the **true** number of cases in India. \n\n### **Section 1**: Estimation of **realistic** number of cases in India\n\n### **Section 2**: Visual analysis True vs Confirmed cases & Takeaway\n\n### **Section 3**: Visual analysis of the spread in India (Detailed)\n\n\n**Credits**:\n*This article is inspired by the wonderful analysis done by Tomas Pueyo in his [medium blog](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca).\nData is obtained from reputable sources.

For Coronavirus, it is found to be around 6.2 days on average. For now, the same rate is assumed for the sake of analysis.\n\n* **Mortality rate** is assumed to be around 1%. \n    REASON:\n        Countries that are well prepared see a fatality rate of ~0.5% (South Korea) to ~0.9% (rest of China). Countries that are overwhelmed by the number of cases will have a fatality rate between ~3%-5%\n\n     In other words: Countries that act fast can reduce the number of deaths by a **factor of ten**. And that’s just counting the fatality rate.\n \n        Acting fast includes - massive testing, measures taken to enforce Lockdown/Social Distancing/Quarantine to reduce the rate of spread (Flatten the curve)\n\n* **Days to death** is again statistically determined to be around 17.3 days. For now, the same rate is assumed for the sake of analysis.\n\n\n## Section 1.2: Understand the Model with example\n \nThe number of deaths in a region can be used to guess the number of realistic current cases. As already mentioned above, the number of days from infection to death is found to be around 17.3. That means the person who died on 13th March 2020 in Karnataka probably got infected around 25th February 2020.\n\nThen, we know the mortality rate = 1%. That means that, around 25th February 2020, there were already around ~100 cases in Karnataka (of which only one ended up in death 17.3 days later).\n\nNow, use the average doubling time of 6.2 days. This means that, in the 17 days it took this person to die, the cases had to multiply by ~8 (=2^(17/6)). This means that, if you are not diagnosing all cases, **1 death today means 800 realistic cases today**.\n\nThis model has various assumptions/limitations, which will be discussed later. \n\n## Section 1.3: Estimation of True cases over time\n\nExpand to check out the code below to understand how the curve was plotted."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"death_df = df.copy()\ndeath_df_filtered = death_df[death_df.Deaths != 0]\n\n### Finding states with deaths\nstates = death_df_filtered.States.unique().tolist()\n#print(\"{}\\n\".format(states))\n\n####Number of days since Jan 30 2020\ni = df.iloc[[0]].Date.tolist()[0]\nj = death_df.iloc[-1].Date\nsize = int((j-i).days)+1\n#print(size)\n\n\nactual_total = np.zeros(size, dtype = int) ## Stores total realistic deaths\nactual_total_temp = np.zeros(size, dtype = int) ## Stores deaths of individual states and dates\n\n\n### Loop over each state (The onces with deaths)\ncount=0\nfor state in states:\n    temp = death_df_filtered[death_df_filtered.States == state]\n    #for death in temp\n    #deathi = temp.iloc[[0]].Deaths.tolist()[0]\n    a = temp.drop_duplicates(subset='Deaths', keep=\"first\").Deaths.tolist()\n    b = np.diff(a)\n    deaths = np.concatenate(([a[0]], b), axis=0)\n    #print(deaths)\n    \n    \n    ### Loop over each day for each state\n    for i in range(0, len(deaths)):\n        ### Go back 17.3 days\n        start = temp.iloc[[i]].Date -

There are a lot of variables to consider. For instance, age distribution in each country will also have an impact: Since mortality is much higher for older people, regions with aging population like in Europe will be harder hit on average than younger countries like India. There are more factors viz. weather - especially humidity and temperature, environmental, food and lifestyle habits. But it’s still unclear how this will impact transmission and fatality rates.\n\n* One more thing to consider is the number of tests per million people and number of hospital beds per 1000 people. India ranks among the lowest in both. Many cases and deaths may go unreported especially in rural areas due to lack of testing and self treatment phenomenon that exists in India\n\n**With the help of the model and the above considerations we can guess the number of true cases to be anywhere between 3000 - 6000+ as of March 21st.** \n\n### Best solution: Social distancing, Flattening the curve\n\nAround **20%** of cases require hospitalization, **5%** of cases require the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and around **2.5%** require very intensive help, with items such as ventilators or ECMO (extra-corporeal oxygenation).\n\nThe model predicts the number of cases only when Lockdown/Social Distancing/Quarantine is not enforced. Luckily our government has taken steps to implement various Lockdown measures viz. banning international flights and social distancing. If these measures are enforced and followed strictly, the number of cases may plateau at around 8000-10000+ and doesnt overburden our healthcare system. \n\nChina took some drastic steps. They locked down 15 cities apart from Wuhan and the result can be seen in the image
