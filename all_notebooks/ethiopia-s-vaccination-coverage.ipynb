The median age of the respondents was 28.4 (SD=±6.5) years old. Prevalence of BCG vaccination was 63.6 per cent (n=3373) and BCG vaccination coverage in urban residents was higher (88 per cent) than rural residents (57.3 per cent). Mothers' age between 20 up to 34 (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.48; 95 per cent CI 1.13 to 1.93) and between 35 up to 49 (AOR=1.83; 95 per cent CI 1.35 to 2.46) were more likely to vaccinate their child's than those mothers' age less than 20. Mothers settled in urban areas were two times more likely to vaccinate their child's than those living in rural areas (AOR=1.94; 95 per cent CI 1.45 to 2.60). Mothers with greater antenatal visits show higher BCG vaccination, Antenatal Care (ANC) 4 and above (AOR=3.48; 95 per cent CI 2.91 to 4.15). BCG vaccination is higher for mothers delivered at non-governmental organisation health facility than home (AOR=2.9; 95 per cent CI 1.69 to 4.96). Maternal occupation and wealth index also had a significant association with BCG vaccination.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nBCG vaccination coverage, in this study, was lower and determinant factors for BCG vaccination were residence, mother's age, place of delivery, mother's antenatal visit, wealth index and mother's occupation.https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/pt/mdl-30796120","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSuMrlQ9BrZEmA57v2jjlnRF_MK5wiq4NdwCw&usqp=CAU)\nslideserve.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Deaths in protests over singer death in Ethiopia.

They aimed to assess PCT levels at diagnosis of TB in young children in a low-burden setting. In a cross-sectional observational study,they assessed the value of PCT and other inflammatory markers (leucocyte counts, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) in the diagnosis of TB in pre-school children (< 6 years at diagnosis, n = 45), as compared with two control groups (pneumococcal pneumonia, n = 25; and healthy controls, n = 49).\n\nNormal PCT levels were observed at diagnosis of TB in most cases, while C-reactive protein values and leucocyte counts were slightly elevated when compared to healthy controls. All three inflammatory biomarkers were significantly higher in children with pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\nConclusions: In their study, PCT was not a useful diagnostic test for TB in young children. In a low-burden TB setting, PCT may be of some value in distinguishing pulmonary TB from pneumococcal pneumonia. What is Known: Diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis on clinical evidence is difficult, particularly in infants and small children;;; Studies in adults with tuberculosis have mostly reported normal procalcitonin levels at diagnosis. What is New: • In pre-scholars with tuberculosis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood cell counts were higher than in healthy controls, but procalcitonin was not. • Procalcitonin may be useful in the differential diagnosis of intrathoracic tuberculosis and pneumococcal pneumonia.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29374831/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.countplot(x=\"prevtx_data_available\",data=ethiopia,palette=\"GnBu_d\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.yticks(rotation=45)\n# changing the font size\nsns.set(font_scale=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(ethiopia['e_prevtx_eligible_hi'],linewidth=3,palette=\"Set2\",edgecolor='black')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df2 = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv')\ndf2.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Ethiopia = df2[(df2['Contry Name (Mandatory field)']=='Ethiopia')].reset_index(drop=True)\nEthiopia.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.countplot(x=\"Vaccination Timing (age)\",data=Ethiopia,palette=\"binary\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.yticks(rotation=45)\n# changing the font size\nsns.set(font_scale=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(Ethiopia['Are/were revaccinations (boosters) recommended?'],linewidth=3,palette=\"Wistia\",edgecolor='black')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Tuberculin Survey in Ethiopia, by M Azbite -PMID: 1405182\n\nFor planning and implementation of effective national tuberculosis control programme (NTP) in Ethiopia, it is essential to know the real magnitude of tuberculosis problem. Previous tuberculin survey carried out during the period from 1953 to 1955 revealed the annual risk of infection 3.0 per cent, and since then, there has been no survey. A new tuberculin survey was thus conducted during the period from December 1987 to April 1990. In order to get a sample of 47 previously BCG unvaccinated children, aged 6 to 10 years, selected from each 480 representative clusters of randomly selected 16 Woredas (districts), a total of 26,529 children, approximately 55 in each cluster, were given tuberculin intradermal injection, and the reaction was read in 26,269 children (99.0 per cent). A scar survey was done, and 23,695 had no BCG scar, while 2,574 (10.1 per cent) had BCG scar. Out of the former, 2,503 children (10.6 per cent) were positive, and the annual risk of infection thus calculated was 1.4 per cent. Out of the latter, 591 (23.0 per cent) were positive. The results of these two surveys indicate that tuberculosis showed decline in the past 37 years with the annual reduction rate of 2.2 per cent, however, the trend might change in the future due to present pandemic of HIV infection.\n\nPIP: Between December 1987 and April 1990, health workers administered a tuberculin test to 26,529 6-to-10-year-old children in 16 districts (Woredas) of Ethiopia to obtain a sample of 47 children who had not received a BCG vaccination earlier. They were able to read the reaction in 99 per cent of the children. 2574 (10.1 per cent) children had a BCG scar and 591 (23 per cent) of them tested positive for tuberculosis. 2503 (10.6 per cent) of the 23,695 children who did not have a BCG scar tested positive for tuberculosis. Tuberculin positivity was highest in Deder Woreda (Harrarghe Region) and lowest in Wuchale Woreda (Shoa Region) (27.9 per cent vs. 2 per cent). In fact, prevalence was higher in urban areas than rural areas, suggesting overcrowding's effect on transmission. The last tuberculin survey in Ethiopia occurred in 1953-1955, at which time the prevalence was much higher than in 1988-1990 (30 per cent vs. 10.6 per cent). In addition, the annual risk of infection was higher (3 per cent vs. 1.4 per cent). Between the 2 surveys the prevalence of tuberculosis fell at a rate of 2.2 per cent/year. Yet, the HIV infection pandemic in Ethiopia threatened that downward trend. The cost of chemoprophylactic drugs and lack of sufficient laboratory facilities posed a problem for Ethiopia's National Tuberculosis Control Programme.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1405182/\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR7pg6lctOmgZ4PohlXRydAraV6XNqO_6idmA&usqp=CAU)\ntbhivfoundation.org","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Das War's Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata @mpwolke","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
