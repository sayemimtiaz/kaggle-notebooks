In the context of the pandemic and in the post-pandemic, this problem can become worse.\n\nMaintaining the current pace, 17.5 per cent of young people who are now 16 years old will not complete basic education (pre-school, elementary and high school). The survey measured the total social cost of each young person without basic education in four dimensions:\n\n1- employability and remuneration of young people; 2- effects that young people's remuneration has for society, which are called externalities; 3- longevity with quality of life; and 4 - violence.\n\nInitially, the survey calculated how many young people will not complete basic education, maintaining the current pace. Then, what would be the consequences, in monetary values, per young person in the four dimensions. Finally, it's estimated the total cost for the country.\n\nThe result is that, annually, the country loses R$ 372 thousand per young person who does not finish basic education. This is because young people who have completed basic education spend, on average, more of their productive lives occupied and in formal jobs, with higher remuneration; have higher quality life expectancy - it is estimated that each young person with basic education will live four years longer than a young person who has not finished school -; and they tend to be less involved in violent activities, such as homicides - the estimate is that evasion represents a loss of 26 per cent of the value of a young person's life.\nhttps://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://monitormercantil.com.br/brasil-perde-r-214-bi-por-ano-com-evasao-escolar-de-jovens&prev=search&pto=aue","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRz_iGBqgdWHde0aY7hgMl5RRXY_13U5FWgiQ&usqp=CAU)who13.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/education-and-covid19/education_COVID-19.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# categorical features\ncategorical_feat = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].dtypes=='O']\nprint('Total categorical features: ', len(categorical_feat))\nprint('\\n',categorical_feat)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets find unique values in each categorical features\nfor feature in categorical_feat:\n    print('{} has {} categories.

For rural migrants without nearby family, childcare can be a major problem. However, an ELC placement was a dream come true for Thuy. Then, over a month ago, the preschool closed as part of Vietnam’s efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThis week Thuy shared a note to her 3-year-old daughter Van with ELC teachers.
