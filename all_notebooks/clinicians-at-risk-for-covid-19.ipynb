It is possible to get a feel for the breakdown by specialty/occupation by using online lists set up as memorials to healthcare workers who have died of COVID-19.  The data is likely incomplete and biased, but may suggest a direction for better studies.\n</p>\n<p>\nOffhand, I would have expected Emergency Medicine personnel to dominate the list.  In data for several countries, nurses, healthcare assistants and support workers always comprise a large share of the fallen.  Interestingly, though, General Practitioners are the specialty among physicians, not Emergency Medicine.  Admittedly this may be partly to do with how I have coded the occupations, but I don't think this entirely accounts for this effect.  It may be worth looking into ways to protect General Practitioners better."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n<p>\nTo do a proper job on this task, one would need highly detailed data on each clinician infected with COVID-19.

Also, it's not clear that even the experts, like the US CDC, has good data on this (see below).\n</p>\n<p>\nA fallback might be to do a careful search of local newspapers and published obituaries.  This is a big job.
