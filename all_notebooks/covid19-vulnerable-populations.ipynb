The authors explored COVID-19 treatment service options at the patient level (diagnosis, management, location and level of treatment) and measures to reduce nosocomial transmission (cohorting patients, protecting healthcare workers). Lastly, they proposed key indicators for monitoring COVID-19 health services.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Crisis-affected Populations: large household sizes, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation;  camp or urban overcrowding; higher disease severity; untreated co-morbidities; limited access to health services. </font>\n\nThe virus is expected to cause even more pernicious effects in crisis-affected populations, defined here as forcibly displaced people within or across national borders and non-displaced persons affected by armed conflict, exceptional food insecurity and/or natural disasters, and in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThese populations may face higher COVID-19 attack rates due to large household sizes, inadequate hygiene and access to safe water and sanitation, and camp or urban overcrowding; they may also experience higher disease severity and poorer outcomes due to untreated co-morbidities and limited access to health services.\n\nhttps://conflictandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13031-020-00325-6"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://peguisfirstnation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vulnerable-eng-1-1-702x336.jpg)peguisfirstnation.ca"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot\nimport seaborn\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"COVID-19 treatment services may prove particularly challenging in settings with low baseline healthcare capacity, fragile supply chains and limited access to testing. \n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Principles and objectives of COVID-19 treatment services</font>\n\nPrinciples and objectives of COVID-19 treatment services: Beneficence, Non-maleficence ( keep to a minimum the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection for clinical and support staff.),  Justice (efficiency: Against finite resources;; equity of resource allocation;; equity of access (proactively address barriers to accessing care ))\n\nObjectives:\n\nSafeguard the delivery of essential non-COVID-19 health services;\n\nProtect frontline healthcare and support workers from infection;\n\nAllocate resources optimally and equitably, while minimising opportunity costs (e.g. diversion of resources from more cost-effective interventions);\n\nReduce COVID-19 case-fatality and morbidity through safe, dignified and effective COVID-19 health services including palliative care where appropriate.\nhttps://conflictandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13031-020-00325-6"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadsdisadvantagecsv/disadvantage.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"utf8\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'disadvantage.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Approach for decision-making</font>\n\nThe authors propose a structured approach, coordinated across humanitarian actors, local health authorities and communities, to take decisions on which package of COVID-19 health services is appropriate locally.\n\nThey suggest that COVID-19 health services at facility level should only be considered as a third priority, if resources are still available after securing essential health services  and enacting COVID-19 preventive measures within community and home-based COVID-19 case management. \n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Community preferences.

This is partly due to ageism, or the discrimination of older adults based on age, which has been prevalent in research, policy, and the media.\n\nTraditional media (such as newspapers, television, and radio) have long reinforced ageist stereotypes by often portraying older adults as a burden to society.\n\nDuring the pandemic, this phenomenon has also been observed in social media (online platforms for sharing user-generated content). COVID-19 has accelerated changes in the way we share information, with a shift towards social media use by governments, news outlets, and researchers. \n\nWhile this has speeded up the transmission of data, it has also led to the dissemination of misinformation and negative messages.\n\nNegative social media messages about COVID-19 and aging often characterize older adults as helpless and expendable individuals.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">“#BoomerRemover” Twitter hashtag: Hate speech and Intergenerational Resentment.  </font>\n\nExisting hate speech and intergenerational resentment can be exemplified by the “#BoomerRemover” Twitter hashtag (user-generated metadata term), which was widely shared in social mediaat the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nTo understand the dissemination of ageist messages in social media, the authors group conducted a qualitative analysis of the content English-language tweets about COVID-19 and older adults posted in the ten days following the pandemic declaration .\n\nTheir findings showed that almost a quarter of tweets downplayed the importance of COVID-19 because it was deadlier among older individuals, and that 14% contained offensive content or jokes.

As we move online in response to COVID-19, it is imperative that administrators and teachers attend to the potential for this exacerbation and work to mitigate it at both the levels of policy and practice.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">TPD (Teacher Professional Development) for OBL (Online and Blended Learning)</font>\n\nIt is vitally important that research on TPD (teacher professional development) for OBL (online and blended learning) attend to inequities in education. \n\nThe TPD for OBL framework does not explicitly address this question; however, educational equity is, arguably, a worldwide issue.\n\nTherefore, any framework for supporting teacher professional development must attend to issues of equity. \n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Minoritized Communities: Black People, Women (in STEM subjects), People with Disabilities,LGBTQ community and other vulnerable populations</font>\n\nQuestions should focus on addressing the development of culturally sustaining pedagogies for marginalized and minoritized communities, including people of color, girls and women (in STEM subjects), people with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ community and other vulnerable populations.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">TPD for OBL: Supporting equity or Reproducing the status quo? </font>\n\nMoreover, teachers’ voices should become more prominent in the development of TPD for OBL, such that their rights and expertise are respected. And while teachers’ autonomy has become increasingly circumscribed in the classroom due to neoliberal reform movements, they are still highly influential actors in the lives of children. TPD for OBL should assist teachers in critically analyzing the new medium, and how it can be used to either support equity or reproduce the status quo.\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-020-09864-4#citeas"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['challenge'] = 'Challenge'\nchallenge = df.truncate(before = -1, after = 15)\nchallenge = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(challenge, source = 'challenge', target = \"Study\", edge_attr = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">Individual-level demographic and co-morbid factors associated with mortality of COVID-19. </font></mark></b>\n\nThe Use of Penalized Regression Analysis to Identify County-Level Demographic and Socioeconomic Variables Predictive of Increased COVID-19 Cumulative Case Rates in the State of Georgia\n\nAuthors: Holly L.

Public Health 2020, 17(21), 8036; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218036\n\nSystemic inequity concerning the social determinants of health has been known to affect morbidity and mortality for decades. Significant attention has focused on the individual-level demographic and co-morbid factors associated with rates and mortality of COVID-19.\n\nHowever, less attention has been given to the county-level social determinants of health that are the main drivers of health inequities.\n\nTo predict COVID-19 cumulative case rates at the county-level in Georgia, the authors performed a sequential, cross-sectional ecologic analysis using a diverse set of socioeconomic and demographic variables.\n\nLasso regression was used to identify variables from collinear groups. Twelve variables correlated to cumulative case rates with an adjusted r squared of 0.4525. \n\nAs time progressed in the pandemic, correlation of demographic and socioeconomic factors to cumulative case rates increased, as did number of variables selected.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Health Disparities affecting vulnerable populations</font>\n\nFindings indicate the social determinants of health and demographic factors continue to predict case rates of COVID-19 at the county-level as the pandemic evolves.

Dedeoglu -  22 October 2020 https://doi.org/10.1002/pra2.289\n\nThe advent of COVID‐19 has resulted in an unprecedented level of digital global communication. With social distancing practices, there is an increased volume of online activities and also increased production of online information from both organizations and individuals.\n\nThe use of social networking has increased dramatically as people use these tools as a substitute for in‐person social gatherings. Social media has likely also become a substitute for person‐to‐person information seeking, which makes up half of all information seeking , and is particularly important for disadvantaged groups.\n\nHigher education is a clear example of the changes wrought by COVID‐19. Universities and institutes have transitioned to virtual campuses, where all communication, teaching and learning, and support for students occur online.\n\nInternational students, while not the only group of affected students, have particular challenges around information: some are seeking information about their host country and their home simultaneously, and some are attempting to integrate into a university community without ever setting foot on campus. \n\nThe potential of digital access and equity challenges. If the communication strategies of governments, service providers and universities do not consider these needs, equity issues will arise.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Digital Access and Equity for Vulnerable Populations such as Migrant Groups or International Students</font>\n\nWith the world moving the bulk of its activities online during a Pandemic, digital access and equity and effective engagement need addressing more urgently than ever, particularly for vulnerable populations such as recent migrant groups or international students.\nhttps://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pra2.289"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['addpop'] = 'Addressed Population'\naddpop = df.truncate(before = -1, after = 10)\naddpop = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(addpop, source = 'addpop', target = \"Matches\", edge_attr = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20, 20)\npos = nx.spring_layout(addpop)\ncolor = plt.cm.Reds(np.linspace(0, 15, 1))\nnx.draw_networkx_nodes(addpop, pos, node_size = 15000, node_color = color)\nnx.draw_networkx_edges(addpop, pos, width = 3, alpha = 0.6, edge_color = 'pink')\nnx.draw_networkx_labels(addpop, pos, font_size = 20, font_family = 'sans-serif')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.grid()\nplt.title('Matches', fontsize = 40)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Olga Belitskaya https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/sequential-data/comments\nfrom IPython.display import display,HTML\nc1,c2,f1,f2,fs1,fs2=\\\n'#eb3434','#eb3446','Akronim','Smokum',30,15\ndef dhtml(string,fontcolor=c1,font=f1,fontsize=fs1):\n    display(HTML(\"\"\"<style>\n    @import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=\"\"\"\\\n    +font+\"\"\"&effect=3d-float';</style>\n    <h1 class='font-effect-3d-float' style='font-family:\"\"\"+\\\n    font+\"\"\"; color:\"\"\"+fontcolor+\"\"\"; font-size:\"\"\"+\\\n    str(fontsize)+\"\"\"px;'>%s</h1>\"\"\"%string))\n    \n    \ndhtml('Be patient.
