They even deployed a mask supply app service to inform and alert local pharmacies mask supply situation. \n* **Hong Kong**: Initially mask was encouraged for people with symptoms along with returning travelers from high risk areas. Later, government started seeing wearing mask as one of the serious measures. They started distributing two face masks per day to seniors at elderly homes. Furthermore, all citizens were requested to wear masks at all times. \n* **China**: Scaled up production (and even created new factories in record breaking times) to provide as much mask as possible. \n* **Czech Republic**: Chronological information about when 1%, 10%, and 100% citizens in public are wearing masks is available.\n* **Slovakia**: At first, mask was recommended for all public transport operators.
