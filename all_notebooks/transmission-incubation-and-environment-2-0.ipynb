The challenege, however, is that the number of scientific papers created is large and the papers are published very rapidly, making it nearly impossible for scientists to digest and understand important data in this mass of data.\n\n**SOLUTION:** Create an unsupervised scientific literature understanding system that can take in common terms and analyze a very large corpus of scientific papers and return highly relevant text excerpts from papers containing topical data relating to the common text inputed, allowing a single researcher or small team to gather targeted information and quickly and easily locate relevant text in the scientific papers to answer important questions about the new virus from a large corpus of documents.\n\n**APPROACH:** The newest implementation outlined:\n- open the meta CSV file in a dataframe - 44K entries\n- drop the duplicates by abstract\n- loop (comprehension) a list of lists for the keyword for searches. eg. search=[['incubation','period','range']]\n- stem the keywords so incubation becomes incubat etc.\n- append indpendently - different variations of corona references - (covid, cov, -cov, hcov) to the keywords avoids pulling older research\n- query function in pandas to query the above terms with the keywords - the abstract has to have all the keywords and at least one of (covid, cov, -cov, hcov) \n- drop the duplicates in the df again after the queries\n- caclulate a relevance score for all the abstracts in the query result df\n- raw_score = total count of the keywords in the abstract\n- final_score = (raw_score/len(abstract))*raw_score\n- sort the df on the final_score ascending=False (best on top)\n- drop rows with a relevance score < .02\n- parse the relevant abstarcts into sentences split('. ') works well.\n- test if keywords are in the sentences\n- if sentence has all keywords, it is added to the df for display.\n- if you are seeking statistics in the data, adding % to the search terms works well\n- df with search results displayed in HTML - currently limiting results to 3 for ease of scanning\n\n**Pros:** Currently the system is a very simple **(as Einstein said \"make it as simple as possible, but no simpler\")**, but quite effective solutiuon to providing insight on topical queries.  The code is easy to read and simple to understand.\n\n**Cons:** Currently the system requires some human understanding in crafting keyword combinations, however, the recent relevance measure changes and stemming of keywords, have made it so the keywords can be very close to the NL questions and return very good results.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# keep only docsuments with covid -cov-2 and cov2\ndef search_focus(df):\n    dfa = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('covid')]\n    dfb = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('-cov-2')]\n    dfc = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('cov2')]\n    dfd = df[df['abstract'].str.contains('ncov')]\n    frames=[dfa,dfb,dfc,dfd]\n    df = pd.concat(frames)\n    df=df.drop_duplicates(subset='title', keep=\"first\")\n    return df\n\n# load the meta data from the CSV file using 3 columns (abstract, title, authors),\ndf=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/metadata.csv', usecols=['title','journal','abstract','authors','doi','publish_time','sha','full_text_file'])\nprint (df.shape)\n#drop duplicates\n#df=df.drop_duplicates()\n#drop NANs \ndf=df.fillna('no data provided')\ndf = df.drop_duplicates(subset='title', keep=\"first\")\ndf=df[df['publish_time'].str.contains('2020')]\n# convert abstracts to lowercase\ndf[\"abstract\"] = df[\"abstract\"].str.lower()+df[\"title\"].str.lower()\n#show 5 lines of the new dataframe\ndf=search_focus(df)\nprint (df.shape)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import functools\nfrom IPython.core.display import display, HTML\nfrom nltk import PorterStemmer\n\n# function to stem keyword list into a common base word\ndef stem_words(words):\n    stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n    singles=[]\n    for w in words:\n        singles.append(stemmer.stem(w))\n    return singles\n\ndef search_dataframe(df,search_words):\n    search_words=stem_words(search_words)\n    df1=df[functools.reduce(lambda a, b: a&b, (df['abstract'].str.contains(s) for s in search_words))]\n    return df1\n\n# function analyze search results for relevance with word count / abstract length\ndef search_relevance(rel_df,search_words):\n    rel_df['score']=\"\"\n    search_words=stem_words(search_words)\n    for index, row in rel_df.iterrows():\n        abstract = row['abstract']\n        result = abstract.split()\n        len_abstract=len(result)\n        score=0\n        for word in search_words:\n            score=score+result.count(word)\n        final_score=(score/len_abstract)\n        rel_score=score*final_score\n        rel_df.loc[index, 'score'] = rel_score\n    rel_df=rel_df.sort_values(by=['score'], ascending=False)\n    #rel_df= rel_df[rel_df['score'] > .01]\n    return rel_df\n\n# function to get best sentences from the search results\ndef get_sentences(df1,search_words):\n    df_table = pd.DataFrame(columns = [\"pub_date\",\"authors\",\"title\",\"excerpt\",\"rel_score\"])\n    search_words=stem_words(search_words)\n    for index, row in df1.iterrows():\n        pub_sentence=''\n        sentences_used=0\n        #break apart the absracrt to sentence level\n        sentences = row['abstract'].split('.
