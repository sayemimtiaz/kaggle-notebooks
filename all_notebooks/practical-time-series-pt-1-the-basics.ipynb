How does he solve it?\n1. start with the nail that's completetely in - that's the more interesting case\n2. once done, hammer the other all the way - to reduce to an already solved case\n\nI warned you it was bad - but there is an analogy to how time series theory handles the problem of nonstationarity. \n\nTo define things more formally, a stationary time series is one whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. This implies that parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time.\n\nSince stationarity is an assumption underlying many statistical procedures used in time series analysis, non-stationary data are often transformed to become stationary. A trend stationary process is not strictly stationary, but can easily be transformed into a stationary process by removing the underlying trend, which is solely a function of time; the same holds true for a stationary process with an added cyclical component. \n\nThe core idea is that it's much easier to model dynamic behavior over time if the statistical properties do not change: oscillations happen around the same level, the amplitude does not change too much etc (in other words, the probability distribution of $X_t$ is the same as the distribution of $X_{t+h}$)- such models are well understood. Algorithms are likely to yield better predictions if we apply them to stationary processes, because we do not need to worry about e.g. concept drift between our training and test sets. \n\n\nIf we are dealing with a process that does not adhere to those characteristics, we can either try and capture them directly or transform it in such a manner that it can be considered stationary. \n\n \nBelow we plot a few examples of stationary and non-stationary series, starting with the simplest non-trivial stationary series: Gaussian white noise.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"xseries = pd.DataFrame(data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000), columns = ['noise'] )\nxseries.plot()\nprint()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-10T20:56:43.342728Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-10T20:56:43.343374Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-10T20:56:43.420687Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-10T20:56:43.343261Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-10T20:56:43.41963Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_acf(xseries['noise'], lags = 25)\nprint()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T09:12:44.96734Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T09:12:44.967751Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T09:12:45.232537Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T09:12:44.967713Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T09:12:45.231457Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_pacf(xseries['noise'], lags = 25)\nprint()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T09:12:48.737631Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T09:12:48.738003Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T09:12:48.981513Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T09:12:48.737972Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T09:12:48.980567Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For a slightly more interesting example (of non-stationary behavior), we can examine the passengers dataset:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Non-stationary example\nseries = pd.read_csv(CFG.data_folder + 'passengers.csv')\nseries['date'] = pd.to_datetime(series['date'])\nseries.set_index('date').plot()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T09:12:51.979226Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T09:12:51.979574Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T09:12:52.228577Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T09:12:51.979543Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T09:12:52.227387Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The stationarity of a series can be checked by examining the distribution of the series: we split the series into 2 contiguous parts and compute the summary statistics like the mean, variance and the autocorrelation.
