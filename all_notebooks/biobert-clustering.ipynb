The idea of embedding is to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The embedded data are also in a lower dimension as compared to only using classical methods, such as count or tfidf vectorizations Once we have the embeddings, we use them as latent variables for further processing, eg clusterisation, similarity computation with embeded queries... Here, we focus on the aforementioned tasks.\n\nNow comes the question of what embedding to be used. We started of doing a literature research on the most recent NLP embeddings, and BERT [Attention Is All You Need\n](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) comes into our mind. Further research led us to SciBERT [SciBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Scientific Text\n](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10676) and BioBERT. We have therefore performed a comparison between BERT, sciBERT and bioBERT embeddings. We obtained more relevant results using bioBERT (results not included in this notebook).

However the word \"aerodynamics\" is absent, it is broken down into 4 subwords: electro ##dy ##nami ##cs where these subwords are present in the vocab. \n- Some mandatory tokens must be included such as [CLS] stands for class and often included at the beggining of a sentence and [SEP] stands for separation for the next sentence prediction task, as the underlying model is an attention-based bidirectional RNN structure.\n- The output embeddings have a fixed size of (x, 768), where x is the number of tokens which we set to a maximum length according to the corpus."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load BioBERT model\nBioBERT model can be obtained from this [GitHub](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert) page.

We have performed clustering on the datapints and have used PCA to reduce the number of dimensions and visualize them. With word cloud, we have been able to get an idea of the topic of each cluster. And finally, we build a demo to test out two settings, one embedding using title and the other one using both title and abstract. The returned results seem to be a little bit off.\n\n# Next steps\n\nUsing BioBERT embeddings directly to identify the semantic similarity has shown some caveats: it is very sensitive to length and returned results are not necessary very relevant.
