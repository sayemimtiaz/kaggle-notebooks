This is a method that presents easily recoverable clusters and an intuitive visualization. Unsupervised clustering techniques have been used effectively to categorize and/or classify other data.\n\nWe choose a hierarchical approach because documents are non-lattice, non-real valued data that do not live in Euclidean space. Conventional clustering methods would require some Euclidean embedding for documents, which would require even more validation. Furthermore, this method accounts for the overlapping/concentric structure of topic clusters in document-based data. In this notebook, we extract TF-IDF features to get a representation of the document at a high level instead, and then apply a hierarchical clustering algorithm using the Ward objective function.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setup and Utility functions"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# for clustering\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import ward, dendrogram, fcluster, single, complete\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\n\n# feature extraction\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer \n\n# data\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# viz\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# other\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom copy import deepcopy\nimport time\n\nINPUT_DIR = '/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'\nMAX_TITLE_LEN = 70\n\nnltk.download('wordnet')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# from xhlulu's kernel\n\ndef format_name(author):\n    middle_name = \" \".join(author['middle'])\n    \n    if author['middle']:\n        return \" \".join([author['first'], middle_name, author['last']])\n    else:\n        return \" \".join([author['first'], author['last']])\n\n\ndef format_affiliation(affiliation):\n    text = []\n    location = affiliation.get('location')\n    if location:\n        text.extend(list(affiliation['location'].values()))\n    \n    institution = affiliation.get('institution')\n    if institution:\n        text = [institution] + text\n    return \", \".join(text)\n\ndef format_authors(authors, with_affiliation=False):\n    name_ls = []\n    \n    for author in authors:\n        name = format_name(author)\n        if with_affiliation:\n            affiliation = format_affiliation(author['affiliation'])\n            if affiliation:\n                name_ls.append(f\"{name} ({affiliation})\")\n            else:\n                name_ls.append(name)\n        else:\n            name_ls.append(name)\n    \n    return \", \".join(name_ls)\n\ndef format_body(body_text):\n    texts = [(di['section'], di['text']) for di in body_text]\n    texts_di = {di['section']: \"\" for di in body_text}\n    \n    for section, text in texts:\n        texts_di[section] += text\n\n    body = \"\"\n\n    for section, text in texts_di.items():\n        body += section\n        body += \"\\n\\n\"\n        body += text\n        body += \"\\n\\n\"\n    \n    return body\n\ndef format_bib(bibs):\n    if type(bibs) == dict:\n        bibs = list(bibs.values())\n    bibs = deepcopy(bibs)\n    formatted = []\n    \n    for bib in bibs:\n        bib['authors'] = format_authors(\n            bib['authors'], \n            with_affiliation=False\n        )\n        formatted_ls = [str(bib[k]) for k in ['title', 'authors', 'venue', 'year']]\n        formatted.append(\", \".join(formatted_ls))\n\n    return \";

That is; it is unclear 1) how a human would divide this dataset into topics, and 2) if our discovered  clusters map onto human \"concepts\" well.\n* **Single, hard assignment.** As opposed to other EM-style distribution estimation algorithms or LDA, which yield a \"soft\" assignment by assigning a distribution over a set of latent variables, this method only assigns each document unequivocally to a single cluster.\n* **Distance metric.** Tf-idf has been shown to be successful on various tasks. However, the distance metric here is the cosine-distance between the tf-idf vectors of two documents. Let's call shingles (n-grams)  with high tf-idf scores \"important.\" Here I am assuming 1) that tf-idf ideally captures \"important\" n-grams in the corpus, and that 2) two closely related articles will have similarly co-occuring \"important\" n-grams.\n* **Space.** Calculating a pairwise distance matrix will invariably take O(n^2) memory. This will likely not scale as the set of documents grows.\n* **Feature Extraction.** This is very close to a CBOW (continuous bag of words) style model. The document-based representations here account for very little context (accounted for in the n-gram feature extraction only). To see why this might be a problem, one paper might use a particular set of words in an endorsing context; another paper might use that same turn of phrase in a critical context (e.g. counterargument (?), related work, etc.). This is left out of our feature extraction.
