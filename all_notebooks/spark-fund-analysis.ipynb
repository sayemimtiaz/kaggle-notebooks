The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.\n\n\n## Business and Data Understanding :\nSpark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:\n\n    - It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment\n\n    - It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in. For the analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country\n    \n## Business objective: \nThe objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'. (Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing.
