Customers with lower income have bought this model, median being 46K, \nindicating this might be a very affordable model.\n2. The customers have rated their fitness level an average of 3 and they use this model almost 3-4 days a week, indicating most of customers are casual starters.\n3. 44.4% of product sales came from this model, indicating this model has a good customer base.\n4. Customers are quite young, in the age group of median 26 years.\n5. Customers are having 14-16 years of education.\n6. Females and single males prefer this model, indicating this model is not gender specific.\n7. Miles expected to run is on lower side (mean: 85), again indicating the basic requirements of the customers.\n    \n#### TM498:\n1. Customers with comparatively low to medium income have bought this model, median being 49K, indicating this might be an affordable mid-level model.\n2. The customers have rated their fitness level an average of 3 and they use this model 3 days a week, indicating most of customers are casual starters.\n3. 33.3% of product sales came from this model, indicating this model has the second best customer base.\n4. Customers are quite young, in the age group of median 26 years.\n5. Customers are having 14-16 years of education.\n6.

Miles expected to run is on lower side (mean: 85), again indicating the basic requirements of the customers.\n    \n#### TM798:\n1. Customers with comparatively higher income have bought this model, median being 76.5K, indicating this might be a costly high-level model.\n2. The customers have rated their fitness level an average of 4.5 and they use this model 4-5 days or even 7 days a week, indicating most of customers are serious health-conscious people, or athletes.\n3. 22.2% of product sales came from this model, indicating this model has the lowest customer base.\n4. Customers are of various age. groups, median is 27 years, however, there are a lot of customers aged 40-48 years.\n5. Customers are having 16-18 years of education. This and point(4) indicates customer base is not only young people.\n6. This modelis very popular in male customers, although there are very few female customers as well, indicating this model although not gender specific, most of the features attract males customers.\n7.

Since our female customers prefer the TM195 and TM498 compared to TM798 model, we should run promotional offers on the TM195 and TM498 models for the female customers on Mother's day/Women's day etc. Also, we can run campaigns during those specific days to spread awareness on health and fitness. We can also endorse some female athletes to promote these two models.\n    \n2. We can brand the TM195 model as budget-friendly, TM498 model as mid-range, and TM798 model as professional treadmills.\n    \n3. We can endorse some athletes to promote TM798 to increase it's customer base, since it is the least sold model.\n    \n4. We can run promotional offers on TM798 time-to-time, as it is of high price (assumed as people with more income buy this model), so than we can encourage our mid-budget customers to give this model a thought. This strategy might reduce profit margin per model, but on long run, should increase the sales of this model. Considering this model might be the most profitable model, in long run, with discounted price and higher customer base, this should provide overall higher profit margin.\n    \n5. Since our primary customer base is of age 23-33 years, we can run promotional campaigns in schools and colleges to emphasize on health and fitness, and encourage the youngsters and their parents to consider buying this model. This should expand our customer base for the people below 23 and above 33 age as well.\n    \n6. We can also check with gyms if they are interested in upgrading their treadmills or buying new treadmills in bulk with some discount.","metadata":{}}]}
