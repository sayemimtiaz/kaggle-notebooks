Air pollution in India is a serious issue, ranking higher than smoking, high blood pressure, child and maternal malnutrition, and risk factors for diabetes. At least 140 million people breathe air 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit  and 13 of the world's 20 cities with the highest annual levels of air pollution are in India.  Air pollution contributes to the premature deaths of 2 million Indians every year. In urban areas, most emissions come from vehicles and industry, whereas in rural areas, much of the pollution stems from biomass burning for cooking and keeping warm. In autumn and winter months, large scale crop residue burning in agriculture fields – a low cost alternative to mechanical tilling – is a major source of smoke, smog and particulate pollution. India has a low per capita emissions of greenhouse gases but the country as a whole is the third largest after China and the United States. A 2013 study on non-smokers has found that Indians have 30% lower lung function compared to Europeans.\n\nThe Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was passed in 1981 to regulate air pollution and there have been some measurable improvements. However, the 2016 Environmental Performance Index ranked India 141 out of 180 countries.\n\n\nIn 2015, Government of India, together with IIT Kanpur launched the National Air Quality Index. In 2019, India launched 'The National Clean Air Programme' with tentative national target of 20%-30% reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 2024, considering 2017 as the base year for comparison. It will be rolled out in 102 cities that are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\n\n\n\n\n![](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-OJ027_POLDET_G_20160607063315.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven of the world's 10 worst polluted cities are in India, a new study has revealed, with wider South Asia home to scores more blighted by dirty air.\n\nGurugram, a city about 30km southwest of India's capital New Delhi, had the worst pollution levels globally in 2018, the study published on Tuesday by AirVisual and Greenpeace showed.\n\nThree other Indian cities, and Faisalabad, in Pakistan, made up the top five. Out of the 20 most polluted cities worldwide, 18 were in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\nNew Delhi, home to more than 20 million people, was ranked at 11, making it the world's most polluted capital, ahead of Dhaka, in Bangladesh, and Kabul, in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n![](http://cdni0.trtworld.com/w960/h540/q75/22324_IND-2017-11-12-India-new-delhi-air-pollution-AFP_1510451129110.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\"Air pollution steals our livelihoods and our futures,\" Yeb Sano, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said in a statement. \"In addition to human lives lost, there's an estimated global cost of 225 billion dollars in lost labour, and trillions in medical costs,\" he added.\n\n\"We want this report to make people think about the air we breathe, because when we understand the impacts of air quality on our lives, we will act to protect what's most important.\""},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.core.display import HTML\nHTML('''<script>\ncode_show=true; \nfunction code_toggle() {\n if (code_show){\n $('div.input').hide();\n } else {\n $('div.input').show();\n }\n code_show = !code_show\n} \n$( document ).ready(code_toggle);\n</script>\nThe raw code for this IPython notebook is by default hidden for easier reading.\nTo toggle on/off the raw code, click <a href=\"javascript:code_toggle()\">here</a>.''')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://images.mapsofindia.com/my-india/2016/05/10-most-polluted-cities-of-india-graphic.jpg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" <h1>Contents</h1>\n  \n1. **Introduction**\n2. **The Data**\n3. **The Cleaning**\n4. **Data Summary**\n5. **Study Of Air Quality In India**\n6. **Introduction to No2**\n7. **Introduction to So2**\n8. **visualization of Data**\n9. **Location-wise Gas Data**        \n10. **All Gases Comparison**\n11. **Deaths From Air Pollution Worldwide Data**\n12. **Conclusion**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\n\n\"Air pollution refers to the condition in which the existence of toxic substances in the atmosphere, generated by various human activities and natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, results in damaging effects on the welfare of human beings and the living environment\" (Omasa 2002). As stated here, this is a very serious problem which is difficult to treat due to the nature of airborne particles.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), outdoor air pollution is classified into four main categories: particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Additionally, air pollution is further divided into primary and secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants are released directly into the atmosphere from a source, where secondary pollutants occur as a result of complex chemical reactions taking place from two pollutants reacting with each other (Kibble and Harrison 2005).\n\nIn the 1970's, the United States government formed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to growing concern of our impact on the environment. Ever since then, an entire industry has opened, focusing to remediate what was done before as well as maintain a sense of responsibility for what we do to the environment now. Unfortunately, since this is a relatively new concern, there is very little history of how air pollution has been dealt with in the past. Through current research, we are now making history.\n\n<h2>Source of air Pollution</h2>\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Sources_of_Air_Pollution.png)\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Air Quality Index Meter"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://www.sparetheair.com/assets/aqi/PM2017.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1> 2.Import the  dataset</h1>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom tkinter import *\n\n\n\n####..........Data cleaning.......###\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\nDT=pd.read_csv(\"../input/data.csv\",encoding = \"latin1\",low_memory = False)\ndf=pd.DataFrame(DT)\n\n\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>3.Cleaning the dataset</h1>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nRemoving NaNs Looking at the dataset head, we can conclude that the following columns:\n\nstn_code agency sampling_date location_monitoring_agency do not add much to the dataset in terms of information that can't already be extracted from other columns.

Air pollution in India is caused by fuelwood and biomass burning, burning of crop residue in agriculture fields on a large scale, use of adulterated fuel, emission from vehicles and traffic congestion.\n\nIndia is the third largest in the emission of greenhouse gases after China and the United States. The severity of air pollution is so much that life expectancy among Indians on an average reduces by 3.4 years while among the residents of Delhi it reduces by almost 6.3 years.\n\nIn this section, we will assess the quality of air in India based on indicators like Household Air Quality and Outdoor Air Quality affected by PM10, PM2.5, Ozone (O3), Nitrogen oxides (NOX), Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and Carbon monoxide (CO).\n\nIt has been found that, around the world, more deaths occur due to poor air quality than water. The World Health Organization (WHO) gives a guideline to measure air pollution in a region according to which it had fixed the limit of particulate matters in the air.\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization considers air unsafe when average exposure to any of these matters exceeds the limit. According to the 2016 EPI, more than 3.5 billion people – half of the world’s population – are exposed to unsafe air quality which also includes 75% of India’s population.\n\nHowever, Indian air quality standard limits the safe exposure to PM2.5 up to 40 μg/m3 and a recent study reveals that 50% population living in 45% districts of India is exposed at PM2.5 concentration beyond 40 μg/m3.The World Health Organization considers air unsafe when average exposure to any of these matters exceeds the limit. According to the 2016 EPI, more than 3.5 billion people – half of the world’s population – are exposed to unsafe air quality which also includes 75% of India’s population.\n\nAs some indicators are common for indoor as well as outdoor pollution, to understand clearly, we need to first know what these indicators really are.\n\nParticulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture consisting of varying combinations of dry solid fragments, solid cores with liquid coatings and small droplets of liquid. These tiny particles vary greatly in shape, size and chemical composition, and can be made up of many different materials such as metals, soot, soil, and dust.\n\nParticulates are highly carcinogenic and have been classified in Group I carcinogen because of their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstreams. They can also cause permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, and premature death.\n\nPM10 is roughly one-seventh the diameter of a normal human hair. PM10 is a major component of indoor air pollution and forest fires. It consists of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, and black carbon; it may also include concentrations of natural windblown dust. PM10 is harmful to health because it can block and inflame nasal and bronchial passages, causing a variety of respiratory-related conditions that lead to illness or death. The European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), published in 2013, stated that with every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM10, the rise of 22% in the lung cancer was observed.\n\nPM2.5 is often produced by biomass and fossil fuel combustion as well as natural sources such as windblown dust and volcanic activity. It is often considered even more dangerous to human health because of its ultrafine size and ability to cause several diseases related to lung and heart. With every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 concentration, 36% increase in lung cancer was also observed.\n\nOzone (O3), an important ingredient of smog, is a highly reactive and unstable gas capable of damaging the linings of the respiratory tract that can cause lung inflammation, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, coughing and exacerbation of respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and asthma. Long-term exposure has been linked with chronic respiratory illnesses. Approximately 142,000 people died as a result of exposure to ozone in 2010 – an increase of about 6% since 1990.\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOX) are one of the principal pollutants that result from fossil fuel combustion. It helps in the formation of ozone and also causes several chronic diseases.\n\nSulphur dioxide (SO2) is a colourless gas with a very sharp odour formed with the combustion of sulphur-based coal and oil. Sulfur dioxide can form Sulphuric acidic upon combination with water and can cause acid rain. SO2 can also cause respiratory and cardiac diseases which lead to increased mortality rate.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless gas, produced mostly by vehicles, fuel combustion boilers and incinerators. It can cause headaches, visual impairment, reduced cognitive functioning and ability, and reduced ability to perform complex tasks. Very high levels can also result in unconsciousness and eventually death."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://whichairpurifier.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pollution-levels-recorded-by-us-conulates-june-2015.jpg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3> 5.1 Every Single state Air pollution  Gase values</h3>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#print('Every Single state Air pollution  Gase values')\ndf.groupby(['state', 'type']).count()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>5.2 Adding all gas values in single column</h3>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# defining columns of importance, which shall be used reguarly\nVALUE_COLS = ['so2', 'no2', 'rspm', 'spm', 'pm2_5']\n\n#..............State...........#\n\nstate=df.groupby(['state'],as_index=False).mean()\n\nstate\n\ndf['total']=state.sum(axis=1)\ndf.fillna(0.0,inplace=True)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>5.3  The State with highest amount of air-pollution is !<h2>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#.............

12 Conclusion</h1>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nVarious reports like ‘The Environment Performance Index 2016’, ‘The Global Green Economy Index (GGEI) 2016’, ‘Ambient Air Pollution Database’, ‘WHO, May 2016’, ‘Clear the air for children: The impact of air pollution on children UNICEF 2016’ and others suggest that India is one of the most polluted countries in the world.\n\nIndia, in spite of being better in GDP per PPP than many countries, has done very poorly in the 2016 EPI.\n\nIn fact, if we compare the 2016 EPI reports with 2016 Global Peace Index (GPI) in which India (coincidentally and interestingly) again ranks 141, we observe that India has done worse than various less peaceful countries like Iraq, Nigeria Libya, Ukraine, Egypt, Syria and several others in overall EPI.\n\nThis brings us to the construe the fact that it is the willingness of the government rather than its GDP or stability to act against pollution.\n\nNo major initiative has been taken by the Indian Government to tackle air pollution.\n\n‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ (Clean India Mission) was launched by the government of India on October 2, 2014, to reduce pollution but exactly one week before, on September 25, 2014, the government also launched the ‘Make in India’ initiative which hopes to make India a production hub.\n\nProduction will also mean putting our already vulnerable environment further at risk. The government needs to understand that ‘Swachh Bharat’ and ‘Make in India’ cannot go hand in hand.\n\nRather, the Central government, along with the State governments, should create and launch strict policies and measures to cope with the menace called air pollution.\n\nIndia, on October 2, 2016, ratified the Paris Agreement with the aim to deal with greenhouse gases emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance starting in the year 2020.\n\nThe declaration, as given by the government, reads: “The Government of India declares its understanding that, as per its national laws; keeping in view its development agenda, particularly the eradication of poverty and provision of basic needs for all its citizens, coupled with its commitment to following the low carbon path to progress, and on the assumption of unencumbered availability of cleaner sources of energy and technologies and financial resources from around the world; and based on a fair and ambitious assessment of global commitment to combating climate change, it is ratifying the Paris Agreement.”\n\nIndia has also recently unveiled the largest solar panel facility in the world at Kamuthi, Tamil Nadu which has a capacity of 648 MW and covers an area of 10 sq km. Let’s hope that government follows its agreement and work towards making the world much cleaner and safer place to live in."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
