There are ways around this though. Another option is to compute features regarding each actor/actress (such as avg number of votes in his/her previous movies) and include those interval variables in a model. In this case we do something different, and try to learn representations for each actor/actress (100 length vectors) using **Word2Vec**.\n\nEven though Word2Vec was originally designed to produce word embeddings, you can use it for any case in which the context matters. In this case, we use actors' and actresses' names (or imdb id's) as the words that would usually be the input of a **Word2Vec** model, and the other actors and actresses who appeared in the same movies, as *context words*."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline, make_union\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, f1_score, fbeta_score, precision_score, recall_score\nfrom hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp, STATUS_OK, Trials\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import ParameterGrid\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\nimport csv\nfrom gensim.models.callbacks import CallbackAny2Vec\nfrom itertools import groupby\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nimport gensim\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport os\nimport random\npd.options.display.max_columns = 999","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"PATH = Path('/kaggle/input/imdb-dataset/')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load Data"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def load_data(start_year, min_minutes, min_votes):\n    title_basics = pd.read_csv(PATH / 'title.basics.tsv' / 'title.basics.tsv', sep='\\t')\n    title_ratings = pd.read_csv(PATH / 'title.ratings.tsv'/ 'title.ratings.tsv', sep='\\t')\n    title_basics.genres = title_basics.genres.apply(\n                        lambda x: x.split(',') if ((type(x)!=float) & (x!=r'\\N')) else ['no_genre'])\n\n    title_basics.runtimeMinutes = (\n     title_basics.runtimeMinutes.apply(lambda x: np.nan if not x.isdigit() else x).astype(float)\n                                )\n    \n    title_basics = title_basics[\n        title_basics.titleType.isin(['movie'])\n        & ~title_basics.runtimeMinutes.isna()\n        & (title_basics.runtimeMinutes <= 3.5 * 60)\n        & title_basics.genres.apply(lambda x: 'Short' not in x)\n        ]\n    \n    movies = pd.merge(title_basics, title_ratings, on='tconst', how='left')\n    movies['startYear'] = movies['startYear'].apply(lambda x: np.nan if x == r'\\N' else int(x))\n    \n    # MY CONDITIONS:\n    movies = movies[movies.startYear > start_year].dropna(subset=['averageRating'])\n    movies = movies[movies.runtimeMinutes >= min_minutes]\n    movies = movies[movies.numVotes>=min_votes]\n    return movies","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I impose a couple of conditions to make the dataset more manageable:\n\n1- Only load movies from after 1960, as I suspect films older than that have a different voting pattern.

This is a bit weird and make some plots look like something that is not quite what one expects of a probability density. But does it make sense? Maybe it's not so crazy to predict that a movie will either get very low attention, or a lot of it, and the probability of receiving average number of votes or anything in between is low.
