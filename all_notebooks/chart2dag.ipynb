Right now, the City has embedded Career Path charts in PDF files.  A DAG is a special data structure that is more efficient than PDF images.  It looks like a family-tree.\n\n#### Challenges\n\nConvert the Career Path images from the PDF files to a DAG.  Unfortunately, the Career Paths were not designed using high contrast colors.  A dark orange box with black text means the position is only open to City employees.  A blue box with black text means new hires can also apply.\n\n#### Solution\n\nRather than attempting to develop custom PDF parser for legacy PDFs, I took a novel approach.  I used on open-source, optical character recognition tool that is supported by Google.  It is called, [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).  Using a neural network, Tesseract can read the chart and output a raw text file.  Unfortunately, Tesseract cannot read the text through the dark colors.  So, I stripped the color from the chart.  Then, I wrote a script that converts this raw text into a DAG.  I attached this DAG to the Job Bulletin CSV file.  I even added a column called NEXT_PROMOTION for each JOB_CLASS_TITLE.\n\nThere's a bit more work to do but here is a proof of concept using the Public Relations Career Path:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nImage(\"../input/careerpathdata/PR.png\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Preprocessing to get input text\n\nFor this submission, I chose to focus on one goal:  reading text from charts and creating a DAG.  I converted the Public_Relations_Specialist.pdf into PR.png and cropped the image.  You don't have to crop the image but it was convenient for this example.  I stripped the orange and blue color from the chart and ran Tesseract using the command line interface:\n\n```\ntesseract PRcrop.png PR.txt\n```\n\nTesseract output this file:\n\n```\nDevelopment and\nMarketing Director\n\nPublic Information\nDirector\n\nPrincipal Public Relations\nRepresentative\n\nPublic Relations\nSpecialist\n``` \n\nUsing this raw text, I created a DAG for the career path. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''\nScript:  JBR_DAG.py\nPurpose: Generate a directed acyclic graph for Career Paths and compute the next promotion for job class titles\nExample: Public Relations Career Path\nNOTICE:  Run this once after you run LAJobs2CSV.py because each time you run this, it will merge the DAG dataframe with the JOB BULLETIN CSV resulting in multiple indexes in the csv file\n'''\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\nfrom graphviz import Digraph\nfrom graphviz import Graph\n\ndef generate_edges(graph):\n    ''' edges connect nodes '''\n    edges = []\n    for node in graph:\n        for neighbour in graph[node]:\n            edges.append((node, neighbour))\n    return edges\n\ndef find_isolated_nodes(graph):\n    \"\"\" returns a list of nodes that don't have any edges \"\"\"\n    isolated = []\n    for node in graph:\n        if not graph[node]:\n            isolated += node\n    return isolated\n\ndef create_graph(graph,edges,nodes,graphName):\n    a = []\n    dot = Digraph(format='png')\n    for node in nodes:\n        dot.node(node[0], node[1])\n    for edge in edges:\n        dot.edge(edge[0][0], edge[1][0])\n    dot.render(graphName,view=True)\n\ndef no_letters(k,v):\n    abcs = re.search('[a-zA-Z]',v)\n    if not abcs:\n        return int(k)\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nchartNames = ['Accounting','Admin','Animal','Bind','PR']\nchartNames = ['PR']\ncsvList = []\n\nfor chartName in chartNames:\n        \n    file = '../input/careerpathdata/'+chartName+'.txt'\n\n    k = 1      # row counter\n    row = {}   # dictionary with line and line number for each line in the OCR text\n    csvRow = {}\n    with open(file) as f:\n        for line in f:\n            line = line.strip(\"\\n\")\n            row[str(k)] = line\n            k += 1\n            \n    otherRows = [(no_letters(k,v)) for k,v in row.items()]\n    textRows = [(str(i+1),row[str(i+1)]) for i,x in enumerate(otherRows) if x == 0]\n\n    # Sometimes career path charts format node names across two lines.
