What is less obvious is that these rates - also called *crude rates* - do not allow for a proper comparison between countries. Suicide rates, as we shall see, vary considerably depending on demographic groups, so for a country as a whole one has to take into account its current demographic structure.

More often than not, however, **we see a positive change, concerning many countries, all age groups above 15, and especially men** (the reason why we don't see a huge improvement among women is that women already had relatively low suicide rates to begin with). The vast majority of the dots are either near zero (meaning no change) or below zero (meaning fewer deaths per capita than in the previous decade).\n\nTo quantify that notion, I put these results into three broad categories:\n* Increase in suicide rates.

This trend is visible in virtually all broad age categories in both sexes**. The use of median suicide rate as representative of a decade (for a given country, age and gender) minimizes the risk that the observed effect is spurious due to randomness. I wish to all of us that this trend continues throughout the whole 21st century.\n\nAs for the reasons behind the observed change, there are many possibilities, which I would describe in broad strokes as follows:\n1. Mechanisms - intended or not - that make commiting suicide harder.\n2. Real sociological, psychological etc. factors keeping people away from thinking about suicide in the first place.\n3.
