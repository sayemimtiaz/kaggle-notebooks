The size of subsets created for bagging may be less than the original set.\n\n- Bagging had each model run independently and then aggregate the outputs at the end without preference to any model.\n\n- Bagging can be depicted with the following diagram -"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Bagging](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a5e99250fc4dadd401726a04f4fe2086)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **2.2 Boosting** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.2\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n- Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model.\n\n- In this technique, learners are learned sequentially with early learners fitting simple models to the data and then analyzing data for errors. In other words, we fit consecutive trees (random sample) and at every step, the goal is to solve for net error from the prior tree.\n\n- When an input is misclassified by a hypothesis, its weight is increased so that next hypothesis is more likely to classify it correctly. By combining the whole set at the end converts weak learners into better performing model.\n\n- Boosting is another ensemble technique to create a collection of models. \n\n- In this technique, models are learned sequentially with early models fitting simple models to the data and then analyzing the data for errors.\n\n- In other words, with boosting, we fit consecutive trees and at every step.\n\n- Boosting can be depicted with the following diagram -"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Boosting](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-652eb915c12a1440bb8bb4acd8329ddd)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **3.

Thus, we should correct the mistakes of the first model. \n\n- This is the core of gradient boosting, and what allows many simple models to compensate for each other’s weaknesses to better fit the data.\n\n- Gradient Boosting is an iterative procedure. So, we will repeat the above process over and over again. Each time we fit a new model to the gradient of the error of the updated sum of models.\n\n- So, gradient boosting is a method for optimizing the function F, but it doesn’t really care about h (since nothing about the optimization of h is defined).

For instance, in the above image, how could we add another layer to the (age > 15) leaf. \n\n- A ‘greedy’ way to do this is to consider every possible split on the remaining features (so, gender and occupation), and calculate the new loss for each split.

Now, if we consider the potential loss for all possible splits to create a new branch we have thousands of potential splits and losses.\n\n- XGBoost tackles this inefficiency by looking at the distribution of features across all data points in a leaf and using this information to reduce the search space of possible feature splits.\n\n- Although XGBoost implements a few regularization tricks, this speed up is by far the most useful feature of the library, allowing many hyperparameter settings to be investigated quickly. \n\n- This is helpful because there are many hyperparameters to tune which are designed to limit overfitting."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **4.
