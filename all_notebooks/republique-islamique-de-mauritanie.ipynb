Efficacy is measured in controlled clinical trials, whereas effectiveness is measured once the vaccine is approved for use in the general population. From these we can identify the proportion of vaccinated people we would expect to be protected by the vaccine.\n\nHerd immunity (also called community immunity) is an important mechanism by which the larger community is protected. For some diseases, if enough people are immune then transmission of the disease is reduced or eliminated. This is particularly so for diseases such as rubella and pneumococcal disease. High vaccine coverage must be maintained in order to prevent the disease re-entering the population.\n\nNo vaccine is 100% effective, a small percentage of people are not protected after vaccination and for others the protection may wane over time. Also, some people are unable to be vaccinated due to certain conditions such as immune suppression. Maintaining immunity in those around these people protects them from disease.https://www.immune.org.nz/vaccines/efficiency-effectiveness#:~:text=Vaccine%20efficacy%20and%20effectiveness%20are,use%20in%20the%20general%20population.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(\"No vaccine is 100% effective\")\ntokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#No vaccine is 100% effective.\n\nTo make vaccines safer than the disease, the bacteria or virus is killed or weakened (attenuated).
