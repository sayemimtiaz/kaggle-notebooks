What we're going to do now is apply a reinforcement learning technique known as a multi armed bandit in a business case scenario.\n\nThe name multi armed bandit comes from a type of slot machine. You pull the lever, bleep bloop and either the machine pays out some money, or it doesn't.\n\nYou're faced with 6 slot machines with different probabilities of a payout. If you knew which one had the highest likelihood of a payout you would just stick with that one, right? \nThe aim of a multi armed bandit is find the action with the greatest amount of reward, while still earning reward during this exploration phase.\n\nThis method of determining probability distrobutions while exploiting the most successful can be used in a huge variety of industries.\n* **Clinical trials**- Exploration is akin to identifying an optimum treatment, while the exploitation occurs when treating patients efficiently as rapidly as possible from when the trial begins.\n* **Game design**- Creating and experimenting with variants of a game mechanic, more players will be allocated to the variant with the greater level of success, thus ensuring maximized user interaction throughout the experiment.\n\nHowever, the most used application of a multi armed bandit is as a turbo charged A/B test for product and advertising.\n\nA/B testing is by far the most common way to gage user preference. The main problem of traditional A/B tests is that it is split into two separate stages exploration and **then** exploitation. \n\nWheras multi armed bandits combine both these phases, ie gives you the ability to earn a reward whilst still trying to find the optimum action.\n\nThe goal of this next exercise to optimize the performance of your companies display ads. You make money everytime a user interacts with the ad. Your collegue has whipped up 10 variations of the ad, let's see if we can find the highest performing variant!\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c9125e40cc63e98447f5ce0155324c18b22b79b6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Multi-armed-bandit](https://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/multiarmedbandit.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"53d8b6d6d33aae268a4c0b716c76ea14987c06c1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport random","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"653295400d22a2cbc8c0b270c507470005e9c89f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We're going to have to do a bit of pretending here, the data we will be working with is a static file (not streamed data).
