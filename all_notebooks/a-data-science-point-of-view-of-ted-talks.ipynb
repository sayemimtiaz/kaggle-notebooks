As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan and Bill Gates.\n\nTed, which operates under the slogan 'Ideas worth spreading' has managed to achieve an incredible feat of bringing world renowned experts from various walks of life and study and giving them a platform to distill years of their work and research into talks of 18 minutes in length. What's even more incredible is that their invaluable insights is available on the Internet for free.\n\nSince the time I begin watching TED Talks in high school, they have never ceased to amaze me. I have learned an incredible amount, about fields I was completely alien to, in the form of poignant stories, breathtaking visuals and subtle humor. So in this notebook, I wanted to attempt at finding insights about the world of TED, its speakers and its viewers and try to answer a few questions that I had always had in the back of my mind.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install transformers\n!pip install torch\n!pip install pyshorteners\n!pip install xlrd\n!pip install wikipedia","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"81d127aa-551f-4fdb-98fb-8dca2d2faea1","_uuid":"f5aee6a6d370cdfcfecf9d4d2f3d65445be12b0b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport json\nfrom pandas.io.json import json_normalize\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n\n\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport nltk\nimport re\nimport datetime\n\n#UrlLib for http handlings\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport urllib.request\nimport re\n\nimport urllib.request  \nimport bs4 as BeautifulSoup\nimport nltk\n\n#from string import punctuation\n#from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n#from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n#from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\n\nfrom os import path\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator\n\nimport urllib.request  \nimport bs4 as BeautifulSoup\nimport nltk\nfrom string import punctuation\nimport wikipedia\n\n#For the next version \nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer\n\nimport torch\nimport json \nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Config\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9b5a1aee-5f65-4330-98c7-fec99eadec2f","_uuid":"4d28c92cf4f9819412d6f1280193f6f349dd9aaa","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"month_order = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']\nday_order = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0fdd99e6-e0a7-497f-bdd0-346e333f3cda","_uuid":"b388e751b5b37848577c772746edff862d1a8611"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data has been obtained by running a custom web scraper on the official TED.com website.

You can read more about it here.\nIt achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple NLP tasks like summarization, question answering, machine translation etc using a text-to-text transformer trained on a large text corpus. More details here: [Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer)\nToday we will see how we can use huggingface’s transformers library to summarize any given text. T5 is an abstractive summarization algorithm. It means that it will rewrite sentences when necessary than just picking up sentences directly from the original text.\n\nThe key point to note in the code above is that we prepend our text with “summarize: ” before passing it to the T5 summarizer.\nIf you look in the paper, all we need to do for other tasks is to prepend our text with their corresponding string eg: “translate English to German: ” for translation task.\n\n\n@article{2019t5,\n  author = {Colin Raffel and Noam Shazeer and Adam Roberts and Katherine Lee and Sharan Narang and Michael Matena and Yanqi Zhou and Wei Li and Peter J.
