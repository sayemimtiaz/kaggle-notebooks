Which locations/regions are more affected by the virus, and in which places are new cases likely to be appear? What areas should healthcare professionals focus their resources and efforts on? \n\nVisualizing this data in an intuitive way provides clearer insights on transmission behavior and patterns. In this project, we used data from Allegheny County, PA. We wanted to focus our efforts on creating a local-level tool at a finer resolution to track coronavirus spread, and using official county data was an excellent way to gather the specific data we needed. Another reason we chose Allegheny County in particular was because we were collaborating with the local county health department and UPMC Emergency Medical Services to better coordinate COVID-19 response.\n\nTraditional methods of viewing geographic data, such as a choropleth map, are often not specific or visually effective enough for county-level data. Additionally, simply showing one map for each day makes it hard to reason about patterns over time, but animating it also introduces the problem of sudden jumps in color or distribution between frames, since human vision is particularly wired to understand continuous motion. Altering the traditional choropleth, we performed a series of interpolations to more effectively bring out patterns and trends. The result is a cognitively-engaging visualization that makes it ergonomically efficient for humans to observe dynamic patterns in data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nImage(filename='/kaggle/input/images/cbar40.png', width=1000, height=1000)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/591876/1085258/alleghenyT.gif?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587272665&Signature=dM2dbhSjcZ5r0jwu%2BywOJHodrMkQB1TzPFJ19CcaFK55%2BTcU3Ps8K3jtCwKn%2BEZ4fZ2xaEA6Z2ophmqlVy9eJHP%2B4KjbeIDLnBVsKHT%2FuDO7zPgZv4GmPNGkpeVHnn8zyKKhuLEJCdN%2BTgARwMLaOdzr1qQl07w9QsL7VpwXBCwy%2FCQPYP7%2FykCOln4rwXw%2FyLRxTPRCwJNlYDzAwPgU8aQoOcbocoHenH%2F40PGN%2BRB36Aarx9R6okSl6iF3Hs5c5GAi4HE1fPDHfZogXHh2nIbNbqVckt%2FV8KUybauak3BkC5kA%2Fwl8AwB%2BTC7WFtOmvk3PYq6%2B2B91UBwDbC6zcA%3D%3D)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From this animation, compared to one made with a choropleth (shown later) it becomes much easier to see where exactly new cases are appearing and how the case distribution changes over time.

We also plan on further developing the radial graph mentioned here, adding more detail and animation to visualize transmission on a global scale.\n\nWe hope that our efforts in developing this type of map make it easier in the future to better understand and predict where COVID-19 transmission and cases are most prevalent, as well as better coordinate healthcare response by providing geographic information.
