Over the span of 14 years, it has reached 286 million **active users** and 130 million **premium subscriptions**. An average user listens to Spotify for 25 hours in a month, 44% of the users dance with their souls through this app on a **daily basis**. These statistics clearly suggest that for a significant part of the world, Spotify is the go to address for the music.\n\nIn this notebook, I will try to , list the most popular artists, investigate the kinds of music we are listening to the most and genre behaviours over the years while questioning the genre definitions. For this analysis, I will use [Spotify Dataset 1921-2020](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) that contains over 160 thousand tracks, gathered by fellow Kaggler [Yamac Eren AY](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay), using [Spotify Public API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). If you're curious about popular songs and artists, general reasons behind Spotify usages, learn what a stop track is (I didn't know it before), and genre definitions, this might be an enjoyable notebook for you.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans #Clustering\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA #Dimension Reduction\n\nimport plotly.express as px #Interactive Plots\nimport plotly.graph_objs as pgo #Interactive Plots\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots #Interactive Plots\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nimport random\nfrom math import floor","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a>\n## Basis for Exploratory Data Analysis\n In this section, we'll briefly take a look at the features of the dataset, highlighting a few of them in order to have a better understanding for the rest of the analysis. It contains various features of a song both in technical perspective such as tempo, key, loudness, and also historical records such as release date, popularity. Dataset owner Yaman already has clear definitions for these features, and further details can be always found on [Spotify API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/). In order to access them a bit more practically, I will present these definitions and their scales here.\n\n<a id=\"2.1\"></a>\n### <u>Feature Definitions</u>\n\n**1.\t<u>artists</u>:** The list of artists of the song.\n\n**2.\t<u>danceability</u>:** Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n\n**3.\t<u>duration_ms</u>:** The duration of the track in milliseconds.\n\n**4.\t<u>energy</u>:** Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. (Float)\n\n**5.\t<u>explicit</u>:** The content item is explicit and the user’s account is set to not play explicit content.\nAdditional reasons may be added in the future. Note: If you use this field, make sure that your application safely handles unknown values.\n\n**7.\t<u>instrumentalness</u>:** Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n\n**8.\t<u>key</u>:** The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.\n\n**9.\t<u>liveness</u>:** Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n\n**10. <u>loudness</u>:** The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n\n**11. <u>mode</u>:** Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n\n**12. <u>name</u>:** Name of the song.\n\n**13. <u>popularity</u>:** The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.\nThe popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.\nGenerally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity. Note that the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few days: the value is not updated in real time.\n\n**14. <u>release_date</u>:** The date the album was first released, for example “1981-12-15”. Depending on the precision, it might be shown as “1981” or “1981-12”.\n\n**15. <u>speechiness</u>:** Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\n\n**16. <u>tempo</u>:** The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n\n**17. <u>valence</u>:** A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\n**18. <u>year</u>:** Year information extracted from release_date.\n\n**19. <u>genres</u>:** A list of the genres used to classify the album. For example: “Prog Rock” , “Post-Grunge”. (If not yet classified, the array is empty.)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"main_df = pd.read_csv('../input/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks/data.csv')\nmain_df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see how these numeric metrics distributed."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"main_df.drop(['key','mode','year','explicit'],axis=1).describe().transpose().sort_index()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that most of them are in between 0 and 1, except *duration_ms*, *loudness*, *popularity* and *tempo*.

Moreover, it also presents hidden or forgotten gems to users like myself who like to discover beautiful pieces and more silent stories. One thing we can say for certain is that Spotify is responsible for the majority of people's mood each day. It is the most popular medium to choose when we users need a break from the outside world, or when we want to party and socialize with others. The best friend of humankind found its way in Spotify to keep shaping our lives. In this study, we've seen many popular artists and songs. Learned that back in the 50s and 60s, even tracks on the vinyl records took a break, unlike most of us in these fast-paced days. Genres are not only defined by their audio similarities and structures but mostly by their cultural effects and artists' philosophical views. \n\nThank you for your time dear Kaggler and big thanks to [Yamac Eren AY](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay) for this beautiful dataset. Keep kaggling with music and with curiosity."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
