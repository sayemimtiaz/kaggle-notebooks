Note that this is only true since we have standardised the variables. Of course the weights themselves have a straightforward interpretation in terms of how the associated feature affects the predicted outcome. In particular, increasing feature $i$ by 1 (i.e. 1 standard deviation) multiplies the odds by $exp(w_i)$, where $w_i$ is the corresponding weight.

If we want to know which risk factors are the most impactful on one's chance of developing heart disease, it is really this second kind of feature importance that we want. There are other drawbacks that are specific to each model:\n\n1. Random forest:\n    \n    * Mean decrease in gini tends to overestimate the importance of continuous and high cardinality categorical data.\n    * It also underestimates the importance of highly correlated features.\n        \n2.

Also, since we computed the importance of each feature via cross validation, this represents the importance the feature plays in generalisation. It is also a very inuitive technique. \n\nHowever, it deals with correlated data poorly. This is because when we permute a particular feature, we end up with combinations of features which are very unlikely or impossible. For example, if we had a dataset consisting people heights and weights and we permuted one of these features, then the permuted data set could have instances where weight = 45kg, height = 200cm, which is obviously unrealistic. So for our data, the feature importances for ST depression, max heart rate and exercise induced angina should be taken with a grain of salt. \nWe can see that the standard deviations are very high on both models.

We then average of all such possible subsets. There are many theoretical properties of Shaply values which make them attractive. In particular, they are the only measure of feature importance which satisfy  the following four properties simultaneously (we state these informally).\n* Efficiency: The Shapley values of all features for a given prediction sum to the output of the model (i.e. the probability that target = 1).\n* Symmetry: Any two features which have the same effect on the prediction are given the same Shapley value.\n* Linearity: The Shapley value of a collection of features is the sum of the Shapley values of the features.\n* Dummy: A feature which has no effect on the prediction has a Shapley value of 0.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We only compute the shap values for the random forest, and not logistic regression.

There is definitely something strange going on with the chest pain type variable. All types of chest pain excluding asymptomatic actually reduce the chance of heart disease. A likely cause for this is that all the patients in this data set experience some type of chest pain, and that three of those are relatively less indicative of heart disease. If this data set included many people with no chest pain at all, then we would expect all forms of chest pain to increase the chances of heart disease.

However, for age we notice quite a bit of variability from patient to patient. The other notable property of the age PDP is that it is not linear. In fact, as people reach their 60's, heart disease rates plateau or even drop. This could be because of several things:\n* Survivors bias: It may be the case that if you are someone who is medically predisposed to heart disease (e.g. because of an underlying heart condition), you are less likely to live as long. \n* It may also be because factors which improve a person's longevity will necessarily reduce their chance of contracing heart disease. \n* It could be do to with the issue PDPs have with correlation. From the correlation matrix, we can see that age has a fair degree of correlation with max heart rate; young people tend to have a higher heart rate. It could be the case then, that the data for a young person with a high heart rate gets permuted to look like an old person with high heart rate, and this high heart rate reduces their probability of contracting heart disease relative to what you would expect. This is a combination which does not occur naturally in the data, and so it is reasonable that the model makes unusual predictions.\n* Of course, there is also the chance that this is a byproduct of not having enough data."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can investigate whether or not correlation is the cause by looking at the SHAP dependency plot, since Shapley values are robust to correlations in the data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"for feature in important_features:\n    fig= plt.figure(figsize = (8,5))\n    ax = plt.subplot(111)\n    shap.dependence_plot(feature, shap_values[1], X_test_prepped,\n                        feature_names = encoded_features,\n                         interaction_index = None, ax = ax, show = False\n                        )\n    mean = X_train[feature].mean()\n    std = X_train[feature].std()\n    #Unscale x values\n    def unscale_ticks(x, pos):\n        return ('%.1f' %(x*std + mean))\n    ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mticker.FuncFormatter(unscale_ticks))\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This dependency plot based on Shapley values confirms the shape of the dependencies on these features.
