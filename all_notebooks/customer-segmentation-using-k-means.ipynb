This can better be achieved if we can segment the customers into different groups that reflect the similarities among the customers in each group. The goal of the segmentation is to foresee the needs of customers, get to know their interests, lifestyles, priorities and learn their spending habits so that to maximize the value of customers to the business. Customer segmentation has many advantages for the businesses which include:\n\n- ***Price Optimization:*** Understanding the customers and their financial status will help to pace up with price optimization \n\n\n- ***Enhanced Competitiveness:*** More the customer attention and more will be the revenue generated and this would in return enhances company competitiveness in the market. If the company can segment the market, it is well known to the customers and the company can come up with new products and optimize the existing products according to the changing preferences of the customers\n\n\n- ***Acquisition and Retention:*** A personalized connection with the customers helps a company to win satisfied customers. Better segmentation of the customers will lead to better relationships with the prospective customers. About 75% of satisfied customers are more likely to stay with a company\n\n\n- ***Increased Revenues:*** By fine tuning the marketing strategies will help generate more revenues because users will more likely to purchase when they are delivered exactly what they need. Personalized and segmented Emails increase the liklihood that more Emails will be opened. Infact the more Emails are opened, the more sales will be made. Successful marketing not only require knowledge about who your customers are but also where exactly they are in the buying process and customer segmentation based on such information ensure that the marketing campaigns are truly effective\n\n\n\n\nFor the given Dataset, I will perform the exploratory data analysis with the help of customer segmentation. Customer segmentation will be carried out with the help of K-Means alogorithm. At the end of analysis I would like to answer some questions by gaining some insights from the data, which are as follows:\n\n\n***1. What are the statistical characteristics of the customers?***\n\n***2. What are the spending habits of the customers?***\n\n***3. Are there some products which need more marketing?***\n\n***4. How the marketing can be made effective?***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=font-size:150%;text-align:left;color:#0000FF> In this Notebook, I have included the following </h1><a id=0></a>\n                                                                   \n<h1 style=font-size:140%;text-align:left;color:#0000FF>   1.

What are the spending habits of the customers?***\n\nCustomers have spent more on wine and meat products. Those without children have spent more than those having children. Singles are spending more than the one's with the partners. Middle aged adults have spent more than the other age groups. Store shopping is the preferred channel for purchasing among the customers. Web and Catalog purchasing also have potential\n\n***3. Are there some products which need more marketing?***\n\nSweets and Fruits need some effective marketing. Company needs to run promotions for these products in order to increase the revenue from these products. Baskets of the least selling products combined with the most selling products can be effective. \n\n***4. How the marketing can be made effective?***\n\nAs a marketing recommendation give coupons to the old and high spending customers. Market the cheap and on-offer products to the low income and low spending customers. Web purchasing has some potential.
