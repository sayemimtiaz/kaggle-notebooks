A significant enough number of users seem to put different meaning into `wishlist` and `like`. Proposing both options may help understanding a user's tastes and intentions better. These different lists of products can then be used to recommend more appropriate products.\n  - Thus this result should not only be limited to C2C platforms. Regular e-commerce shops (B2C) may also incorporate `like` and `wishlist` buttons to improve their knowledge of their users and prospects. By relying only on items added to the `cart`, a business would miss the greater potential of more specific targeting.\n  \n\n  **Sellers**\n- socialNbFollow***ers*** and `productsSold`\n- __socialNbFollow*ers*__ and `productsListed`\n\n  This shows that people who publish more are more likely to get followers. This is not an absolute rule, since the correlation is only around 0.5.\n  Practically, we can interpret it saying that some sellers may propose clothes that do not suit the dominant tastes.\n  \n  **How to use this insight from a business's point of view ?**\n  \n  Right of the bat, we cannot reach any clear conclusion using only this aggregated data, i.e. there are several ways this correlation could be interpreted, and one would need specifically collected data to test which hypothesis is the most likely.\n\n  For instance, the correlation between `followers` and `sold products` can be seen in two main ways (or a combination of both):\n  \n  1. a seller gets followers by selling products (and thus being granted a badge of \"trusted\" seller, which in turn will get him/her to sell more).\n  \n  2. It is also possible that in C2C platforms, successful sellers first get subscribers and then, by showing them quality products, they earn the client's trust and turn cold prospects into their clients and fans.\n  \n    For a C2C business, the latter hypothesis would the most promising. It would imply that a C2C company could earn more by empowering their seller users to create attractive content / ad posts.\n    This could explain why successful C2C companies like [EBay](ebay.com) and [Ricardo](https://www.similarweb.com/website/ricardo.ch) allow users to customize their ads with styles / HTML, while others like [Vestiaire Collective](https://www.similarweb.com/website/vestiairecollective.com) and [Vide Dressing](https://www.similarweb.com/website/videdressing.com) tackle this problem by turning their users' product pictures into professional looking images. (\\*Example companies successful in Europe)\n\n\n\n**Social**\n\n- In the shoes of a seller, we can hypothesize that having followers DO really help a seller get sell more, as discussed above. **Hence, for an individual uploading products on a C2C website, it would not be enough to simply add products online.**\n  To maximize profit, a seller would also need to be proactive in getting followers, or in other words, advertise himself/herself.\n  \n  This is the approach taken by C2C businesses like [Vinted](https://www.similarweb.com/website/vinted.com), whose business model is solely based on having sellers promote their products through *ad boosting* and they seem successful. The fact that *Vinted* does not charge *listing fees* nor *commission upon sale* is a good plus in their advantage since most of their competitors do charge commissions based on the article price.\n  \n  It seems that the idea that one has to advertise oneself in order to get more sales is deeply ingraved in people's minds. So much so that many sellers are willing to pay to increase their visibility. It seems to be the only / main revenue income for [*Vinted*](https://www.vinted.com/how_it_works) and it seems they are doing well.\n  \n  This is especially true nowadays, since there are too many offers online. Sellers seem to think there are two ways to alleviate this issue: producing more quality content (better ad pictures, product descriptions, adequate categories, ...) or paying money to boost their products in the site's catalog.\n  It would be interesting to see where the market is leaning towards and which business model generates more revenue.\n  \n  Note that, the path *EBay* chose is to combine both approaches to maximize their revenue: they allow sellers to customize their ads (EBay charges some ad features like adding a subtitle) and they also allow sellers to boost the position of their ads in the listing. That gives EBay the benefit of both sources of revenues, which may explain why the company got more funds to develop itself.\n  It would be very instructive to have such companies share the results of both approaches, so that we might know what drives more revenue.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are other interesting things we might note, like the fact that `socialNbFollows` (the nbr of accounts a user follows) and `productsBought` are not correlated at all, but it would be wiser to look at this correlation using only the segment of data containing *buyers*. Sellers may have a different behaviour, such as using the \"follow\" feature to get some follow-back instead of showing their appreciation of the other user's content.\n\nSo how about the correlation matrix for buyers ?\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plotCorrelationMatrix(buyers_df.drop(all_unused_columns, axis=1, errors=\"ignore\"), 8, \"Buyers\")\n\nprint(f\"\"\"In average, buyers buy {buyers_df.productsBought.sum() / buyers_df.shape[0] :.2f} products.

This could be to keep up with the trends, or just to get inspiration of styles from influencers and other people in the social network.\n\n    Regardless, considering only the ROI in developping a social network feature for your website, it might seem that giving your users the ability to follow inspiring users would not directly lead to an increase in the overall number of sales on your website.\n    Thus in order to use the business' funds to optimize the ROI, there might be better ways than implementing that aspect.\n    \n    However, as the previous result shows, from the point of view of individual sellers, sellers compete with each other to gain more followers, and the sellers who get the most followers are more likely to grab the buyers' attention when those are looking for something new to buy.\n    \n    So a feature to \"follow\" accounts may not yield buyers to buy more from a C2C website as a whole, but rather this would help motivate the sellers of the platform, since they will be able to see positive results from taking the time to improve their presence on the platform. Sellers are aslo the oil of a C2C business, so pampering them may be one of the factors that set apart successful C2C businesses.\n    \n  \n  - **_However_**, this weak correlation could be mitigated if we consider that maybe users with lower budgets might tend to \"dream\" more and follow more accounts, even though they cannot afford to buy from that much of their influencers.\n   \n    After all, clients cannot simply buy a product from each seller they follow. No one has an infinite amount of money to spend, not mentionning that some clients and prospects may even be on budget. In general, buyers bought `3` products in `average`, while the `median` stands at `1`.\n\n\nIn order to conclude whether or not a social network feature is worth it or not in terms of ROI, it would be necessary to look at other data and taking into account parameters specific to your business.\n\nFor instance, the prices of the products. If most products on a website are \"cheap\" (cheap compared to the standard budget people would allocate for your type of products) and there is a very weak correlation between `the number of accounts users follow` and the `number of products bought`, then it would lean towards the first hypothesis, since we could reasonably assume users have enough money to buy more products.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that it would be necessary to normalize the relationship between those two columns using other sources of data. The idea is that, for example, maybe the correlation is roughly linear, but the coefficient of linearity is so low that it would appear as if the correlation is weak or non existent.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### User retention\n\nFinally, a little parting gift: a graph showing user retention over time.\n\nA lot of users drop out quickly.

And if your sellers sell more, your business can earn more too.\n\n- Adding a social network feature on a platform that connects sellers with buyers can greatly help your best sellers stand out. Seeing their efforts pay off will serve as rewards pushing them to invest more time and effort to build their community on *your* platform, which is for your benefit. After all, having sellers compete with one another yields to better products/contents/services for your customers and thus your reputation.\n  \n  And you should not forget that sellers are the oil that allow a C2C (or B2C) business to move forward.
