The last column is the class (binary, IGNORE=0, BUY=1).\n    2. `Example_2019_prive_var.cs`  contains a table where each row is an US stock from the technology sector and the column indicates the stock's percent price variation for the year 2019 (first trading day on Jan '19, last trading day on Dec '19).\n\n  I will later share a kernel where I will show how you can build these types of datasets.\n\n  From a general point of view, I will be considering the financial data collected in the `Example_DATASET.csv` as features. The data collected there are from the 10-K filings of 2018 (end of 2018). The class of each sample has been assigned by looking at the performance of the stock in the year 2019 (`Example_2019_price_var.csv`), that is:\n    1. Class = 1 if 2019 price variation is positive;\n    2. Class = 0 if 2019 price variation is negative.\n    \n  **So, this is a binary classification problem and the objective is to BUY all the stocks that will be classified as `1`, and to IGNORE all those stocks that will be classified as `0`.**\n\n* **ABOUT THE MODELS**\n\n    The machine learning models that I will be using are:\n    1. Support Vector Machine (`SVC`, scikit-learn);\n    2. Random Forest (`RandomForestClassifier`, scikit-learn);\n    3. Extreme Gradient Boosting (`xgb`, xgboost);\n    4. Multi-Layer Perceptron (`MLPClassifier`, scikit-learn).\n\n  Nothing too fancy, I am more interested in the proof-of-concept right now (if the results are satisfactory, I will implement more sofisticated neural networks via Keras or Pytorch). For what concerns the training of the models, I will be running a `GridSearchCV` with `cv=5` and `scoring='precision_weighted'`.\n    \n* **ABOUT THE LAZY WAY**\n\n    Compared to other algorithmic trading strategies, this kernel implements a **lazy strategy** which consists in buying the stocks that the machine learning models identify as buy-worthy on the first trading day of the year and selling them on the last trading day of the year. Indeed, it is widely known that most of the times buying-&-holding a stock yields higher returns compared to trying to time the market.\n    \n    As of now, this method has only been backtested with the year 2019, but I am planning to perform more backtesting with older data.\n    \n    \n* **ABOUT THE MODEL'S EVALUATION**\n\n    The evaluation of the machine learning models' performance is a two-step process:\n    \n    1. An analysis of the `classification_report` is performed in order to evaluate the models according to commonly used metrics\n    2. An analysis of the machine learning models' Return On Investment (ROI) is performed in order to evaluate their performance from a financial point of view. Furthermore, the ROI of S&P 500 index (^GSPC), Dow Jones index (^DJI) and the ROI of the Technology sector are used as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the **lazy strategy**.\n   "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's start by importing the required libraries.
