Although not all teams that attract people have a high valuation, for the team to be valuable, it needs to have a high audience.\n\n### Audience, the audience, for its part, does not depend on the performance of the team. There are very good teams that bring the same or fewer people to their stadium than there are teams that play badly.\n\n### What can be seen is that the audience is something that depends on the city. and among the variables of the cities, which affect the atendence, are tourism and the number of people who live in the state, they affect this variable. As you can see in this link (https://www.infoplease.com/us/states/state-population-by-rank), the four largest states coincide with the location of the most valuable teams: New york, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Texas. The only exception to this rule is the Boston Celtics, who don't have a large crowd but are in the top 10 of the most valuable teams.\n\n### Attendance, which is derived from the location, is the most important variable when evaluating a basketball team.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
