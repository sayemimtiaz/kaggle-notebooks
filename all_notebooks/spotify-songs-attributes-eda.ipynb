We will focus on the dataset 1950.csv, which contains:\n\n* all the songs from the Spotify's playlist \"All out 50s\" that you can find [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWSV3Tk4GO2fq). This playlist collects the most popular and iconic songs from a given decade, in this case it collects the most popular songs from the 50s (1950-1959).\n* for each listed song, a series of attributes are collected in every column of the dataset, as explained in the description of the dataset.\n\nThe objective is to better understand the data, and study some relationships between the various attributes."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1: LOAD PACKAGES AND DATA\n\nLet's begin by importing the required packages and data.

This is one of the most commonly used tools to quickly understand how and how much the variables' behavior are related to each other. Furthermore, it allows us to better understand the observations/hypotheses we did when looking at the `pairplot`. \n\nThe correlation matrix shown below confirms what we already noticed previoulsy: most of the variables are positively related, meaning that they show a similar trend/behavior. The only variables showing a different behavior are `dur` and `acous`. Looking at the correlation matrix, one could infer that:\n* the longer the song, the less is has energy, danceability, loudness, liveness. This is understandable in terms of enery and danceability, less so in terms of loudness.\n* the longer the song, the more it is popular.
