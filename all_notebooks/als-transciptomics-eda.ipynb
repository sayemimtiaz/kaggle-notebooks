PRELIMINARY DRAFT TO BE MODIFIED \n\n\n\nNotebook for https://www.kaggle.com/alsgroup/end-als\n\nWe consider transcriptomics data and make some EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis).\nTranscriptomics - measures genes expressions for cells. There are 53859 genes.\n\n\nSome findings: \n\n1) We see data are non-negative - that means probably they obtained - log(1+counts)+normalization(?) - typical processing.\n\n2) 173 genes have zero expression - we can throw them out\n\n3) Top expressed genes contain MALAT1 , MT.*** (Mitochondrial genes ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA )) \nthat seems to happen for many transcriptomics datasets, so it  seems  not worth for analysis.\n\n(See for example https://www.kaggle.com/alexandervc/sciplex2-part-1-eda?scriptVersionId=57667001 cell 22 - MALAT1 abd MT.RNR2 - on top , or https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html cell 8 - MALAT1 - on top )\n\n4) Gene NEFL - \"is a useful marker for disease monitoring in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,[9]\" (among top expressed - does it mean something ?)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofilament_light_polypeptide\n\nIt is one the top expressed genes - and related to neuro diseases.\n\n Roc auc on three datasets: \n bulbar_vs_limb \tmedian_low_vs_high  ctrl_vs_case \nNEFL\t0.392\t0.397\t0.489\n\n\n5) List of selected genes and their roc auc\n\nThese genes taken from wikipedia and etc.:\n\nlist_genes = ['NEFL', 'C9orf72', 'SOD1',  'TARDBP','FUS', 'NEFH',\n              'MATR3', 'TUBA4A' ,\n'ANXA11', 'NEK1',  'TBK1', 'CCNF', 'TIA1',\n             'ALS2']\n             \nWe check their roc_auc. Beware that std for completely random predictor is about 0.05, so no gene goes beyond 3 std, and thus by its own can be considered reliably good predictor, however - may be good prediction on all three targets simultaneously would mean something - I will check later.\n\n\n6) Correlation analysis. We see that FUS is strongly anticorrelated with many genes.\nGenes: ['C9orf72','MATR3','TUBA4A','NEFL'] correlated with each other about 0.3-0.5 and anticorrelated with FUS about 0.5-0.6.\nSuch correletions seems to cannot be random. \n\n\n7) Added info on genes from mygene package. Surprised that cell cycle genes CCNF, NEK1 are also related to ALS.\nNEK1 - Associated with 3-5% of ALS cases; **considered an ALS risk gene rather than a causative gene** as of 2018.[1]\n( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_of_amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis  )\n\nANXA11 is quite correlated with CCNF. While ANXA11 - 'Definite ALS' (and also schizophrenia ) \n\n\n8) Dimensional reduction by PCA, UMAP does not reveal clear clusters in data, neither separation by targers is not seen. \n\n9) Added: analysis of strictly bigger genes list ( 154  ALS related genes) from https://alsod.ac.uk/ \n\n9.1) We see correlation are much higher than for random data or even for random subset of genes from our dataset.\nThat suggests that this subset is not kind of random.\n\n9.2) Top genes by predictive power - OPTN HNRNPA2B1 have RocAuc on second task about 65 which is of order 3* std of random,\nwhich is not bad evidence that it makes sense. (OPTN is marked as \"Definitive ALS gene\" on site above, while HNRNPA2B1 as \"Tenuous\".\n\n9.3) Moreover these genes are highly (anti)-correlated with other known ALS genes: FUS, NEFL and with each other - yet another evidence.\n\n9.4) Top 3 - NIPA1  - marked \"Strong evidence\" - strongly (anti)-correlated with NEFL,OPTN - which are known to be related to ALS, also 0.37 correlated with SOD1 - definitive ALS, and 0.68 with SOD2 - tenous , while SOD1,SOD2 are correlated and by definition related.\nNIPA1 - is the best predict for bulbar_vs_limb.\n\n9.5) ANXA11 - 'Definite ALS' (and also schizophrenia ) - is highly correlated with many other relevant genes  like NEFL,KIF5A.\nIt seems kind of heart of the high correlation cluster. \n\n\n\nPSPS\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis_research\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_of_amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis\n\n\n\n-------------------\n\nVersion 10: mild updates - from 154 genes some are not or very poorly expressed in current data - probably should be excluded.\n\nVersion 9: Added: analysis of strictly bigger genes list ( 154  ALS related genes) from https://alsod.ac.uk/ \n\nVersion 8: Added: Dimensional reductions PCA, UMAP and visualization\n\nVersion 7: Added: information on genes with mygene package \n\nVersion 6:  Added: Selected genes correlation analysis\n\nVersion 5: Added: selected genes list and checked their roc_auc\n\n\nNot mentioned version -

It was the first time that linkage analysis was successful in identifying the genetic cause of a rare neurodegenerative disorder.[6] SOD1 is one of the most common genes associated with ALS, accounting for about 12% of fALS and 1-2% of sALS. The second gene, NEFH, was identified in 1994, followed by SETX in 1998, ALS2 in 2001, DCTN1 in 2003, and CHMP2B in 2006. All of these genes are fairly rare; the next major ALS gene, TARDBP, was identified in 2008 and accounts for 4% of fALS and 1% of sALS. FUS was identified in 2009 and is seen in 4% of fALS and 1% of sALS. VCP was identified in 2010 and accounts for 1% of fALS and 1% of sALS; ATXN2, OPTN, and UBQLN2 were associated with ALS that same year.[2]\n\nAnother major milestone was the discovery of C9orf72 in 2011, which is the most common gene associated with ALS, accounting for about 40% of fALS cases and 7% of sALS cases. C9orf72 was also found to contribute significantly to frontotemporal dementia (FTD). SQSTM1 was also identified in 2011, but accounts for 1% of fALS and less than 1% of sALS. PFN1 was identified in 2012, HNRNPA1 and HNRNPA2B1 in 2013, CHCHD10, MATR3, and TUBA4A in 2014, and TBK1 in 2015. C21orf2, CCNF, and NEK1 were associated with ALS in 2016.[2]\n\nThe first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ALS was published in 2007, and 14 GWASs total had been published through 2013. They have contributed significantly to our understanding of ALS genetics; for example, a 2010 GWAS studying ALS in Finland led to discovery of the role of mutations at the C9orf72 locus in ALS. However, a gene identified by a single GWAS may not actually be associated with ALS, especially if the cohort size is small. In outbred populations, thousands of cases (people with ALS) and controls (people without ALS) are required for a GWAS to have sufficient statistical power to confidently identify a gene's association with ALS.[6]"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"list_genes = ['NEFL', 'C9orf72', 'SOD1',  'TARDBP','FUS', 'NEFH',\n              'MATR3', 'TUBA4A' ,\n'ANXA11', 'NEK1',  'TBK1', 'CCNF', 'TIA1',\n             'ALS2']\n\n# 'C21orf2', -
