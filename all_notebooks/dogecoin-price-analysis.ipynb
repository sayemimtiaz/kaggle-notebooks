Some useful data would be:\n\n* The price trend of Bitcoin, to compare the most popular cryptocurrency with Dogecoin. Is Dogecoin an inferior good, that only those who can't afford to buy into Bitcoin opt for, or has the boom in price of Bitcoin led speculators to assume Dogecoin will grow in a similar way?\n\n* The price trend of the Stock Market, which is the most widely invested in and accepted investment tool in the US. Especially if ROI rates could be considered between crypto-investments and Wall Street Investments, and compared with some of the other events happening around that time (Gamestop, anyone??)\n\n* The yield of the 10 Year T Note. This is a staple of ensured investment and, honestly, if the US Gov't defaults on a bond, there's a good chance losing a few thousand dollars is going to be the least of your worries, assuming you are from the US. With rates finally climbing up following this trend, and the supply of cheap loans starting to contract, this may have led to a decline in Dogecoin attractiveness. It has been argued, however, that cheap money makes for risky investments, since stable investments aren't paying much at all. \n\n* How has Dogecoin faired since NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have risen in popularity?

The value that it held in early 2021 has begun to come down; there could be an additional peak or growth in the future, as there have been in the past (but, if it was truly predictable, I would probably be investing at the lows, waiting to sell off at the next peak, and not giving out any analysis freely, at the least).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## THANK YOU!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I hope this notebook has been enjoyable, and either given you context, info, or a chuckle about, arguably, the cutest of cryptocurrencies.
