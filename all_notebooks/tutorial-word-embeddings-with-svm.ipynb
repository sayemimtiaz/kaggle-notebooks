In this kernel I'm going to show you how to use word embeddings with traditional machine learning models like Support Vector Machine. We'll use word2vec to train word vectors, scikit-learn to train SVM.\n\nBefore starting let's take a look at some topics\n\n### Why Word Vectors/Embeddings\nIn natural language processing, we have to make words understandable for computer. There are several ways to do this and in order to understand why word embeddings, let's examine a more primitive way, one hot encoding.\n\nIn one hot encoding technique, we have to create a one hot vector (a vector which has only one 1 value, also others have to be 0) which has a length number of the words we have in our vocab.\n\nSuch as let's make an example. We have a vocab like this => {\"My\",\"Mine\",\"Turkey\",\"Nice\"} So our each vector for a word will 4D.\n\nLet's check the vectors of the words:\nMy => [1,0,0,0]\nMine => [0,1,0,0]\nTurkey => [0,0,1,0]\nNice => [0,0,0,1]\n\nBut if we compute the distance between my&mine and Turkey&mine we can see the distances are same and this means **we could not protect the real relationships between the words**\n\nSo let's briefly explain the disadvantages of one hot encoding\n\n**Disadvantages of One Hot Encoding**:\n* In big vocabs vectors for the words are insanely big and this causes memory problems\n* Most of the elements of the vector don't have a meaning.\n* It's impossible to protect the relation between the words because each vector's distance is same.\n\nSo we need a better way to do this and we have this: **word embeddings!**\n\n### Word Embeddings\nBefore implementing it with a Support Vector Machine let's understand what are they. In word embeddings each element of vector is a different number. I said in **one hot encoding** most of the elements of vector don't have a meaning but word in word embeddings they have a meaning.\n\nLet's make an example.\n\nWe have a vocab like = {\"My,\"Mine\",\"Your\",\"Turkey\"}\n\nTheir vectors might like this:\n\nMy = [1.12,1.42.1,45.1,52]\nMine = [1.14,1.40,1.47,1.53]\nTurkey = [3.132,4.12312,6,123,7.123]\n\n\nAs you see if we compute the distance between *my* and *mine* it's closer than *mine* and *turkey*.\n\nI can hear your questions: \"Of course, but how can we create this vectors?\".\nWe'll create this vectors by computing the probabilities of being words side by side.\n\nThis information is enough, let's start.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preparing Environment","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport gensim\nimport nltk\nimport re\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/spam-text-message-classification/SPAM text message 20170820 - Data.csv')\ndata.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Preprocessing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We'll write a function which will clean the text and prepare it.\ndef cleanText(text):\n    cleaned = re.sub(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9']\",\" \",text)\n    lowered = cleaned.lower()\n    return lowered.strip()\n\ncleanText(\"Let's test our function, by writing this string!\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x,y = np.asarray(data[\"Message\"]),np.asarray(data[\"Category\"])\n\nx_cleaned = [cleanText(t) for t in x]\nx_cleaned[:4]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Also we should convert our categories to the integer labels\nlabel_map = {cat:index for index,cat in enumerate(np.unique(y))}\ny_prep = np.asarray([label_map[l] for l in y])\n\nlabel_map","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Training Word Embeddings\nUntil here I did not explain code so much with markdowns but the thing starts here so let's explain what will we do in this section.\n\nIn this section we're going to train word embeddings using our data and in order to train those word vectors we'll tokenize our data.\n\nTokenizing basically means splitting sentences into words (e.g. You are nice => [\"You\",\"are\",\"nice\"])\nThen we'll train our model using gensim.
