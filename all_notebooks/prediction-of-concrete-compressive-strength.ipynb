Yeh, Chung-Hua University via UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository  \n**Citation:** I-Cheng Yeh, \"Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using artificial neural networks,\" Cement and Concrete Research, Vol. 28, No. 12, pp. 1797-1808 (1998). \n  \n**Motivation:** I have spent the previous four months learning to program with Python and applying it to machine learning applications. In deciding on an initial independent data science project, I searched for a dataset that was relatively easy to work with, of interest to me, and suitable for regression analysis. I selected this dataset because: it is fairly easy to work with, it is suitable for regression analysis, and, as a structural geologist, the compressive strength of materials (usually rocks, but concrete is neat too) is of interest to me.  \n  \n**Abstract:** Concrete has widespread use as a building material and is a primary constituent of many infrastructure and construction projects. Traditional concrete has three ingredients: Portland cement, aggreagates, and water. High-performance concrete (HPC), the focus of this dataset, uses additional material that have a cementitious properties (Yeh, 1998). The addition of these material makes for a complex material, of which the compressive strength is difficult to predict. Given this problem, I.-C. Yeh, the original owner of this dataset, set out to predict the strength of HPC using neural networks. His work produced a model of compressive strength with an R2 of ~0.9 +/- ~0.05. This measure of accuracy can be used as a benchmark against the models produced in this analysis.  \n  \n**Objective:** The main objective of this project is to understand variability in the prediction of different regression models. I will accomplish this in three steps: 1) predict compressive strength with various regression models, 2) compare the models using visualizations and measures of accuracy, and 3) analyze the importance of features in each model.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **DATA EXPLORATION AND VISUALIZATION**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Within this section, basics data exploration steps are carried out to understand the data, make it easier to work with as a DataFrame, and make initial observations about the distributions of the data and the correlation between each feature and the compressive strength, the target for prediction.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This code cell reads the concrete compressive strenght .csv into a Pandas data frame.\nconcrete = pd.read_csv('../input/concrete-compressive-strength-uci/Concrete_Data.csv')\nconcrete.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# As seen above, the column names in this dataset are quite long. \n# The code below will rename the columns so they are easier to work with.\ncolumns = ['cement', 'slag', 'flyash', 'water', 'superplasticizer', 'coarseagg', 'fineagg', 'age', 'strength']\nconcrete.columns = columns\nconcrete.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check column data types.\nconcrete.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check for missing values in the dataset.\nconcrete.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# There is no missing data.

This finding is consistent with the work of Yeh (1998). The Decision Tree and Random Forest regression models used here were able to predict the compressive strength of HPC with accuracy in line with the work of Yeh (1998). \n  \n**Objectives:** I was able to successfully accomplish my objectives for this project, my first independent machine learning project. The use of different regression models, along with visualizing and comparing measures of accuracy, allowed me to understand why certain models are used more frequently. While completing Kaggle's Microcourses, I was curious why the machine learning courses began with Decision Tree and Random Forest regression models without any discussion of a basic Linear model, however, this analysis helps demonstrate why (they are significantly more accurate). The feature importance analysis conducted also helped to illustrate what features had the largest impact of the models and led to a potential next step for this project. \n  \n**Learnings and Next Steps:** Not suprisingly, the ensemble model (Random Forest) performed better than the more simple Linear, Ridge, and Decision Tree models, which reinforces the benefit of ensemble methods. Potential next steps to improve the prediction of compressive strength of HPC are: 1) select features for model building based on cutoff values from feature importance values, 2) select additional ensemble methods for model building, and 3) all models used here are first pass models, future models could alter the characteristics (i.e. setting value for max_leaf_nodes) to improve accuracy.
