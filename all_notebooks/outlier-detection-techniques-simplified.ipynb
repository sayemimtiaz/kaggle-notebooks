Z-score is finding the distribution of data where mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1 i.e. normal distribution.\n\n#### You must be wondering that, how does this help in identifying the outliers? Well, while calculating the Z-score we re-scale and center the data and look for data points which are too far from zero. These data points which are way too far from zero will be treated as the outliers. In most of the cases a threshold of 3 or -3 is used i.e if the Z-score value is greater than or less than 3 or -3 respectively, that data point will be identified as outliers.\n\n#### This technique assumes a Gaussian distribution of the data. The outliers are the data points that are in the tails of the distribution and therefore far from the mean. How far depends on a set threshold zthr for the normalized data points zi calculated with the formula: \n\n###                      Z_score= (Xi - mean) / standard deviation \n\n#### where Xi is a data point, 'mean' is the mean of all X and 'standard deviation' the standard deviation of all X.\n\n#### An outlier is then a normalized data point which has an absolute value greater than Zthr. That is:\n\n###                                     |Z_score| > Zthr\n\n#### Commonly used Zthr values are 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5.

The isolation number is the number of splits needed to isolate a data point. This number of splits is ascertained by following these steps:\n\n#### - A point “a” to isolate is selected randomly.\n#### - A random data point “b” is selected that is between the minimum and maximum value and different from “a”.\n#### - If the value of “b” is lower than the value of “a”, the value of “b” becomes the new lower limit.\n#### - If the value of “b” is greater than the value of “a”, the value of “b” becomes the new upper limit.\n#### - This procedure is repeated as long as there are data points other than “a” between the upper and the lower limit. \n\n#### It requires fewer splits to isolate an outlier than it does to isolate a non-outlier, i.e. an outlier has a lower isolation number in comparison to a non-outlier point.
