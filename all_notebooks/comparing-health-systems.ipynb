Does spending more always lead to better results, or does it matter who spends the money and where it goes? This is the basic question in this notebook. That means the roadmap will be as follows: \n\nFirst I'll explore the world bank data to see which countries spend the highest amounts of their money on their healthcare. Ofcourse there is more than one way to spend money on healthcare. Governments often spend most of the money, but people also spend out of pocket money. And ofcourse there is, in some countries, an influx of foreign aid also adds to the amount of money spend.\n\nWhen that is done I'll start to look at how all this increases or decreases the effectiveness of the overall health system. There is an obvious problem of corrolation vs causation here. The richer countries are more likely to be able to spend more money, but they are also the key beneficiaries of new technologies and often have healthier environments. This means that even if we'd find an effect of health spending on healthiness, it may be an effect of wealth, the environment or technology. So, we should be carefull with the claims we make and take into consideration many more factors than just healthcare spending and effectiveness.\n\nThe thirds step is to look at how general effectiveness translates into the ability of a country to keep epidemics of communicable diseases under control. Ofcourse these analyses have the same caveats as the earlier steps. This will lead towards the last part, where I'll take a look at Covid-19 and how succesfull the responses have been.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n1.

The full dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/danevans/world-bank-wdi-212-health-systems). The figures below show the ten biggest and lowest spenders. These figures include government spending, out of pocket spending and foreign aid. It is immediately visible that looking at total spending won't be enough, as there are many different things going on. Broadly speaking we can discern two groups. First there are the smaller nations, which have a very small GDP. The Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Tuvalu, Sierra Leone, Kiribati & Palau can all be found at or near the bottom of [list](https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/) of GDP numbers. This means that relatively small increases of spending in absolute terms would lead to big rises in the relative terms shown in the graph.\n\nThe United States, Brazil & Switzerland clearly belong to a second group of countries with a big GDP. They spend, both in absolute and in relative terms, a lot of money on their healthcare. It may be interesting to note in the current crises that both the United States and Brazil spend so much on healthcare. Both countries have been hit hard by Covid-19 and have struggled to find an appropriate response.\n\nCuba stands more or less alone, for political and socio-economic reasons. It does not have a large GDP, but it is well known for it's healthcare system. The government spends a lot on healthcare and it would be interesting to look how effective the system is in the next parts.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"healthsysdf = pd.read_csv('../input/world-bank-wdi-212-health-systems/2.12_Health_systems.csv') #load first dataset\n\nhealthsysdf = healthsysdf.drop(columns = 'Province_State') #drop useless columns\nhealthsysdf = healthsysdf.drop(columns = 'Country_Region')\nhealthsysdf['Total_Gov_Spend'] = healthsysdf.apply(lambda row: (row.Health_exp_pct_GDP_2016 / 100) * row.Health_exp_public_pct_2016, axis = 1) #calculate total government spending\nhealthsysdf['Outofpocket_Spend'] = healthsysdf.apply(lambda row: (row.Health_exp_pct_GDP_2016 / 100) * row.Health_exp_out_of_pocket_pct_2016, axis = 1) #calculate total out of pocket spending\nhealthsysdf['Other_Spend'] = healthsysdf.apply(lambda row: row.Health_exp_pct_GDP_2016 -

Another way of paying is by being insured or by paying for healthcare directly out of pocket.\n\nIn the world bank data that we are currently looking at insurance and state spending both fall under the government spending category. This may be misleading since people still need to pay for insurance. The same can be said about government. You pay for it through taxes.
