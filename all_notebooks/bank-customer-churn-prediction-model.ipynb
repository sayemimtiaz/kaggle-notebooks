Customer churn is one of the biggest concerns of a bank and through a combination of exploratory data analysis and model predictions the bank intends to retain its customers and minimize customer loss.\nChurn is defined as a movement of a customer/client from one company to the other. There are several reasons that may lead to an increase in customer churn in the case of banks. Some of the reasons are stated below: \na) Availability of latest technology   b)Customer friendly staff c) Low interest rates\nOn average, service providers such as banks experience a churn rate between 10 to 30 % \nAfter running prections using machine learning models, the bank wants to know those potential customers who are at risk of leaving the bank so that the bank can direct their efforts towards retaining them through promotions, offers et cetera.\n\n\n#CUSTOMER CHURN MODELS\nSuch models are developed to identify those customers who are likely to churn. These models uses historical data on former churners in order to find similarities with existing clients. Customers who are found to exhibit such similarities are classified as potential churners.\nBanks choose to focus more on retaining customers because the cost of attracting new customers is much more than the cost incurred on retaining them. Customers who are associated with the bank on a long-term basis less costly to serve and therefore generate higher profit for the bank. Such customers also provide new referrals which negates the needs for banks to direct a chunk of their resources towards attracting new customers.\n\nIn this project, the following sequence of actions will be undertaken:\na) An exploratory data analysis of the database will be undertaken to summarize the data and interpretations will be stated as per requirement for better understanding.\nb) For predicting possible customer attrition/churn in the future, different models will be used to find the most accurate results which will be used to help the bank to reduce customer churn.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Load the dataset from Computer durectory\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/bank-customer-churn-prediction-model-analysis/Churn_Modelling1.csv')\n\n#Displaying the top 5 rows of the dataset\ndf1.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**DATASET PREPROCESSING**\nWe are going to use a dataset which gives information regarding bank customers and their associated features for predicting whether a customer is likely to leave the bank or not","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will import pre-installed libraries for the purpose of exploratory data analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import figure, show,suptitle\nfrom scipy import stats","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**We now check for missing values in the dataset**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df1.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**There are no missing values in any of the columns and we can proceed further \nCheck the data type for each column/variable in the dataset**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df1.dtypes","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1) **CustomerID**: Unique number assigned to each bank customer**\n\n2) **Surname**: Last name of each bank customer\n\n3) **CreditScore**: It is a number that shows the customer's creditworthiness.
