It is designed to be compatible with many existing CPU tools, such as Pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc. It enables **massive** acceleration of many data-science and machine learning tasks, oftentimes by a factor fo 100X, or even more. \n\nRapids is still undergoing developemnt, and as of right now it's not availabel in the Kaggle Docker environment. If you are interested in installing and riunning Rapids locally on your own machine, then you should [refer to the followong instructions](https://rapids.ai/start.html).\n\nIn order to install Rapids locally we'll be follow the setup that was inmplemented by Chris Deotte in [the following kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/rapids-data-augmentation-mnist-0-985)."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n# INSTALL RAPIDS OFFLINE (FROM KAGGLE DATASET).

The resulting dataset will be viewed on scatterplot in 2D. It turns out to be overall rather featureless, but that's **exactly** what we would expect from the way that personality is understood - no clear clusters, and use of typology for personality is unwarranted. Nonetheless, we'll take a look at how geneder is distributed in the big persoanlity cluster. It turns out that a simple [logistic regression trained on the original item features can achieve AUC of 0.87.](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/16p-gender-with-logistic-regression). A simple look at the gender distribution on the tSNE plot will reveal *some* overall features, but nothing that jumps conclusively out.
