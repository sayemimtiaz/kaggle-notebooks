This dataset was part of the Ph.D. Thesis of Dr. Hamdi Tolga Kahraman from Turkey back in 2009. It is an unlabelled dataset containing 5 features as explained in the column descriptions. The data contains real information about the student's knowledge status about the subject of Electrical DC Machines. The insipiration is to find clusters within data, explore their properties and make meaningful conclusions and actions / recommendations that might add value to the process from where the data was obtained.\n\n### K-Means Clustering\nClustering is process of grouping of objects into groups that have same or similar properties. K-means is an algorithm in unsupervised learning that tries to partition or group data into K groups, where 1 k point is only owned by 1 group and the characteristics of the data in one group have a high similarity while the characteristics of data between gorups are different. In k means we will know several terms, i.e.:\n- Cluster Centroids: The cluster centroid is the most representative point of a specific cluster. So, if we decide to find three clusters, we will have three cluster centroid.\n- Euclidean Distance: Is the distance between two data points and this term is essential when gathering the distance between the cluster centroids and the data points.\n- Elbow Method: The elbow method is a technique used to choose the most optimal number of clusters. Remember, in Kmeans clustering we add the number of clusters in a manual way, so the elbow method is useful when using Kmeans. \n\n**Criteria to produce good cluster**\n- The similarity between members in a cluster (intracluster) is high\n- Similarities between members of different clusters (inter-cluster) is low\n\n**The way kmeans algorithm works**\n- Specify number of clusters K.\n- Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.\n    - Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.\n    - Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).\n    - Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data points that belong to each cluster.\n- Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isn’t changing.\n\n## Packages\nThe main module in python used for clustering is `scikit-learn`.
