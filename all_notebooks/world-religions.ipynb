It is the world's second-largest religion with over 1.8 billion followers or 24% of the world's population, commonly known as Muslims. Muslims make up a majority of the population in 50 countries. Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful, and unique, and has guided mankind through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs. The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran, claimed to be the verbatim word of God, and the teachings and normative examples (called the sunnah, composed of accounts called hadith) of Muhammad (c. 570 – 8 June 632 CE).\n\nIslamic scripture claims Islam to be the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, and the Quran in its Arabic to be the unaltered and final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous punished in hell. Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following Islamic law (sharia), which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment. The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\n\n![](https://aday.zeplinsoft.com/images/haber/islam-ile-yuzlesmek-AnaResim-30042019-115903-02976100.jpg)","attachments":{}},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n                x=global_.year,\n                y=global_.islam_sunni,\n                name=\"Sunni\",\n                line = dict(color='royalblue', width=4, dash='dash'),\n                opacity=0.8))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n                x=global_.year,\n                y=global_[\"islam_shi’a\"] ,\n                name=\"Shi\",\n               line = dict(color='dimgray', width=4, dash='dot'),\n                opacity=0.8))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n                x=global_.year,\n                y=global_[\"islam_ibadhi\"] ,\n                name=\"Ibadhi\",\n               line = dict(color='orange', width=4, dash='dot'),\n                opacity=0.8))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n                x=global_.year,\n                y=global_[\"islam_alawite\" ] ,\n                name=\"Alawite\",\n                line = dict(color='red', width=4, dash='dash'),\n                opacity=0.8))\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n                x=global_.year,\n                y=global_[\"islam_ahmadiyya\" ] ,\n                name=\"Ahmadiyya\",\n                line = dict(color='purple', width=4, dash='dot'),\n                opacity=0.8))\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n                x=global_.year,\n                y=global_[\"islam_other\" ] ,\n                name=\"Other\",\n                line = dict(color='black', width=4, dash='dot'),\n                opacity=0.8))\nfig.update_layout(title_text=\"NUMBER OF MUSLIMS BY YEAR\",   paper_bgcolor='lavenderblush',font=dict(family=\"sans\", size=15,color=\"black\"),\n              plot_bgcolor='ivory', xaxis= dict(title= 'Year'),yaxis= dict(title= 'Number'))\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a> <br>\n**SUNNI ISLAM**\n\nSunni Islam, also known as Ahl as-Sunnah wa'l-Jamā'h or simply Ahl as-Sunnah, is the largest denomination of Islam.

Its adherents, known as Christians, believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and the savior of all people, whose coming as the Messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures of Judaism, called the Old Testament in Christianity, and chronicled in the New Testament. It is the world's largest religion with over 2.4 billion followers.\n\nChristianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the 1st century in the Roman province of Judea. Jesus' apostles and their followers spread around Syria, Levant, Europe, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Transcaucasia, Egypt, and Ethiopia, despite initial persecution. It soon attracted gentile God-fearers, which led to a departure from Jewish customs, and, after the Fall of Jerusalem, AD 70 which ended the Temple-based Judaism, Christianity as a religion began.\n\nEmperor Constantine the Great converted to Christianity (312) and decriminalized it in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan (313), later convening the Council of Nicaea (325) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the state church of the Roman Empire (380). The early history of Christianity's united communion before major schisms is sometimes referred to as the \"Great Church\". Oriental Orthodoxy and the Church of the East split after the Council of Chalcedon (451) over differences in Christology,[4] while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East–West Schism (1054), especially over the authority of the bishop of Rome. Similarly, Protestantism split in numerous denominations from the Catholic Church in the Reformation (16th century) over theological and ecclesiological disputes, most predominantly on the issue of justification and the primacy of the bishop of Rome. Following the Age of Discovery (15th–17th century), Christianity was spread into the Americas, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and the rest of the world via missionary work.\n\nChristianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches, as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology. The four largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church (1.3 billion/50.1 %), Protestantism (920 million/36.7 %), the Eastern Orthodox Church (260 million) and Oriental Orthodoxy (86 million/both together 11.9 %), amid various efforts toward unity (ecumenism).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity\n\n![](https://www.premierchristianradio.com/var/ezdemo_site/storage/images/media/images/cross-1-main/40263782-1-eng-GB/cross-1-main_article_image.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"trace1 = go.Bar(\n                    x = global_.year,\n                    y = global_.christianity_protestant,\n                  \n                    name = \"Protestans\",\n                    marker = dict(color = 'indianred'))\n\ntrace2 = go.Bar(\n                    x = global_.year,\n                    y = global_.christianity_romancatholic,\n                    \n                    name = \"Roman Catholics\",\n                    marker = dict(color = 'lightsalmon'))\ntrace3 = go.Bar(\n                    x = global_.year,\n                    y = global_.christianity_easternorthodox,\n                    marker = dict(color = 'rgb(158,202,225)'),\n                    name = \"Eastern North Orthodoxes\")\ntrace5 = go.Bar(\n                    x = global_.year,\n                    y = global_.christianity_anglican,\n                    marker = dict(color = 'darkblue'),\n                    name = \"Anglicans\")\ntrace4 = go.Bar(\n                    x = global_.year,\n                    y = global_.christianity_other,\n                     marker = dict(color = 'royalblue'),\n                    name = \"Other Christians\"\n                    )                 \n\ndata = [trace1, trace2,trace3,trace4,trace5]\nlayout = dict(title = 'NUMBER OF CHRISTIANS BY YEARS', barmode='stack',\n              xaxis= dict(title= 'Years',ticklen= 5,zeroline= False,zerolinewidth=1,gridcolor=\"lightsteelblue\"),\n              yaxis= dict(title= 'Count',ticklen= 5,zeroline= False,zerolinewidth=1,gridcolor=\"lightsteelblue\",),\n              paper_bgcolor='whitesmoke',\n              plot_bgcolor='snow' ,\nfont=dict(family=\"DejaVu Sans\", size=15,color=\"black\"))\nfig = dict(data = data, layout = layout)\niplot(fig)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"6\"></a> <br>\n**ROMAN CATHOLICS (CATHOLIC CHURCH) **\n\nThe Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with approximately 1.3 billion baptised Catholics worldwide as of 2017.

It originated with the 16th century Reformation, a movement against what its followers perceived to be errors in the Roman Catholic Church. Protestants reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments, but disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. They emphasize the priesthood of all believers, justification by faith alone (sola fide) rather than also by good works, and the highest authority of the Bible alone (rather than also with sacred tradition) in faith and morals (sola scriptura). The \"five solae\" summarise basic theological differences in opposition to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nProtestantism is popularly considered to have begun in Germany  in 1517 when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses as a reaction against abuses in the sale of indulgences by the Roman Catholic Church, which purported to offer the remission of the temporal punishment of sins to their purchasers.  However, the term derives from the letter of protestation from German Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict of the Diet of Speyer condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.choropleth(national, locations=\"code\",\n                    color=\"christianity_protestant\",\n                    hover_name=\"state\", # column to add to hover information\n                    color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Reds,\n                     animation_frame=\"year\",animation_group=\"code\")\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text = 'PROTESTAN CHRISTIANS IN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1945-2010')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"8\"></a> <br>\n**EASTER NORTH ORTHODOX**\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church, officially the Orthodox Catholic Church, is the second-largest Christian church, with approximately 260 million baptised members. It operates as a communion of autocephalous churches, each governed by its bishops in local synods,[8] although roughly half of Eastern Orthodox Christians live in Russia. The church has no central doctrinal or governmental authority analogous to the Bishop of Rome, but the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is recognised by all as primus inter pares (\"first among equals\") of the bishops. As one of the oldest surviving religious institutions in the world, the Eastern Orthodox Church has played a prominent role in the history and culture of Eastern and Southeastern Europe, the Caucasus, and the Near East.\n\nEastern Orthodox theology is based on the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (known simply as the Nicene Creed). The church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, and that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles.  It maintains that it practices the original Christian faith, as passed down by holy tradition. Its patriarchates, reminiscent of the pentarchy, and autocephalous and autonomous churches reflect a variety of hierarchical organisation.

The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion, which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury, and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury, whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares (Latin, \"first among equals\"). He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference, chairs the meeting of primates, and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council.  Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by the Anglican Communion also call themselves Anglican, including those that are part of the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment.\n\nAnglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible, traditions of the apostolic Church, apostolic succession (\"historic episcopate\"), and the writings of the Church Fathers. Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity, having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism. These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them, Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions, namely Lutheranism and Calvinism.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.choropleth(national, locations=\"code\",\n                    color=\"christianity_anglican\",\n                    hover_name=\"state\", # column to add to hover information\n                    color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Reds,\n                     animation_frame=\"year\",animation_group=\"code\")\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text = 'ANGLICANS IN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1945-2010')\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"10\"></a> <br>\n**ALL CHRISTIANISM**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.choropleth(national, locations=\"code\",\n                    color=\"christianity_all\",\n                    hover_name=\"state\", # column to add to hover information\n                    color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Reds,\n                     animation_frame=\"year\",animation_group=\"code\")\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text = 'ALL CHRISTIANS IN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1945-2010')\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"11\"></a> <br>\n**JUDAISM**\n\nJudaism (originally from Hebrew יהודה, Yehudah, \"Judah\"; via Latin and Greek) is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people. It is an ancient, monotheistic, Abrahamic religion with the Torah as its foundational text. It encompasses the religion, philosophy, and culture of the Jewish people. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the Children of Israel. It encompasses a wide body of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. The Torah is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or the Hebrew Bible, and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth largest religion in the world.\n\nWithin Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah. Historically, all or part of this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period; the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic. Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism), Conservative Judaism, and Reform Judaism. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to Jewish law, the authority of the Rabbinic tradition, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews. Historically, special courts enforced Jewish law; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary. Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the rabbis and scholars who interpret them.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism\n\n![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2sOzmBAaCHA/maxresdefault.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(\n    y=global_.year,\n    x=global_.judaism_orthodox,\n    name='Judaism Orthodox ',\n    orientation='h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color='rgba(246, 78, 139, 0.6)',\n        line=dict(color='rgba(246, 78, 139, 1.0)', width=3)\n    )\n))\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(\n     y=global_.year,\n     x=global_.judaism_conservative,\n     name='Judaism Conservative ',\n    orientation='h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color='rgba(58, 71, 80, 0.6)',\n        line=dict(color='rgba(58, 71, 80, 1.0)', width=3)\n    )\n))\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(\n     y=global_.year,\n     x=global_.judaism_reform,\n     name='Judaism Reform ',\n    orientation='h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color='rgb(158,202,225)',\n        line=dict(color=\"dodgerblue\", width=3))))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(\n     y=global_.year,\n     x=global_.judaism_other,\n     name='Judaism Other ',\n    orientation='h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color='palegreen',\n        line=dict(color=\"green\", width=3))\n        \n    ))\n\nfig.update_layout(barmode='stack',title=\"Number of Jewish People by Years\",paper_bgcolor='lightgoldenrodyellow',\n              plot_bgcolor='whitesmoke',font=dict(family=\"DejaVu Sans\", size=15,color=\"black\"),\n                xaxis= dict(title= 'Count',ticklen= 5,zeroline= False,zerolinewidth=1,gridcolor=\"tan\"),\n              yaxis= dict(title= 'Years',ticklen= 5,zeroline= False,zerolinewidth=1,gridcolor=\"tan\"))\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"12\"></a> <br>\n**ORTHODOX JUDAISM**\n\nOrthodox Judaism is a collective term for the traditionalist branches of contemporary Judaism. Theologically, it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah, both Written and Oral, as literally revealed by God on Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since. Orthodox Judaism therefore advocates a strict observance of Jewish Law, or halakha, which is to be interpreted and determined only according to traditional methods and in adherence to the continuum of received precedent through the ages. It regards the entire halakhic system as ultimately grounded in immutable revelation, essentially beyond external and historical influence. More than any theoretical issue, obeying the dietary, purity, ethical, and other laws of halakha is the hallmark of Orthodoxy. Other key doctrines include belief in a future bodily resurrection of the dead, divine reward and punishment for the righteous and the sinners, the Election of Israel as a people bound by a covenant with God, and an eventual reign by a salvific Messiah-King who will restore the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nOrthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination. Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained, and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate. Very roughly, it may be divided between Ultra-Orthodox or \"Haredi\", which is more conservative and reclusive, and Modern Orthodox Judaism which is relatively open to outer society. Each of those is itself formed of independent streams. They are almost uniformly exclusionist, regarding Orthodoxy as the only authentic form of Judaism and rejecting all competing non-Orthodox philosophies as illegitimate. While adhering to traditional beliefs, the movement is a modern phenomenon. It arose as a result of the breakdown of the autonomous Jewish community since the 18th century, and was much shaped by a conscious struggle against the pressures of secularization and rival alternatives. The strictly observant and theologically aware Orthodox are a definite minority among all Jews, but there are also numerous semi- and non-practicing persons who are officially affiliated or personally identifying with the movement. In total, Orthodox Judaism is the largest Jewish religious group, estimated to have over 2 million practicing adherents and at least an equal number of nominal members or self-identifying supporters.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.choropleth(national, locations=\"code\",\n                    color=\"judaism_orthodox\",\n                    hover_name=\"state\", \n                    color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Blues,\n                     animation_frame=\"year\",animation_group=\"code\")\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text = 'ORTHODOX JEWISH IN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1945-2010')\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"13\"></a> <br>\n**CONSERVATIVE JUDAISM**\n\nConservative Judaism (known as Masorti Judaism outside North America) is a Jewish religious movement which regards the authority of Jewish law and tradition as emanating primarily from the assent of the people and the community through the generations, more than from divine revelation. It therefore views Jewish law, or Halakha, as both binding and subject to historical development. The Conservative rabbinate employs modern historical-critical research, rather than only traditional methods and sources, and lends great weight to its constituency when determining its stance on matters of practice. The movement considers its approach as the authentic and most appropriate continuation of halakhic discourse, maintaining both fealty to received forms and flexibility in their interpretation. It also eschews strict theological definitions, lacking a consensus in matters of faith and allowing great pluralism.\n\nWhile regarding itself as the heir of Rabbi Zecharias Frankel's 19th-century Positive-Historical School in Europe, Conservative Judaism fully institutionalized only in the United States during the mid-20th century. Its largest center today is in North America, where its main congregational arm is the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and the New York–based Jewish Theological Seminary of America operates as its largest rabbinic seminary.

A liberal strand of Judaism, it is characterized by a lessened stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as non-binding and the individual Jew as autonomous, and openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lie in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates. Since the 1970s, the movement has adopted a policy of inclusiveness and acceptance, inviting as many as possible to partake in its communities. It is strongly identified with progressive political and social agendas, mainly under the traditional Jewish rubric Tikkun Olam, or \"Repairing of the World\". Tikkun Olam is a central motto of Reform Judaism, and action for its sake is one of the main channels for adherents to express their affiliation.

Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as Sanātana Dharma, \"the eternal tradition\", or the \"eternal way\", beyond human history. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \"Hindu synthesis\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE, after the end of the Vedic period (1500 to 500 BCE),and flourished in the medieval period, with the decline of Buddhism in India.\n\nAlthough Hinduism contains a broad range of philosophies, it is linked by shared concepts, recognisable rituals, cosmology, shared textual resources, and pilgrimage to sacred sites. Hindu texts are classified into Śruti (\"heard\") and Smṛti (\"remembered\"). These texts discuss theology, philosophy, mythology, Vedic yajna, Yoga, agamic rituals, and temple building, among other topics. Major scriptures include the Vedas and Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, and the Āgamas. Sources of authority and eternal truths in its texts play an important role, but there is also a strong Hindu tradition of questioning authority in order to deepen the understanding of these truths and to further develop the tradition. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism\n\n![](https://img-s1.onedio.com/id-5abe5a0102c608151815535c/rev-0/w-635/f-jpg-webp/s-aa0c2b0cd766c65438703a92acd930922612a60b.webp)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.choropleth(national, locations=\"code\",\n                    color=\"hinduism_all\",\n                    hover_name=\"state\", \n                     color_continuous_scale='Magma',\n                     animation_frame=\"year\",animation_group=\"code\")\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text = 'ALL HINDUISTS IN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1945-2010')\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Sikhism **  \n\nfrom Sikh, meaning a \"disciple\", \"seeker,\" or \"learner\"), is a monotheistic religion that originated in the Punjab region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent around the end of the 15th century.It is one of the youngest of the major world religions and the world's fifth largest organized religion, as well as being the world's ninth-largest overall religion. The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the sacred scripture Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator, divine unity and equality of all humankind, engaging in selfless service, striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life. In the early 21st century, there were nearly 25 million Sikhs worldwide, the great majority of them living in Punjab, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nSikhism is based on the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak, the first Guru (1469–1539), and the nine Sikh gurus that succeeded him. The Tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, terminating the line of human Gurus and making the scripture the eternal, religious spiritual guide for Sikhs.

Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified religion, but rather to a collection of native beliefs and mythology. Shinto today is the religion of public shrines devoted to the worship of a multitude of \"spirits\", \"essences\" or \"gods\" (kami), suited to various purposes such as war memorials and harvest festivals, and applies as well to various sectarian organizations. Practitioners express their diverse beliefs through a standard language and practice, adopting a similar style in dress and ritual, dating from around the time of the Nara and Heian periods (8th–12th centuries).\n\nThe word Shinto (Way of the Gods) was adopted, originally as Jindō or Shindō, from the written Chinese Shendao (神道, pinyin: shéndào), combining two kanji: shin (神), meaning \"spirit\" or kami; and michi (道), \"path\", meaning a philosophical path or study (from the Chinese word dào). The oldest recorded usage of the word Shindo is from the second half of the 6th century. Kami is rendered in English as \"spirits\", \"essences\", or \"gods\", and refers to the energy generating the phenomena.Since the Japanese language does not distinguish between singular and plural, kami also refers to the singular divinity, or sacred essence, that manifests in multiple forms: rocks, trees, rivers, animals, objects, places, and people can be said to possess the nature of kami. Kami and people are not separate; they exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto\n\n\n**Taoism**\n\nTaoism  or Daoism  is a philosophical or religious tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: Dào; literally: 'the Way', also romanized as Dao). The Tao is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists. Taoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order, but is similar in the sense that it is a teaching about the various disciplines for achieving \"perfection\" by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe called \"the way\" or \"dao\".Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize wu wei (action without intention), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: 慈 \"compassion\", 儉 \"frugality\", and 不敢為天下先 \"humility\".\n\nThe roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture, the I Ching, which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The \"Legalist\" Shen Buhai (c. 400 – c. 337 BCE) may also have been a major influence, expounding a realpolitik of wu wei. The Tao Te Ching, a compact book containing teachings attributed to Laozi (老子; Lǎozǐ; Lao³ Tzŭ³), is widely considered the keystone work of the Taoist tradition, together with the later writings of Zhuangzi.\n\nTaoism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries, and Taoists (道士; dàoshi, \"masters of the Tao\"), a title traditionally attributed only to the clergy and not to their lay followers, usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the practices of Chinese folk religion and non-Taoist vernacular ritual orders, which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to Taoism. Chinese alchemy (especially neidan), Chinese astrology, Chan (Zen) Buddhism, several martial arts, traditional Chinese medicine, feng shui, and many styles of qigong have been intertwined with Taoism throughout history. Beyond China, Taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in Asia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism\n\n\n**Confucianism **\n\nConfucianism, also known as Ruism, is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life.Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang (c. 1600–1046 BCE) and Zhou dynasties (c. 1046–256 BCE). In the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the \"proto-Taoist\" Huang–Lao as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism.\n\nA Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty (618–907). In the late Tang, Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism. This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar official class in the Song dynasty (960–1297). The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the \"Three Principles of the People\" with the establishment of the Republic of China, and then Maoism under the People's Republic of China. In the late twentieth century Confucian work ethic has been credited with the rise of the East Asian economy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"19\"></a> <br>\n### **Jainism, Bahaism, Zoroastrianism, Syncretism, Animism and Other Religion Believers and Nonbelievers**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Jainism**\n\nJainism  traditionally known as Jain Dharma is an ancient Indian religion. Followers of Jainism are called \"Jains\", a word derived from the Sanskrit word jina (victor) who connotes the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths by destroying the karma through an ethical and spiritual life.[3] Jainism is a transtheistic religion, and Jains trace their spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as tirthankaras, with the first being Rishabhanatha, who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, as Matsya the twenty-third being Parshvanatha in 900 BCE, and twenty-fourth being the Mahāvīra around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism\n\n**Bahaism**\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith  is a religion teaching the essential worth of all religions, and the unity and equality of all people. Established by Bahá'u'lláh in 1863, it initially grew in Persia and parts of the Middle East, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception. It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents, known as Bahá'ís, spread out into most of the world's countries and territories.\n\nIt grew from the mid-19th-century Bábí religion, whose founder (the Báb) taught that God would soon send a prophet in the same way of Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bahá'u'lláh (1817–1892) announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Acre in Ottoman Palestine. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son `Abdu'l-Bahá (1844–1921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897–1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, which sits in Haifa, Israel, near the Shrine of the Báb. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith\n\n**Zoroastrianism**\n\nZoroastrianism or Mazdayasna is one of the world's oldest continuously practiced religions. It is a heterodox yet orthopraxic faith centered in a dualistic cosmology of good and evil and an eschatology predicting the ultimate conquest of evil with theological elements of henotheism, monotheism/monism, and polytheism. Ascribed to the teachings of the Iranian-speaking spiritual leader Zoroaster (also known as Zarathushtra), it exalts an uncreated and benevolent deity of wisdom, Ahura Mazda (Wise Lord), as its supreme being. Major features of Zoroastrianism, such as messianism, judgment after death, heaven and hell, and free will may have influenced other religious and philosophical systems, including Second Temple Judaism, Gnosticism, Greek philosophy, Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Buddhism.\n\nWith possible roots dating back to the second millennium BCE, Zoroastrianism enters recorded history in the 5th century BCE. Along with a Mithraic Median prototype and a Zurvanist Sassanid successor, it served as the state religion of the pre-Islamic Iranian empires for more than a millennium, from around 600 BCE to 650 CE. Zoroastrianism declined from the 7th century onwards following the Muslim conquest of Persia of 633–654. Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians at around 110,000-120,000, with most living in India and in Iran; their number has been thought to be declining. Besides the Zoroastrian diaspora, the older disputed Mithraic faith Yazdânism is still practised amongst Kurds.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism\n\n**Syncretism**\n\nSyncretism  is the combining of different beliefs, while blending practices of various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. Syncretism also occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture (known as eclecticism) as well as politics (syncretic politics). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism\n\n**Animism**\n\nAnimism (from Latin anima, \"breath, spirit, life\")is the religious belief that objects, places and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence. Potentially, animism perceives all things—animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork and perhaps even words—as animated and alive. Animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of many indigenous peoples, especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of organised religions.\n\nAlthough each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals, \"animism\" is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples' \"spiritual\" or \"supernatural\" perspectives. The animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most indigenous peoples that they often do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to \"animism\" (or even \"religion\"); the term is an anthropological construct.\n\nAnimism encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency, that there exists no hard and fast distinction between the spiritual and physical (or material) world and that soul or spirit or sentience exists not only in humans, but also in other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment. Animism may further attribute a life force to abstract concepts such as words, true names or metaphors in mythology. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists (such as author Daniel Quinn, sculptor Lawson Oyekan and many contemporary Pagans)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"trace1 = go.Scatter(\n                      x = global_.year,\n
