Introduction: Data Analytics in Insurance\nEmerging technologies like AI, Machine Learning, Block Chain, Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics have brought a radical change in today's global financial landscape. As traditional business models adapt and evolve to harness the promise of these technologies, and the barriers between various 'specialized' domains across industries slowly dissolve, more and more industries are adopting a Digital Transformation Strategy. Insurance is no exception.\n\nThe Insurance sector is no stranger to data driven decision making. Yet AI and Big Data are revolutionizing the industry. The following image briefly illustrates the digital transformation in Insurance today, and the role played by Analytics:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnirbanDatta87/Projects/master/P1_EDA/img/1_ins.jpg\" width=\"900\">\n\nIn this project, we attempt to analyze and explore a dataset for medical costs in Health Insurance in USA in order to derive valuable insights, and find answers to questions through statistical hypothesis testing."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.1.
