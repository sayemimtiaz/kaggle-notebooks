I therefore conclude this kernel(notebook) by thanking you for your time. As a bonus, here are a few interesting future steps that lack of space unfortunately prevents us from exploring.\n\n1. Build Models based on the most highly correlated variables\n\n2. Compare the above models with a model that uses all variables in the dataset.\n\n3. Use a Bayesian approach to statistical modeling to see how well this would compare to what we have.\n\n4. Improve the visualizations.\n\n5. Experiment with more \"advanced models\"(knns, svms, random forests, xgboost, adaboost, etc)\n\n6. Deploy  a real world model and see how this works on an actual real world problem.\n\n\n**Thank you for reading and do provide feeback on what works and what doesn't.** You can contact me via my Github [repo](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/sweetpy) or by email(via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gonnel)'s) contact me .\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
