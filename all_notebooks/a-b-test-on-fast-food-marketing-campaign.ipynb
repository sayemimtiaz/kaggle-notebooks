However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.\n\nOur first major focus on 3 size of Market campaign:\n- Small\n- Medium\n- Large\n\nOur second major focus on 3 promotional strategies:\n1. Collectibles - Fast food companies can drive sales through collectibles, particularly those that kids enjoy. For instance, a popular animated film, dolls, glasses or other mementos that are related to the movie. The owners decided to provide one free item for the purchase of the vegan patty burger. This fast food marketing strategies entices people to come back until they have all the collectibles.\n\n2. Societal Marketing - It includes volunteering or collecting money or items for charity. Consumers who relate to our ideas and values due to our charitable work may, in turn, patronize our fast food restaurant.\n\n3. Loyalty Programs - Frequency card programs are a popular type of loyalty program for fast food restaurants. The owners plan to invite people to fill out an application and reward them according to the frequency in which they order the particular product. They planned on giving a free drink after their first four orders, then free fries after their next four orders. Ultimately, a customer could earn a free meal after 12 orders.\n\nDetailed description of dataset content is described in the following link:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/marketing-campaign-eff-usec_-fastf/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# LIBRARY","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data Processing\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Data Visualizing\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import MaxNLocator\nfrom IPython.display import display, HTML\n\n# Math\nfrom scipy import stats  # Computing the t and p values using scipy \nfrom statsmodels.stats import weightstats \n\n# Warning Removal\nimport warnings\ndef ignore_warn(*args, **kwargs):\n    pass\nwarnings.warn = ignore_warn #ignore annoying warning (from sklearn and seaborn)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# DATA EXPLORATION","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/WA_Fn-UseC_-Marketing-Campaign-Eff-UseC_-FastF.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Analysis of the Target feature (SaleInThousands)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### MarketID and MarketSize\n- Any MarketID is accompanied by only one MarketSize\n- MarketID with MarketSize of Large and Small place on the top Sales, while those with MarketSize of Medium come last.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.DataFrame(df.groupby(['MarketID', 'MarketSize'])['SalesInThousands'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### MarketSize and A Number of Campains in each MarketSize and SaleInThousands\n- MarketSize with Large label account for most Sale, followed by Small and the last is Medium size.
