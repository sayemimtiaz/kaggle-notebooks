Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).

Each row in the data represents a football player currently playing in the EPL and the columns are featured used to discribe players' data and game statistics. There are 571 rows and 59 columns in the data. Few of the columns are:\n\n* Name: Name of the player\n* Jersey Number: Number at the back of his shirt\n* Club: Club the player plays for at present\n* Position: Playing position(Goalkeeper, Defender, Mid-fider, Forward)\n* Nationality: Country the player is from\n* Age: Players age\n* Appearances: Number of games played (a substitute appearance aslo counts)\n* Wins: Number of games the palyer has won\n* Losses: Number of games the palyer has lost\n* Goals: Number of goals the player has scored in the EPL \n* Goals per match: Goals scored per game, etcetra.\n\n\n**Note** : A player's attributes from previous premier league clubs are carried to his current club. \n\n**Note** : When all-time stats are considered obviously longevity plays a big role. The longer ther playe has played in the EPL, the higher the stats are going to be. Hence the per-game stat will be a better indicator of performance. On the other hand players who played too few games might appear as top-performers. For this reason only players who played at least 38 games are considered (a full-season's worth of games) in the per-game comparison.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from itertools import repeat\nimport numpy as np \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(\"img/picture.png\")\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        ","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/premier-league-player-statistics-updated-daily/dataset - 2020-09-24.csv')\ndata = data.copy()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 0.4 Data pre-processing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remove entries which do not have age, jersey number and nationality \ndata = data[data['Nationality'].notna()]\ndata = data[data['Age'].notna()]\ndata = data[data['Jersey Number'].notna()]","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data['Cross accuracy %'] = data['Cross accuracy %'].str.replace(r'%', '').astype(float)\ndata['Shooting accuracy %'] = data['Shooting accuracy %'].str.replace(r'%', '').astype(float)\ndata['Tackle success %'] = data['Tackle success %'].str.replace(r'%', '').astype(float)\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment', None)\nfeatures = data.columns\n\ndatta = data[features]\ndatta.head()\n\ndatta_appNonZero = datta[datta['Appearances'] > 0] #prevents division by zero for players who are yet to make appearances\n\n# take care off the data type for division\n# separate cols with dtype objects and cols that may not be divided by appearances\ncols = features.drop(['Age', 'Name', 'Appearances', 'Club', 'Nationality', 'Jersey Number', 'Cross accuracy %', 'Position', 'Goals per match', \n                      'Passes per match','Tackle success %', 'Shooting accuracy %'])\ndatta_appNonZero.loc[:, cols] = datta_appNonZero.loc[:, cols].div(datta_appNonZero['Appearances'], axis=0)\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# positional classifications on the data as is\ngoalies = data[data['Position'] == 'Goalkeeper']\ndefenders = data[data['Position'] == 'Defender']\nmidfielders = data[data['Position'] == 'Midfielder']\nforwards = data[data['Position'] == 'Forward']","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# palyers who have made atleast 38 games (a seasons worth games)\n# data as is\ndata_38app = data[data['Appearances'] >=38]\ngoalies_38app = goalies[goalies['Appearances'] >= 38]\ndefenders_38app = defenders[defenders['Appearances'] >= 38]\nmidfilders_38app = midfielders[midfielders['Appearances'] >= 38]\nforwards_38app = forwards[forwards['Appearances'] >= 38]","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# palyers who have made atleast 38 games (a seasons worth games)\n# data normalized\nall_players = datta_appNonZero[datta_appNonZero['Appearances'] >= 38]\ngoalies_ = datta_appNonZero[(datta_appNonZero['Position'] == 'Goalkeeper') & (datta_appNonZero['Appearances'] >= 38)]\ndefenders_ = datta_appNonZero[(datta_appNonZero['Position'] == 'Defender') & (datta_appNonZero['Appearances'] >= 38)]\nmidfielders_ = datta_appNonZero[(datta_appNonZero['Position'] == 'Midfielder') & (datta_appNonZero['Appearances'] >= 38)]\nforwards_ = datta_appNonZero[(datta_appNonZero['Position'] == 'Forward') & (datta_appNonZero['Appearances'] >= 38)]","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

That means defend well and do not concede a goal. For that to happen derenders play a huge part. Good defenders are able to read the game very well and sense where the danger is in time. They know when to join the party (attacking) or sit back and defend. Although they are rare to find, there are defenders who can do more that their of job by for example assisting goals and scoring themselves as well. Let's see who are best defenders at doing their job and who are contributing more that they are needed to.\n\nExtra points:\nMost expensive defender in the EPL:\n1.

No wonder Pep Guardiola has shown him the doors when he took-over at Manchester City.\n- Phil Jagielka love his own net, i.e has more own goals.\n- No wonder Mark Nobel is the biggest losser with so many recards to his name.\n- Wondered how many times Gabriel Jesus calls his own name? 0.56 time per game (that is his big chances missed per game)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"unwanted_records = ['Losses', 'Big chances missed','Own goals','Errors leading to goal', 'Red cards'] \ncol=2\nrow=5\n\ntop = 5\nfig = make_subplots(\n    rows=5, cols=2,\n    subplot_titles=('Losses (overall)', 'Losses (per-game)','Big chances missed (overall)','Big chances missed (per-game)',\n                    'Own goals (overall)','Own goals (per-game)', 'Errors leading to goal (overall)',\n                    'Errors leading to goal (per-game)','Red cards (overall)', 'Red cards (per-game)'))\n\nfor i, atr in enumerate(unwanted_records):\n    df = data_38app.sort_values(atr, ascending=False).head(top)\n    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=df['Name'], \n         y=-df[atr],\n         orientation='v'),\n         row=i+1, col=1)\n\nfor j, atr in enumerate(unwanted_records):    \n    df = all_players.sort_values(atr, ascending=False).head(top)\n    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=df['Name'], \n         y=-df[atr],\n         orientation='v'),\n         row=j+1, col=2)\n       \n    fig.update_traces(marker_color= ['rgb(255, 0, 0)'],\n                  marker_line_width=2.5, opacity=0.6)\n\nfig.update_layout(title_text='<b> List of the unfortunates <b>',\n                  titlefont={'size': 28, 'family':'Courier'},\n                  showlegend=False,\n                  autosize=False, \n                  width=1200, height=1100,\n                  paper_bgcolor='lightgray',\n                  plot_bgcolor='lightgray',\n                 )\niplot(fig)\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Closing Remarks:\n\n- This exploration was a simple EDA and a point on a learning-curve in data visualizations.\n- Short summaries are given under each section in the notebook so no point repeating them here.\n- Learned to explore a dataset and along the way studied and practiced data-viz using Plotly visualization library.\n","metadata":{"trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##  <span style= 'background:skyblue'> Thank you for reading! </span>  ","metadata":{"trusted":true}}]}
