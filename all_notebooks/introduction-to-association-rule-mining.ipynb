We will first go through a brief Exploratory Data Analysis and then implement one of most popular Association Rule Learning Model. The aim of this dataset is to identify the association rules for the Market Basket Analysis. \n\nAssociation Rule Learning (or Associate Rule Mining) is a rule-based machine learning method to discover how items are associated to each other. Stores use them to figure out products that are bought together, this way they can provide different offers to the different customers e.g, buy one get one free. Earlier, recommendation systems like Amazon, Netflix used them.

Therefore, we will now use association rules to find pairs of items that are associated to each other.\n\n\n# Associate Rule Learning\n\nAssociation rule learning is a technique to discover how items are associated to each other. Association can be measured in three common ways.\n\n## Support\n\nIt tell us about how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. It is measured as follows:\n\nFor Movie Recommendation, we calculate it as:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nsupport(M) = \\frac{\\text{number of user watchlists containing M}}{\\text{total number of user watchlists}}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwheras for Market Basket Optimization, we calculate it as:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nsupport(I) = \\frac{\\text{number of transactions containing I}}{\\text{total number of transactions}}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n## Confidence\n\nIt tell us about how likely item B is purchased when item A is purchased, expressed as {A -> B}. It is measured as follows:\n\nFor Movie Recommendation, we calculate it as:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nconfidence(M_1\\rightarrow{M_2}) = \\frac{\\text{number of user watchlists containing $M_1$ and $M_2$}}{\\text{number of user watchlists containing $M_1$}}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwheras for Market Basket Optimization, we calculate it as:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nconfidence(I_1\\rightarrow{I_2}) = \\frac{\\text{number of transactions containing $I_1$ and $I_2$}}{\\text{number of transactions containing $I_1$}}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n## Lift\n\nIt tell us about how likely the item B is purchased when the item A is purchased while controlling for how popular item B is. It is measured as follows:\n\nFor Movie Recommendation, we calculate it as:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nlift(M_1\\rightarrow{M_2}) = \\frac{Confidence(M_1\\rightarrow{M_2})}{Support(M_2)}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\nwheras for Market Basket Optimization, we calculate it as:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\nlift(I_1\\rightarrow{I_2}) = \\frac{Confidence(I_1\\rightarrow{I_2})}{Support(I_2)}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n\n## Apriori\n\nApriori algorithm consist of:\n\n1. Step 1: Set a minimum support and confidence.\n2. Step 2: Take all the subsets in transactions having higher support than minimum support.\n3. Step 3: Take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than minimum confidence.\n4. Step 4: Sort the rules by decreasing lift.\n\nWe will be using `apriori` function from `apyori` package to implement the apriori algorithm.
