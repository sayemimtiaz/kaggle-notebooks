Therefore we conducted a few unstructured interviews with policy-makers, ethics counselors, and front-line medical practitioners in order to better understand what are their biggest needs and how our work could be most helpful for them. The details that experts shared with us informed the data exploration and modeling presented in this notebook.\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to link public health measures and social and ethical concerns for individual articles in the corpus. In order to extract such information, we will utilize a language grammar. In our case we've defined a grammar that aims to capture how the literature discusses **factors such as the enablers, barriers, and implications of different public health measures**. Our current grammar is in English but our language grammar approach could be evolved into covering other languages as well.\n\nUltimately, we hope that we are able to **highlight how others have been able to address social and ethical considerations during critical pandemic response efforts**. In this way we aim to inform the decision-makers, ethicists who might be part of a hospital ethics committee, or other individuals who need to navigate difficult decisions.\n\n## Contents\n\n1.

\n  Nurses may be forced to work without adequate personal protective equipment to keep them safe. Should they be expected to risk their lives?\n  * Who makes the decision on who are the \"critical workers\" that need to be working?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# Approach"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here we describe the technical approach that lead to these findings.

For example: (1) country or continent, (2) time, and (3) severity of the pandemic which is being discussed in the paper. The reason for doing this is that if we don't do it many of the answers to the questions might be misleading as they cannot easily generalize over a large number of dynamic factors. The answers of these questions are contextual and depend on many sociocultural factors. For example we need to consider that:\n* Cultural differences between countries around the world will influence what public health measures are implemented.\n* Many of the papers in our dataset refer to previous pandemics. It will be important to compare between pandemics as the context has changed immensely.\n* The severity of the pandemic will impact the measures being considered during the emergency response efforts.\n\nIn future work, we hope to be able to extract this contextual information and make it easier for decision-makers to understand it.\n\n## Improving the grammar\nThe language grammar NLU approach is very powerful and utilized by many chatbot systems. We hope to continue work on refining the grammar we use in order to capture the complex language structures which are often used in research articles.\n\n## Topic Modeling and building a knowledge graph\nWe aim to also explore a topic modelling approach in order to identify social and ethical concerns across the entire corpus. \nUltimately, we want to build a knowledge graph where concepts of public health measures will be associated with concepts relating to social and ethical concerns. Using a graph based approach could allow for extracting insights based on multiple articles altogether vs extracting grammar matches on individual articles. \n\n**We hope our research findings will meaningfully contribute to the COVID-19 outbreak response efforts by providing decision-makers and policy-makers with examples of how others have navigated the complex social and ethical challenges posed by this Kaggle task.**"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
