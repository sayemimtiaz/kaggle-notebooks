Building a model that only uses word frequency is possible, but we lose the meaning of the text, which also contains useful information. Therefore, we will instead move to a Word2Vec + LSTM solution, capable of grasping this meaning. We will start by implementing the Word2Vec part.\n# Word2Vec\n\nWord2Vec is a very popular word embedding technique which uses neural network, and that was developed in 2013 by Google.\nThere are two way of using the word embedding:\n1. Using word embedding in an unsupervised way: This means that, based on the sentences we have, the model tries to capture the context of a word in a document, that is, the relation to other words, semantic and syntactic similarities, etc...\n2. Using word embedding as a first layer in the neural network/LSTM. This means that the weights are learned through backpropagation of the classification error. Therefore, weights are learned by backpropagating the classification error. The model does not necessarily try to capture the context of a word in a document, it adjusts the weights only in such a way as to reduce loss. \n\n\n**We will use here the first method.** It is faster because the embedding only needs to be done once, and not on each iteration of the LSTM training. An advantage of the first method is the possibility of using pre-trained models, that is, models which have already associated the words with vectors.
