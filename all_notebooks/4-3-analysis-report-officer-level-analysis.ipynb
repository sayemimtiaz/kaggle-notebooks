It explains the process and flow of automation, standardization, processing, and analysis of data. In the *second kernel*, the first component of the solution pipeline : data integration and processing is implemented. It processes both core level data as well as department level data. In the *third kernel*, this pipeline is executed and run for several departments. After all the standardized and clean data is produced, it is analysed with different formats of the Analysis Framework in 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 kernels. In *kernel 4.1*, core analysis is done along with link with crime rate and poverty data. In *kernel 4.2*, core analysis is done along with statistical analysis. In *kernel 4.3*, officer level analysis is done. \n\n<hr>\n\nThis kernel, is the fourth of the series.

Key Highlights <hr></font>\n\nOfficer level data is not shared by every department, but if shared it can be used to analyse the racial bias from a different perspective - officer attributes. In this kernel, I have shared the analysis done from the officer level attributes. Following are the key highlights of the analysis: \n\n- Officers having age less than 30 have used force more on blacks than whites among the total subjects which they encountered.  \n- Recently recruited officers tend to show some level of racial bias, as their use-of-force on blacks is much higher than that of whites.  \n- More experienced officers have used force more on whites than blacks, indicating that this agegroup does not shows very high racial bias specifically on black population.  \n- Use of force severity is highest on hispanics, followed by blacks and then whites.  \n- The most significant factors that affects the severity of use of force are about race of the subject and years of experience of the officer.  \n\n\n\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2. Racial Bias : Officer Level Analysis <hr></font>\n\nAll the analysis is first done at high level and then by controlling the socio-econometric or demographic factors of the area which the department serves.

For example, the first statistics : percentage of UOF on blacks is more than whites. I created a following table (which can be fine tuned with iterative runs and domain knowledge) which can be used to normalize the statistical scores, for example in this case, the percentage of officers whose UOF on blacks is more than whites is 62%, so it turns out to be 8.5\n\n<table>\n    <tr><td>**Statistical Measure** </td> <td> **Range** </td> <td> **Normalized Score** </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 0 - 10 </td> <td> 1 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 10 - 20 </td> <td> 3 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 20 - 30 </td> <td> 5 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 30 - 40 </td> <td> 6 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 40 - 50 </td> <td> 7 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 50 - 60 </td> <td> 8.0 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 60 - 70 </td> <td> 8.5 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 70 - 80 </td> <td> 9 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 80 - 90 </td> <td> 9.5 </td>  </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 90 - 100 </td> <td> 10 </td>  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSimilar tables can be developed and improved for other statistics as well. And finally, weights can be decided for every statistics. For example - \n\n<table>\n    <tr><td>**Statistical Measure**</td> <td> **Weight** </td> </tr>\n    <tr><td> UOF_officers : blacks > whites </td> <td> 0.40 </td> </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : only_on_blacks </td> <td> 0.30 </td> </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : whites > blacks </td> <td> 0.20 </td> </tr>\n    <tr><td>UOF_officers : large_difference </td> <td> 0.10 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nSo in this case, the normalized racial score for Indianapolis department can be calculated as following: \n\nnormalized scores : 8.5 for UOF_officers : blacks > whites, 6 for UOF_officers : only_on_blacks, 7 for UOF_officers : whites > blacks, and 4 for UOF_officers : large_difference\n\n8.5 ( 0.40 ) + 6 ( 0.35 ) + 7 ( 0.20 ) + 4 ( 0.10 ) = 7.3 \n\n## Racial Disparity Score (Indianapolis) = 7.3 / 10 \n\nA similar score can be calculated for other departments and can be shared in their reports which help the departments understand where and till what level's they need to improve. \n\n<a id=\"2.8\"></a>\n## <font color=\"#703bdb\">2.8 Measuring Racial Bias : Use of Force Severity <hr></font>\n\nOne insight to measure racial bias in the department can be about Severity of Force Used and checking it which race has the highest severity on an average.

I refered one of the CPE report to came up with this type of weighing. \n\n<table>\n    <tr> <td>** Use of Force Type** </td> <td> **Severity Score** </td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Physical Use of Force</td> <td> 1 </td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Canine</td> <td> 2 </td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Use of CS/OC </td> <td> 3.5 </td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Less Lethal </td> <td> 5 </td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Lethal Handgun </td> <td> 8 </td> <tr>\n    <tr> <td>Lethal Vehicle </td> <td> 10 </td> <tr>\n</table>\n\nBased on this weighing, we can plot the average severity of use of force by different race of the subjects. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"123ca6d2e33c605f089de615ec56d09e88aff2cc","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"severity_score = {}\nfor x in events_df[\"TYPE_OF_FORCE_USED\"].value_counts().index:\n    if x.startswith(\"Physical\"):\n        severity_score[x] = 1\n    elif x.startswith(\"Canine\"):\n        severity_score[x] = 2\n    elif \"CS/OC\" in x:\n        severity_score[x] = 4.5\n    elif x.startswith(\"Less Lethal\"):\n        severity_score[x] = 5\n    elif x == \"Lethal-Vehicle\":\n        severity_score[x] = 10\n    elif x.startswith(\"Lethal\"):\n        severity_score[x] = 8\n\nevents_df = events_df[~events_df[\"TYPE_OF_FORCE_USED\"].isna()]\nevents_df[\"uof_severity\"] = events_df[\"TYPE_OF_FORCE_USED\"].apply(lambda x : severity_score[x])\nt1 = events_df[events_df['INCIDENT_YEAR'] == 2015].groupby(\"SUBJECT_RACE\").agg({\"uof_severity\" : \"mean\" }).reset_index()\n\ntrace1 = go.Bar(x = t1.SUBJECT_RACE[2:], y=t1.uof_severity[2:], name=\"Average Severity\", \n                marker=dict(color=\"gray\", opacity = 0.4))\n\nlayout = go.Layout(title='Use-of-Force Average Severity by Race of the Subject', height=400,\n                   legend=dict(orientation=\"h\", x=0.1, y=1.17), \n                  yaxis=dict(range=(0.85, 2.3)))\nfig = go.Figure(data=[trace1], layout=layout)\niplot(fig, filename='style-bar')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"979b48e23359ce8a5e5ce4c140822724798648cf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> -
