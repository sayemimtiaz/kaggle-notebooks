Almost one-third of adults are HIV-positive. The country is also severely affected by a tuberculosis (TB) epidemic and around 70 per cent of all TB patients are co-infected with HIV.\n\nAlongside this, the first confirmed patient with COVID-19 was diagnosed in Eswatini on 14 March; since then, the number of patients with COVID-19 has grown daily.\n\nWhile it remains unclear how COVID-19 will impact people living with HIV, it is known that patients with existing chronic illnesses and weakened immune systems are more at risk. TB is a disease that attacks the lungs, like the new coronavirus COVID-19, and it is therefore likely that TB patients will suffer more severe forms and worse complications if they become infected.\n\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been fighting the dual HIV/TB epidemic in Eswatini since 2007. Dr Bernhard Kerschberger, MSF Head of Mission in Eswatini, describes the challenges his team face responding to COVID-19 in a setting with high rates of HIV and TB, and how adapting care for patients is important to reduce the risk of exposure for the most vulnerable people.https://www.msf.org/responding-covid-19-eswatini","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#You can Make History.

However, people living with advanced HIV, that have low levels of CD4 (infection fighting cells) and high viral loads, or that are not on antiretroviral treatment (ARVs) are likely more at risk of infection in general and need to exercise caution to avoid contracting the virus.\n\nThey don’t yet have much experience in treating COVID-19 infections in TB patients, but it is very likely that people with both TB and COVID-19 are more at risk and may have poorer treatment outcomes (due to lung damage).\n\nIt is important that people with TB, high viral load levels of HIV or other co-infections do all they can to avoid getting COVID-19.

In Eswatini, MSF has been working for years with community-based models of care, to provide better access to care for patients in rural areas. Now, to reduce the risk of contact for patients, they are bringing care even closer to their homes, to limit visits to health centres and unnecessary journeys by public transport.\n\nAmong the most at-risk patients are those suffering from multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). To protect them, they have started using new technology called Video Observed Therapy (VOT).\n\nThis means that patients who had to be supervised in person by a community member or health worker when taking their medication (as per the treatment protocol) now film themselves taking their medicine with a smartphone. They provide them with a smartphone that is equipped with a secure application through which they can send the video to a nurse. The nurse checks the video and follows up with the patient if there is a problem or if the video does not arrive. They are currently treating 40 MDR-TB patients, the majority of whom will be using VOT.https://www.msf.org/responding-covid-19-eswatini","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"covid19 = df2[(df2['Disease']=='COVID-19')].reset_index(drop=True)\ncovid19.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#A mobile TB clinic for MDR-TB patients (Multidrug resistant)\n\nThey have also put into place a small mobile TB clinic for MDR-TB patients, consisting of a driver and a nurse, which visits patients at their homes to carry out medical check-ups, and bring them food and refills of drugs. Before, patients had to pick up their food and drugs at the health centres.\n\nMost of their stable HIV patients with suppressed viral loads now receive six-monthly refills of ARVs, so they don’t have to go to the health centre every month. For patients with TB and other chronic conditions, they provide medication for one to three months, depending on their health condition and the availability of drugs.\n\nMSF now provides counselling and treatment support sessions for patients and medical consultations with doctors for those who need it by telephone. The countrywide partial lockdown put in place by the government has forced us to pause our preventive activities, such as mobile HIV testing points at events, workplaces and community gatherings.

It could potentially also affect the HIV/TB epidemic in the long-run.\n\nIt has been a long battle for Eswatini to break the HIV transmission curve and surpass the international 90-90-90 target (where at least 90 per cent of people know their HIV status, 90 per cent people that are HIV-positive are on ARVs and 90 per cent of these are virally suppressed). If the medical strategies that allowed this to happen are not maintained, it is a sad possibility that those gains might be reversed. It is therefore important that basic prevention, testing and treatment services are maintained to ensure people who need to test and access care are able to.\n\nThe number of patients that started HIV treatment in MSF-supported healthcare clinics fell by 64 per cent (from 44 to 16) in April, compared to the same month last year. This is the lowest recorded monthly number in the past four years. As they had to reduce their activities in the community because of the lockdown measures, they distributed 46 per cent fewer HIV self-testing kits in April (from 298 to 162) compared to last year.\n\nIn the short-term, they don’t know what impact this will have, but in the long-term, it could prose a real and worrying problem.https://www.msf.org/responding-covid-19-eswatini","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20,4))\nplt.subplot(131)\nsns.countplot(x= 'Minimum_Incubation', data = df2, palette=\"Greens_r\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.subplot(132)\nsns.countplot(x= 'Maximum_Incubation', data = df2, palette=\"Reds_r\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.subplot(133)\nsns.countplot(x= 'Host_for_Parasite', data = df2, palette=\"Blues_r\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20,4))\nplt.subplot(131)\nsns.countplot(x= 'Age_Group', data = df2, palette=\"Oranges\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.subplot(132)\nsns.countplot(x= 'Source', data = df2, palette=\"summer\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#What are your main concerns about COVID-19 and the response in Eswatini?\n\nThe potential impact of COVID-19 on the Eswatini health system is a major concern here, just like it is elsewhere in the world.

Another worry are the indirect impacts of COVID-19, particularly the socio-economic consequences. Most people here are quite poor and live in rural areas. This is one reason why the rate of TB is so high, as it disproportionately affects poorer people forced to live in crowded households with poor ventilation.\n\nManaging diseases like HIV and TB on a daily basis is already difficult and now the restrictions in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 will make patients’ lives even harder.
