This means that the model correctly predicted the direction for 611 weeks out of the 1089 for an accuracy of 0.5611. While this seems to be better than random chance, it is important to note that the model was trained on the entire data set, so 0.5611 is the *training* accuracy. Moreover, a naive strategy of simply saying that every week will be an up week would have resulted in 605 correctly predicted weeks out of 1089, which is a very similar level of overall accuracy.\n\nTo look a little closer at the confusion matrix, let's assume that our goal is to correctly predict when the market will go up. In this case, up weeks will be considered as positive ($+$) and down weeks as negative ($-$). Having set this convention, we can now consider four important quantities associated with the confusion matrix: true positive rate (i.e. *sensitivity* or *recall*), false positive rate, positive predictive value (i.e. *precision*), and negative predictive value. The true positive rate is the number of correctly predicted positives divided by the overall number of positives -- the number of correctly predicted up weeks (557) over the total number of up weeks (605) for a value of $557/605 \\approx 0.92$ for this model. While this is a pretty high value, which is good, the false positive rate -- the number of incorrectly predicted positives (weeks incorrectly predicted to be up weeks = 430 weeks) divided by the overall number of negatives (the total number of down weeks = 484 weeks) -- is comparably high at $430/484 \\approx 0.888$, which might be quite bad depending on our sensitivity to losing money on an incorrectly predicted down week. Next is the positive predictive value, which is the number of true positives divided by the total number of predicted positives; in our case this is $557/987 \\approx 0.564$. This is better than chance, but as already noted we would have a comparable positive predictive value if we just predicted that every week would be an up week.

In this case, however, KNN with $k = 1$ and this subset of predictors performed slightly worse than the previous KNN classifier which used more predictors. Looking at the confusion matrix compared to $k = 3$ above, we see that all of the additional errors come from false positives.\n\nWhile we would need more precisely determine the metrics by which we would choose our preferred model and then perform further testing, such as cross validation, to more confidently choose a model, it seems as if there are two likely frontrunners to choose: logistic regression using all of the predictors aside from `CHAS`, and $k$-nearest neighbors using $k = 3$ the same set of predictors. The strength of the logistic regression model lies in relative simplicity and interpretability compared to KNN, as well as the fact that it had the second lowest overall test error out of the models we explored. The KNN classifier had slightly lower overall test error, but had a much better positive predictive value than logistic regression, at least when logistic regression used a prediction threshold of 0.5. One graphic we could use to better compare the performance of these two models would be to produce ROC curves for each model and compare the two area-under-curve values."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
