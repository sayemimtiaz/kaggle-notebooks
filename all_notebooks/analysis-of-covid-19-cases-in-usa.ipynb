Which counties seem to need less/more equipment based on the growth of the COVID-19 cases?\n* Make use of the geographic information. Can we see the pandemic moving to the neighbor counties/states? Do some neighbor counties/states have enough ressources (hospital beds, icu beds) to help out others? In other words: County XY has 0 hospital bed potential but the neighbours could help, county ZZ has a bigger potential but all the neighbours are at their limits. \n\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
