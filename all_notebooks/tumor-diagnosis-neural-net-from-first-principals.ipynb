The purpose of this Kernel is to develop a neural network that is capable of accurately predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant, given several measurements.\n\nThe dataset we will be using is the 'Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set'.  The dataset contains 569 patients with breast tumors.  Several measurements and a diagnosis of malignant and benign are available for each patient.  The measurements will be used as features to make our predictions on the diagnosis. \n\nThe neural network we will be developing will be derived from first principals (this means no Python packages such as scikit-learn will be used).\n\nLets begin by loading in our dataset and taking a look at it's structure."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset=pd.read_csv(\"../input/data.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3e1e136d1a33f55fb6ea0f266d5a56530aa03e62","scrolled":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset.head() #lets take a look at our data structure","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"f7a080b5f5dce976a704b6a627cace7ac83b00a6","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset.shape #Let's take a look at the dimensions of our data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4c98a48b27f6d9f8291be7040e7f68e5ceab981f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data has 569 rows, each representing a single patient, with 28 measurements each (note: there are 31 columns, but column 1 is an ID, column 2 is a diagnosis, and the 32nd is not a measurement)\n\nWe are now going to proceed by massaging the data.
