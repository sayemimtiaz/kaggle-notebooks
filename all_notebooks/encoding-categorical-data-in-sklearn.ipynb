I personally am particularly fond of `pandas.get_dummies`. This notebook explores `category_encoders`, a `scikit-contrib` module specifically dedicated to categorical encoders, which is the recommended way of applying more complicated categorical transforms on your data. It also comes with a host of features useful for advanced use cases. This is that notebook.\n\nNaturally one might ask: what is the point of categorical encoding?\n\nWhen storing data, categorical encoding can be useful as a technique for reducing dataset size on disk (via dictionary encoding). However, the primary usefulness of categorical encoding, and the reason that it is such a well-developed set of techniques within classical statistics, is that it can be used to improve the explanatory power of statistical models. This is done by transforming input data into an output representation that is more ammenable to modeling.\n\nEncoders have many of the same advantages and disadvantages as the techniques of [dimensionality reduction](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/dimensionality-reduction-and-pca-for-fashion-mnist/) overall. They make data easier to model, but also potentially lose information which can be taken advantage of by more complex models, like neural networks.

The rest of the transformers available in the library are more sophisticated, and may choose or choose not to merge particular categories together based on statistical tests that are applied to the dataset at fitting time.\n\nThe idea here is that by choosing a categorical encoding that is appropriate for the given dataset and what we want to do with it, we may have the benefits of categorization (e.g. dictionary-mapped encoding) whilst still preserving those properties of the dataset which are analytically valuable.\n\nA bit of a digression into statistics...\n\nA **contrast** is a linear combination of variables whose coefficients add up to zero. In other words, the quantity $\\sum_{i=1}^t a_i\\theta_i$ is a contrast iff $\\sum_{i=1}^t a_i = 0$. An example of a case in which this property holds is the difference of two weighted means. A constrast is furthermore **orthogonal** if it has the additional property that $\\sum_{i=1}^t a_i b_I = 0$.\n\nEach target or source category is known as a **level**.\n\nMany of the more advanced encoding schemes available in this library are what are known as contrast coders. They are formulated using a well-defined contrast matrix, and may or may not also be orthogonal.\n\n### Polynomial\n\n`PolynomialEncoder` takes categorical values are input:\n\n```\n(28,40] (40,52] (52,64] (64,76]\n     22      93      55      30\n```\n\nAnd outputs adjusted categorical values as output:\n\n```\n (28,40]  (40,52]  (52,64]  (64,76]\n42.77273 49.97849 56.56364 61.83333\n```\n\nThese values are chosen by fitting a polynomial regressor to the data, solving for the linear/quadratic/cubic coefficients that minimizes the adjusted $r^2$ (or some other test statistic) of the regression, and replacing the original categorical values with the new coefficient values.\n\nSome explanations of words:\n\n* **Polynomial regression** &mdash; an extension to linear regression which adds higher-degree terms (e.g. $x^2$, $x_3$, etc.) and their corresponding weights to the equation.\n* **Adjusted r^2** &mdash; $r^2$ is a goodness of fit test for linear models that measures the proportion of explained variance of a model. If we are trialing many different models, $r^2$ is misleading due to the [file drawer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias). Adjusted $r^2$ adds the adjustment to $r^2$ that makes it so that the $r^2$ of a new model is only an improvement to that of a previous model if the amount of explanatory power added exceeds the amount of explanatory power that could reasonably be added by random chance.\n\nFor algorithmic purposes, the coefficients chosen are subject to the constraint that they form an orthogonal contrast. In this example case this looks thusly:\n\n```\nLevel of readcat\tLinear (readcat.L)\tQuadratic (readcat.Q)\tCubic (readcat.C)\n1 (28,40]\t -.671\t.5\t-.224\n2 (40,52]\t -.224\t-.5\t.671\n3 (52,64]\t .224\t-.5\t-.671\n4 (64,76]\t .671\t.5\t.224\n```\n\nPolynomial regression is a good encoding scheme if you wish to apply a parametric model (particularly a regression model) to the data afterwards.

When `n = 1` this encoding is equivalent to one-hot encoding.\n\nAn important point about base-N is that when a column gets broken up into multiple columns, the information that was previously encoded in a single column is now \"broken\" up across two (or more). This is a form of induced non-linearity, and many models cannot take advantage of information split across a column like this.

Helmert coding constructs new values using the mean of the remaining values (there is also backwards Helmert coding, which does the same with the means of the *previous* values), whilst backwards difference does so with just one class at a time.\n\nBackwards difference coding is therefore an attractive option for the encoding of data that has pairwise relationships between adjacent values, because this pairwise information will be preserved in the choice of the output value."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import category_encoders as ce\nX_trans = ce.TargetEncoder().fit_transform(X, y)\nX_trans.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Target\n\nTarget encoding is a supervised categorical encoding technique (e.g. unlike certain other encoders, it uses information from your target variable `y`).\n\nIn the case that the target variable is categorical, features are replaced with a blend of posterior probability of the target given particular categorical value and the prior probability of the target over all the training data. The first element, **Posterior probability** is the probability of output observation $y$ given input data $X$, e.g. $p(y|X)$. The second element, prior probability of the target over all the training data, is the probability of $y$ occurring at all: $p(y)$.\n\nWhy do we blend these two variables? In small datasets, there are very few observations of $y|X$, so our estimate of $P(y|X)$ is unreliable. For example, consider the following dataset:\n\n```\nX   y\n20  True\n10  False\n10  False\n20  False\n```\n\nIn this dataset there are *no* observations of `y=True|X=10`, so $P(y|X)$ is completely undefined! It is easy to imagine another, slightly larger dataset where there are such observations, but very few of them, which makes our estimate of this quantity unreliable. In either case, a \"safer\" estimate for $P(y|X)$ is $P(y)$. If on the other hand we have a lot of observations like these, we have a lot of condifence that our estimate is reliable, so this isn't appropriate to do. Target encoding uses a weighted mean of these two values internally, emphasizing the second value when there is little support and the first when there is a lot of it.\n\nIf the target column is continuous (or more accurately, near-continuous) instead, posterior and base probability is substitued for expected value. The same principles and rationale applies.\n\nTarget encoding is generally considered to be a pretty good encoding scheme because the values it maps to are weighted averages of the target value. Mapping categorical values close to their expected value in this way is helpful in both probabilistic algorithms, like naive Bayes, as well as in regression. For this reason it is probably the second most common encoding scheme of the ones in this post, after one-hot.\n\nA good reference on target encoding is [this blog post](https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/target-encoding-done-the-right-way/)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import category_encoders as ce\nX_trans = ce.TargetEncoder().fit_transform(X, y)\nX_trans.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Leave-one-out\n\nLeave-one-out is a very slight modification on target encoding.

It evolved out of applications of logistic regression to credit default risk. Given that $E$ is a boolean event, e.g. something that happened, and $\\neg E$ is something that did not happen, the WOE formula is:\n\n$$\\text{WOE} = \\ln{\\frac{P(\\neg E)}{P(E)}}$$\n\nTaking the logorithm of a (positive) value has the effect of squashing that value down, e.g. from a potentially very large number to something more reasonable. It's easy to see how this value came to be useful in credit default settings, since in this setting the failure or defect rate is the default rate, which is a rare event, order of 1/1000 or rarer. It's also attractive if you're using logistic regression because look, a logarithm!\n\nThe weight of evidence encoder stars by dividing the categorical intervals into many different buckets. It then calculates the weight of evidence for each bucket. Buckets that are located next to one another contiguously and also have close weight of evidence values are then categorically combined, until only buckets that have relatively distinct weight of evidence values remain. Finally, the category level value is replaced with the weight of evidence value.\n\nWeight of evidence encoding is akin to choosing \"good splits\" in a histogram. It achieves the following two things:\n\n* It combines levels based on the observed hit rate for the target event.\n* It replaces level values with a logistic transform on the event incidence rate, which linearizes distributional differences in the data and can help parametric models like e.g. regression deal with the data.\n\nIt has the following limitation that it requires a binary target variable to work.\n\nA good reference on weight of evidence is [this blog post](https://www.listendata.com/2015/03/weight-of-evidence-woe-and-information.html)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import category_encoders as ce\nX_trans = ce.WOEEncoder().fit_transform(X, (y > 1).astype(int))\nX_trans.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### James-Stein\n\nThe James-Stein encoder is the target encoder with an enhanced formula for estimating $\\text{mean}(y_i)$, the canonical James-Stein equation.
