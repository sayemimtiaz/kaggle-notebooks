Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.\n\n**In the article published by Deron Lianga, Chia-Chi Lu, Chih-Fong Tsaic and Guan-An Shiha (Financial ratios and corporate governance indicators in bankruptcy prediction: A comprehensive study, 2016), I managed to find some additional information regarding how this dataset was collected.**\n\n1. \"The sample companies had to have at least three years of complete public information before the occurrence of the financial crisis.\" However, there was no information on the year the data were taken from (year of the bankruptcy (Y), Y-1, Y-2, or Y-3).\n\n2. The resultant sample includes: \n    * companies from the manufacturing industry composed of industrial and electronics companies (346 companies), \\n- the service industry composed of shipping, tourism, and retail companies (39 companies)\n    * and others (93 companies), but no financial companies.\n\n\n\n## Project Overview\n\n**Goals:** As a former Restructuring consultant, I thought it would be interesting:\n* to see whether we can accurately predict which company will face bankruptcy in the future with Machine Learning. \n* to leverage on this model to try to create some additional value such as developping a credit scoring tool (not performed in this notebook)\n\n**However, I will perform those tasks in depth through a future dataset that I will scrape myself on European or North American companies. Important information are missing in this dataset (such as the company's industry). Furthermore, I would like to scrape data from up to 1 year prior to the actual bankruptcy.**\n\n**Constraint:** Due to the dataset limitations, I decided to spend only 1 day working on this project.\nMy goals are:\n* To get used to working and publishing on Kaggle (as it is the first project that I will share on it),\n* To see how much value I could produce in a limited timeframe,\n* To increase the number of dataset and challenges I will be able to work with.\n\n\n**edit 16/06:**\n\nI actually created a repository to deploy this model on github thanks to flask/heroku: https://github.com/AymericPeltier/Bankruptcy_Prediction\n* Currently waiting from support on how to fix a dependancy issue with numpy (mlk not supported yet)\n* Furthermore, I updated 2/3 part of the codes to improve the f1_score, especially on the Linear_Regression (which is the model I deployed)\n=> Please refer to version 7 for what I achieved only in one day.\n\n**edit 19/06:**\n** Added classification report / confusion matrix for the NN\n\n# Index:\n\n- [Describe the data](#p2)\n- [Data pre-processing](#p3)\n- [Weak learners: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression](#p4)\n- [Shallow Neural Network (SNN) with Keras](#p5)\n- [Conclusion](#p6)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Let's load all the required libraries\n\n#General\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\n#Visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#Building the models\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, precision_recall_curve, f1_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report, roc_curve, auc\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn import tree\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score, GridSearchCV\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV, f_classif, VarianceThreshold, SelectKBest, f_regression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n\n#deep learning keras\nimport keras\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nfrom tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical\nfrom keras.layers import Dropout","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T23:09:47.128272Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T23:09:47.128631Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T23:09:47.138243Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T23:09:47.1286Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T23:09:47.137351Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" [Back to top](#Index:) \n<a id='p2'></a>\n### Describe the Data\n\n**Data type and quality:**\n- There are 96 columns (95 input features + 1 output feature) in the dataset, and 6819 rows (=companies)\n- 93 output features are numerical & 2 are categorical (one of which has only one value)\n- There is no missing data, no null values, no duplicated rows \n\n**Out of the 6819 companies in the dataset:**\n- 6599 (97%) did not go bankrupt\n- 220 (3%) went bankrupt\n\n\n**First impressions:**\n* The dataset is really clean, there is no need for extensive data cleaning.\n\n* Looking at the column names and taking in account that those are financial ratios, I can already guess that many features are highly correlated.\n\n* We can see a strong class imbalance.

As my goal is to make something easy to understand and simple to use, I'll restrain the features to those with the highest importance. -- at this stage, 9 features were selected.\n\n* Finally, after looking at their k score (SelectKbest) and their boxplot (data distribution), we will decide whether to use any more parameters. -- 6 features were kept.\n \n\n**At the end of our steps, we have 6 features remaining:**\n* ROA(C), \n* Net Value Per Share (B), \n* Debt ratio %, \n* Total Asset Turnover, \n* Cash/Total Assets, \n* Equity to Liability\n\nI decided to drop 'Accounts Receivable Turnover', 'Total income/Total expense', and 'Operating Profit Rate' as those parameters might lead to overfitting. If we obtained more datas, it would be interesting to check whether those parameters are actually useful or not. \n\n**Without going too much in depth due to the time constraint, they seem to efficiently capture the main aspects that lead a company to bankrupty:**\n* **ROA & Total Asset Turnover** provide information regarding how effective the investing strategy (into asset) is. It also gives an indice on profitability (as one is calculated based on net sales, and the other on net income)\n* **Net value and debt ratio** provide interesting relations between total assets and total debt (= financial risk)\n* **Cash/Total Assets** may indicates a degree of surety if not low (and too high)\n* **Equity to Liability** gives a picture of the leverage being used\n\nOverall, I think that we are missing very important information in this dataset:\n* the company industry: Financial ratios can strongly vary from an industry to another.\n* time series ratio. Most of this exercise value would be to predict risk of going bankrupt as soon as possible.\n\n**While I think we could actually achieve an even better selection taking more time and using domain knowledge, this set of parameter seems quite decent**\n\n**I won't be eliminating any outlier values for multiple reasons:**\n* the minority class sample is already quite small, I am unwilling to reduce it even further\n\n* We have no information regarding the companie's industry, financial ratio can vary strongly from one industry to another. Those outliers may actually be normal.\n\n* Bankrupt companies could present some highly skewed financial ratios.\n\nHowever, with more time for considerations and data exploration, I might do a different choice.\n\n**I did not perform any feature engineering as all the financial ratios are already quite precise and encompass many if not all the main financial aspect of a company.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Drop constant columns (if any)\nvar_thres = VarianceThreshold(threshold=0).fit(df)\nconstant_columns = [column for column in df.columns\n                    if column not in df.columns[var_thres.get_support()]]\nfor feature in constant_columns:\n     print(feature)\ndf.drop(constant_columns,axis=1, inplace=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.280114Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.280422Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.306033Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.28039Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.30506Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Normalize data for faster processing\ndef data_scaling(DataFrame):\n    scaler = StandardScaler()\n    DataFrame.iloc[:,1:] = scaler.fit_transform(DataFrame.iloc[:,1:])\n    return(DataFrame)\ndf_ml = data_scaling(df)\n\n#Split dataframe for feature selection\nX = df_ml.drop(columns=[\"Bankrupt?\"])\ny = df_ml[\"Bankrupt?\"]\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)\ndf_train =pd.concat([y_train, X_train], axis=1)\n\n\n#Sort columns from the less correlated to the most correlated\ndf_train_corr = df_train.corr()\ndf_train_corr = df_train_corr.reindex(df_train_corr[\"Bankrupt?\"].abs().sort_values(ascending=True).index).T\ncolumn_names = np.array(df_train_corr.columns)\ndf_train= df_train.reindex(columns=column_names)\n\n#Isolate the input features which have a high correlation between themselves\ndef correlation(dataset, threshold):\n    col_corr = set()  # Set of all the names of correlated columns\n    corr_matrix = dataset.corr()\n    for i in range(len(corr_matrix.columns)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if abs(corr_matrix.iloc[i, j]) > threshold: # we are interested in absolute coeff value\n                colname = corr_matrix.columns[i]  # getting the name of column\n                col_corr.add(colname)\n    return col_corr\ncorr_features = correlation(X_train, 0.65)\ndisplay(len(corr_features))\n\n#Now let's go ahead and drop them:\nX_train.drop(corr_features, axis=1, inplace=True)\nX_test.drop(corr_features, axis=1, inplace=True)\ndf_train.drop(corr_features,axis=1, inplace=True)\ndf_train.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.307706Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.307987Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.820587Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.307958Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.81948Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Feature selection for linear regression\n#Use rfecv to determine which features should remain in our model\nlgr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)\nrfecv = RFECV(estimator=lgr, step=5, cv=5, scoring='f1')\nrfecv = rfecv.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nselect_features_rfecv = pd.DataFrame({'Features': list(X_train.columns),\n                                  'Ranking_cv': rfecv.ranking_})\nselect_features_rfecv = select_features_rfecv.sort_values(by='Ranking_cv')\n\n#Let's also get their score on correlation\nselect_features = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=10).fit(X_train, y_train)\nselect_features_kbest = pd.DataFrame({'Features': list(X_train.columns),\n                                  'Scores': select_features.scores_})\nselect_features_kbest.sort_values(by='Scores', ascending = False)\n\n#Let's display the result\nselect_features_rfecv.merge(select_features_kbest, how='left', on='Features').head(20)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.82202Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.822453Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T23:03:35.200178Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T23:03:28.822413Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T23:03:35.19919Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Select the 9 most important features.

going bankrupt), let's use Shallow Neural Networks.\n\n**Model considerations:**\n* A Shallow Neural Network will be sufficient to deal with this problem\n* We will train the model 10 times with different split (as the data is small) to reduce the variance of the result\n* **We assign the following weight to the accuracy evaluation metric: 1 for correctly predicting non-bankruptcy and 4 for accurately predicting bankruptcy.** The reason behind is that False negatives are less problematic than False positives\n\n**Results:**\n* The f1 score of the SNN using our 6 selected features varies between 0.35 and 0.45 depending on the loops due to the small numbers of positive classes. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#We will
