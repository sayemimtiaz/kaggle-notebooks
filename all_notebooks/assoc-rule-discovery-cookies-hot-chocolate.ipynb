(Again if you would like to read in more detail I about the measure [Click Here](http://michael.hahsler.net/research/association_rules/measures.html#)[3]:\n\n**Support**: This determines the probability of an item-set by dividing the item-set occurrences over the total number of qualifying orders (orders with 2 or more transactions in them). Therefore, Support is the probability of an item-set occurring in transactions which have more than 2 items and it can be expressed as follows: Support(X and Y) = P( X ∩ Y )\n\n**Confidence**: Confidence goes a step further in and expresses the probability of having an item X given that Y was already purchased: P( Y | X ) and is calculated as follows: Conf( X -> Y) = supp(X - > Y)/supp(X) = P( Y | X ). Because P( Y | X ) does not imply P( X | Y ) then the lift metric needs to be introduced.\n\n**Lift**:  Lift allowes us to quantify the relationship between  P( Y | X ) and P( X | Y ) as follows: \n\nLift(X ⇒ Y ) = lift( Y ⇒ X ) = conf( X ⇒ Y )/supp( Y ) = conf( Y ⇒ X )/supp( X ) = P( X ∩ Y )/P( X )*P( Y ) \n\nIf Lift equal or greater than 1,  items are said to be compliments.[3]\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b466fed10664ef8bddb2028a469670e883357a36"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#### A.

However, note that these do not have a lift greater than 1 (except for coffee and toast). We can interpret this as follows:\n\nItemsets in the form {'Coffee', ' X ' }: Most of these items have a large amount of 'confidenceBtoA' or in other words, given that a customer has bought item X there is a high probability that a customer would buy coffee as well.  But this is not true the other way around. Buying coffee does not imply buying any other item as 'confidanceAtoB' is usually less than 0.1. \n\nPotential business solution:  There is a simple potential solution to this problem, simply at the point of sale, for anyone buying coffee and not buying anything else the bakery may want to offer an incentive or promotion to get a secondary item, preferably an item that already has relatively high 'confidanceAtoB' which indicates it is relatively more frequent than others, therefore, increasing the effectiveness of the promotion.\n\nItemsets with lift greater than 1: I personally find these very interesting. {Hot chocolate, Cookies}, {Sandwhich, Sandwhich}, {Hot Chocolate, Cake}, {Coffee, Toast}. Bundling these itemsets together in the form of a combo with a discount could be very useful for the business owner in my opinion. The only variation I would suggest to this strategy would be in the case of {Sandwhich, Sandwhich}. I would suggest pairing these two items together with beverages since it seems reasonable that the customers that buy this item set would also be a little thirsty. \n\nLet me know how you would implement these discoveries in the comment section.\n\nCamilo,\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9c90c13dce4c74fa6470688c4d48a912cdb19bc7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### References\n1.
