SafeML Idea\n\nSafeML idea has been proposed by (Aslansefat et al., 2020-b), and the goal was to somehow monitor the decisions of the classifiers when there is no available label.\n\nThe following figure demonstrates the flowchart of the SafeML idea. In this flowchart, there are two main sections including training phase and application phase.\n\n![Flowchart of SafeML (Aslansefat et al. 2020-b)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1832/1*iIpJOHOL1GWrp234jfYW0g.png)\n\nA) The training phase is an offline procedure in which a trusted or certified dataset will be used to train the intelligent algorithm that can be a machine learning or deep learning algorithm. Thus, using a trusted dataset the classifier will be trained and its performance will be measured with existing KPIs (e.g. ROC, Accuracy and Kappa). Meanwhile, the statistical parameters and distributions of each class will be estimated and stored to be used for comparison (e.g. Mean values, Variance Values, and the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (ECDFs)).\n\nB) The application phase is an online procedure in which real-time and unlabelled data is going to be feed to the system. For example, consider a security attack detector that has been trained to detect different security attacks and it should filter the attacker IPs. Therefore, in the application phase, the trained classifier should distinguish between the normal network traffic and the security attacks (classification task). One important and critical issue in the application phase is that the data does not have any label. So, it cannot be assured that the classifier can operate as accurate as of the training phase.\n\nIn the application phase, the buffered data will be separated based on classifier decision (that is not certified) and the statistical parameters of each class will be stored to be compared with the one in trained phased. Using the statistical distance measures that will be explained in the next section, the distance between features for each class in the trained phase and application phase will be compared. If the calculated distance and expected confidence (defined by an expert) difference was very low, the classifier results and its accuracy can be trusted (the system is acting autonomously), if the difference was low, the system can ask for more data and re-evaluation to make sure about the distance. In case of larger difference, the classifier results and accuracy are no longer valid, and the system should use an alternative approach or notify a human agent (In this example, the system will ask the responsible security agent to check the network traffic manually and make a decision).\n\n![Application of SafeML in security intrusion detection (e.g. datasets like CICIDS2017)](https://miro.medium.com/max/3642/1*qBLu6THDIyIJueq5BBKjng.png)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Code set-up: Imports, Packages, Environment variables, and Methods\n\nThe software versions used are:\n- The Python3 version used for this work is: Python 3.8.x\n- The scikit-learn version used is: scikit-learn 0.24.0\n- The seaborn version used is: 0.11.1\n- The Pandas version used is: 1.1.5 (although 1.2.0 was released recently, this should also work)\n\nBefore running, please run these commands via pip, in the terminal:\n- pip install pandas\n- pip install scikit-learn\n- pip install scikit-plot\n- pip install seaborn","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!git clone https://github.com/ISorokos/SafeML.git","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-23T10:45:17.904246Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-23T10:45:17.904629Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-23T10:45:21.266463Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-23T10:45:17.90455Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-23T10:45:21.265421Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\nsys.path.insert(1, './SafeML/Implementation_in_Python')\n\n# Importing local modules (statistical distance measures)\nfrom CVM_Distance import CVM_Dist as Cramer_Von_Mises_Dist\nfrom Anderson_Darling_Distance import Anderson_Darling_Dist\nfrom Kolmogorov_Smirnov_Distance import Kolmogorov_Smirnov_Dist\nfrom KuiperDistance import Kuiper_Dist\nfrom WassersteinDistance import Wasserstein_Dist\nfrom DTS_Distance import DTS_Dist # Combo of Anderson_Darling and CVM distance.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-23T10:45:21.268438Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-23T10:45:21.268704Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-23T10:45:21.278255Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-23T10:45:21.268677Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-23T10:45:21.277353Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport os, sys # For accessing Python Modules in the System Path (for accessing the Statistical Measures modules)\n# See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39311677\nnb_dir = os.path.split(os.getcwd())[0]\nif nb_dir not in sys.path:\n    sys.path.append(nb_dir)\n\nimport pandas as pd # For DataFrames, Series, and reading csv data in.\nimport seaborn as sns # Graphing, built ontop of MatPlot for ease-of-use and nicer diagrams.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # MatPlotLib for graphing data visually.

As per the reference, a low amount of nodes in the hidden layer can be ideal for a particular dataset. \n\nIf the Input size is around 20 PCA component features, with 1 output node (for the label), then between 10 and 15 nodes, with 1 hidden layer, would be following these heuristics. It can be incredibly hard to train larger Neural Network correctly, although it has been proved- theoretically- that a Neural Network can solve any task, as long as it's large enough and has the correct hyperparameter tuning.

Each comma added defines a new hidden layer.\n- **solver=** Adam solver works efficiently on large datasets, and is the \"stochastic gradient-based optimizer\" (SciKit docs).\n- **alpha=** is a penalty (regularization term) parameter.\n- **batch_size=** refers to the size of mini-batches for stochastic optimizers. If the solver is ‘lbfgs’, the classifier will not use minibatch. When set to “auto”, batch_size=min(200, n_samples).\n- **learning_rate=** is the \"learning rate schedule for weight updates\". Setting as 'constant' would keep the learning rate the same as the learning_rate_init value, even if two epochs were to not decrease by at least 'tol', which is not ideal. Thus, an 'adaptive' learning rate is used and this \"keeps the learning rate constant to ‘learning_rate_init’ as long as training loss keeps decreasing. Each time two consecutive epochs fail to decrease training loss by at least tol, or fail to increase validation score by at least tol if ‘early_stopping’ is on, the current learning rate is divided by 5\" (SciKit docs).\n- **learning_rate_init=** is just the initial learning rate value. It \"controls the step-size in updating the weights\".\n- **max_iter=** refers to the maximum number of iterations the MLP classifier will run through (each iteration/ epoch updates the node weights in accordance to other hyperparam info e.g. activation function, alpha, learning rate, etc... This is to try and increase the predictive capability of the MLP model).

Each index holds the specific statistical distance measure result, for the ith feature/ column.\n\nThe accuracy parameter holds some model accuracy that is to be passed in, so the result dictionary can be correctly returned in the perfect format (for the results table).\n\nThe X_train_L and X_test_L parameters hold the X_train and X_test data (a Pandas Dataframe i.e. 2D array, like a results table) for the dataset used in this Jupyter Notebook. The '**_L**' stands for 'label' so essentially this holds the train and test data, for a specific label/ class, based upon a query.\n\nThis method calculates all the Univariate results, and then calculates the mean/ average of the entire numpy array. This essentially retrieves the correct distance/ value for the ECDF-based statistical distance measure, as the mean is the correct value that should be returned. The mean represents the distance for the entire dataset, for that specific label/ class.\n\nFinally, it returns a Python dictionary which is used to efficiently create a Pandas Dataframe results table, for plotting of the results. It's just a more efficient way of appending dynamic results to a Pandas Dataframe object. See the links and documentation for the code, where this method is called from, for more info.\n\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/a/17496530.

Train of a model K times, and for each training iteration, K-Fold selects a different fold to use for testing; the remaining K - 1 folds become the training data. Typically, the optimal K value can be derived using the size of your dataset (num of rows). Ideally, each fold should be statistically representative of the population. Too small and it won't be useful. Too large, and you lose the positives from doing K-Fold.\n\nYou can use Stratified splitting with K-Fold, which ensures balance between some criteria (balances out the classes) e.g. equal portion of label classes in each fold.\n\nClass Imbalance is a significant issue in the ML/ Data Mining domain. It leads to incorrect results e.g. if one fold had all of 1 label (accidentally), then it would produce terrible predictive results as it wouldn't know what the other label class data point would look like. You can only work with the data you have, so this has to be dealt with.\n\nBenefits of K-Fold:\n- Use more of the data towards making a succesful model.\n- Obtain K models to evaluate, can improve the confidence that you have selected an appropriate model algorithm and cleaned/ prepared the data correctly, e.g. normal split with 1 model, one doesn't know if it's good or not- it could be heavily biased. Multiple models ensures less bias and increased variance.\n- Looking at the accuracy results from each of the k-Folds, you can identify data issues e.g. a certain fold performs really badly. Could this suggest that more cleaning is required? Maybe the data preparation was performed incorrectly?\n- If all folds return similar accuracies, one can be more confident that a deployed model will perform similarly to how one expects.\n\nIssues with K-Fold:\n- Creating K separate models requires more computation.\n- If you haven't got much data, you might not get many folds. Less folds means K-Fold loses its benefits.\n- If K is very large, each fold is small, and harder to ensure statistical distribution of.\n- Choosing the best of K models introduces bias. Real world data could perform better under a more general, lower performing model.\n\nCode reference: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Separating the label so that the answers aren't provided to the model, in training.\nX = df_final.drop(['label'], axis = 1)\ny = df_final['label']\ny","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.466765Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.467044Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.480833Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.46702Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.479628Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Initialising the StratifiedKFold model (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=num_of_splits_for_skf, shuffle=False)\nskf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.488866Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.489174Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.495994Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.489147Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.494921Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, splitting the data into train and test data, using the optimal splitting techniques of K-Fold and Stratified Splitting.\n\nCode reference: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for train_index, test_index in skf.split(X, y):\n    X_train, X_test = X.iloc[train_index], X.iloc[test_index]\n    y_train, y_test = y.iloc[train_index], y.iloc[test_index]\n\n    reshaped_y_train = np.asarray(y_train).reshape(-1, 1)\n    reshaped_y_test = np.asarray(y_test).reshape(-1, 1)\n    \nprint( 'X_train length: ', len(X_train) ) # To check if splits worked\nprint( 'y_train length: ', len(y_train) )\nprint( 'X_test length: ', len(X_test) )\nprint( 'y_test length: ', len(y_test) )","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.497733Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.498242Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.622522Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.498117Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.621384Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Modeling stage\nData is now fully transformed and ready for ML model training and predictions.\n\nSee CRISP-DM for more information.

In other words, similar things are assumed to be near to each other.\n\nThe most important factor in training a KNN model is the **number of neighbors hyperparameter**. You want to choose the K  value that reduces the number of errors, while maintaining the algorithm’s ability to accurately make predictions when it’s given data it hasn’t seen before. Here are some important considerations:\n\n- As you decrease the value of K to **1**, predictions become less stable e.g. imagine K=1 and you have a query point surrounded by several red 'dots' and one green 'dot', but the green dot is the single nearest neighbor. Reasonably, you would think the query point is most likely red, but because K=1, KNN incorrectly predicts that the query point is green.\n\n- Inversely, as you increase the value of K, predictions become more stable due to majority voting/ averaging, and thus, more likely to make more accurate predictions (up to a certain critical point- an **'overfitting' threshold**). Eventually, you would begin to witness an increasing number of errors. It is at this point you'd know that you have pushed the value of K too far.\n\n- In cases where you are taking a majority vote (e.g. picking the mode in a classification problem) amongst labels/ classes, you usually make K an odd number to have a tiebreaker.\n\nThe sklearn's default k value is 5 (also true for MATLAB's implementation).\n\nReferences: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html & https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"knn_model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, weights='uniform',\n                                    algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30,\n                                    p=2, metric='minkowski',\n                                    metric_params=None, n_jobs=None)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.623673Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.623955Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.628417Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.623928Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-23T10:45:47.627352Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Training the model and predicting test data results (confusion matrix)\nThe selected Machine Learning classifier/ model/ models can now be trained on training data (from the StratifiedKFold splitting).

See further below for full results.\n\n### What are the graphs/ plots showing, and why?\n\nThe graphs are plotting a model's varying accuracy against an ECDF-based statistical distance measure. Each row from the 'concatenated' Pandas Dataframe results table represents 1 permutation. \n\nEach permutation uses a different dataset split to train, test, and predict classes/ labels on. \n\nEach permutation can vary in accuracy, and also vary in its ECDF-based statistical distance, of a specific measure i.e. Anderson_Darling_dist.\n\nEssentially, these plots show that accuracy can be predicted based upon the ECDF-based statistical distance values calculated, based upon the data. This is a novel/ new idea in the field of AI/ ML safety, and is the basis of the SafeML idea.\n\nIn safety critical environments, predicting a model's accuracy based upon the incoming data- before the model can even use it to predict the next 'action' to take- is a great way to spot potential issues before they occur. Then, these potential errors- based upon a threshold- can be used to decide what steps to take next e.g.\n\n- In a human-in-the-loop system such as a self-driving car, if a large statistical distance value is detected (i.e. the input data is widely different to previous data fed to the model), then the AI system driving the car can pass control back to the driver before an accident occurs because the AI model driving the car could make a poor decision, since a large statistical distance value has been positively correlated to poorer model performance. This is the key idea of SafeML.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.relplot(data=concatenated, x='Accuracy', y='Anderson_Darling_dist',\n                hue='dataset', height=8.27, aspect=11.7/8.27)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-23T11:53:03.736523Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-23T11:53:03.736854Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-23T11:53:04.237146Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-23T11:53:03.736824Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-23T11:53:04.236061Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Seaborn pairplot\nA Seaborn **'pairplot'** can be used to plot 1 continuous feature against another, as a scatterplot in the example below.\n\nThe **data=x** parameter is where the Pandas Dataframe (results) is to be passed. Seaborn only allows 1 Pandas Dataframe to be passed in. This is where it can differ from Matplotlib. Seaborn can use this Dataframe **x**, and it can pull out column names, etc... automatically for you. Thus, instead of writing **'y_vars=concatenated['Accuracy']'**, which is what one would usually have to do, you can just write the column name, and Seaborn will find this in via the **data=x** provided.\n\nThe **y_vars=x[y]** parameter defines what column's data will be used on the y-axis. The column/ feature name, **y**, provided via **x[y]** is the column that will be used in the plot.\n\nThe **x_vars=x[x1, x2, x3, ...]** parameter defines what column or columns' data will be used on the x-axis. Since a pairplot is built specific to plot 'pairs' of columns against each other, an array can be passed into this. Each new array index will add an extra plot (horizontally) to the pair plot.\n\nThe **hue** parameter describes which feature/ column will be used to differentiate between data points plotted. It's like a **legend** or **c** parameter in Matplotlib. See here for in-depth explanation, comparing Matplotlib and Seaborn: https://stackoverflow.com/a/26139658\n\nThe **height** and **aspect** parameters are used to define the size of the plots.
