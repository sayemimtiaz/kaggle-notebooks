This is not ideal, and will be discussed below.\n- **New summary numbers:** three numbers are added to make it easier to evaluate results:  \n\n\n1. Total appearances: the number of times the domain appeared in SERPs (top 10)\n2. Coverage: total appearances divided by the total queries (shown as a percentage)\n3. Average position \n\nHere is how it looks like:\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LfD7M99G3IWoI7Ydqa0tfUTE9Vg476qY)\n\n## Some issues\nI'd like to start by mentioning some of the possible issues in the dataset: \n\n* Keywords: \"coffee\" doesn't say much about the intention of the user, and it is very generic. So is \"cafe\", although the intention is likely easier to figure out than \"coffee\".\n* Language: coffee is an English word, and cafe is used in many other languages. They requests were run in all available countries, many of which don't speak English, or the languages that have \"cafe\".  \n* Country weights: probably the most important issue. The visualization and counting assumes all countries are equal in value. They are not, whether in terms of population, GDP, coffe consumption etc. Ideally, you would have your own weights for countries, or whatever filtering parameters you are using and you can apply them for a better evaluation of the SERP ranks.\n\nWith the above issues in mind, let's take a look at how to produce the summary visualization shown above. \n\n## Basic Setup"},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"is_executing":false},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import advertools as adv # package used to import data from Google's API\nimport pandas as pd # pandas is pandas! \npd.options.display.max_columns = None\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot, init_notebook_mode\ninit_notebook_mode()\n\ncx = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CSE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID' # get it here https://cse.google.com/cse/\nkey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_DEVELOPER_KEY' # get it here https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/customsearch.googleapis.com\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You will also have to [get credentials for the project](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/credentials) and \nthen [enable billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects).\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The following code was used to generate the data.
