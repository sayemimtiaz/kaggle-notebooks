The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China as well as 192 other countries and regions, with more than 339,009 confirmed cases as of Mar 23, 2020.\n\nIn response to this ongoing public health emergency, researchers are releasing datasets available for academic purposes and public use. In this notebook, I will be exploring how to create a simple, yet highly visual map animation demonstrating how the virus spread across the world over the past few weeks using Python, Pandas, and Bokeh.\n\nThe full time-series dataset is continously being updated everyday, and as of Mar 23, 2020 contains 63 columns, the first four columns contain regional information, and the following columns represent each consecutive day - starting from Jan 22, 2020 - that contain the cumulative number of cases. \n\nHere is a short clip of what we will get:\n\n![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/MXpbnEhA9ML6ZOJwCm/source.gif)\n\nFull blog post here: https://horvay.dev/covid19/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Brief on Bokeh\n\nYou've probably used or at least heard of Matplotlib for working with visualization in Python, but in this post, I'll be using a library called Bokeh, so it's worth mentioning how the two differ.\n\n[Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) is used for creating highly interactive visualizations, while Matplotlib creates static graphics that are meant for simple and quick views into data.\n\nI went with this library since I want my visualization to be interactive - utilizing tool tips and such to give deeper insights."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, I'll explain the imports we are using:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import time\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, show\nfrom bokeh.io import output_notebook, push_notebook\nfrom bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, HoverTool\nfrom bokeh.tile_providers import get_provider\nfrom pyproj import Proj, transform","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* `time` - Is used for updating the map animation, we will update it every 50 milliseconds to show growth\n* `pandas` - Is used for creating and manipulating our dataset into dataframes\n* `numpy` - Is used in conjunction with pandas - in this case for manipulating arrays\n* `bokeh.plotting` - We import `figure` for the plot, and `show` for displaying said plot\n* `bokeh.io` - These imports are used for specifically to show plots inline and updating without starting a special Bokeh server\n* `bokeh.models` - These imports are used for creating tooltips and for sourcing data\n* `bokeh.tile_providers` - Tile providers are used to render base maps of Earth\n* `pyproj` - Is used to convert latitude/longitude to a more welcoming format for Bokeh's spatial libraries"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we can read in the dataset using pandas' `read_csv()` function and display the first five rows of data using the `head()` function on our created dataframe:[](http://)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read data\ndf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_confirmed.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As explained before, the first four columns contain regional information, and the following columns represent each consecutive day - starting from Jan 22, 2020 - that contain the cumulative number of cases. \n\nWe may want to engineer a new feature or column that just acts as a placeholder for the cumulative number of cases a.k.a the last day column. We can do this easily using `iloc[]` and which takes all rows as `:` and uses the `-1` indexing trick in Python, be assured we have the last day column.\n\nYou may also notice I went against the current column naming convention by using CamelCase. I am doing this because the other columns use `/` as a seperator, which makes it a bit more difficult to use tool tips when creating an interactive Bokeh plot.\n\nLet's rename the Provinence/State and Country/Region columns as well using pandas' `rename()` function:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get total confirm as of today\ndf['TotalConfirmed'] = df.iloc[:,-1]\n# Rename columns for easier access for tooltips\ndf.rename(columns={'Province/State':'ProvinceState', 'Country/Region':'CountryRegion'}, inplace=True) \ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Working with Spatial Data\n\nBokeh contains built-in tile providers in the `bokeh.tile_providers` module that we will use to represent the map of Earth.\n\nBokeh uses a standard web tile format called [Web Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection) projection for mapping.

For the title we want it to convey the date range of our times series. We also want to add tool tips that will display the province / state, country / region, and total confirmed cases as of the last day in the dataset (today). We will also default the plot size to a width of `800px` and height of `500px`.\n\nWe will source the CartoDB Tile Service `CARTODBPOSITRON`. Specifically, we will use `CARTODBPOSITRON_RETINA` as it creates high-resolution (HiDPI) tiles with a size of 512x512px (instead of default 256x256px).\n\n`output_notebook()` is one of the more important lines.

Using a while loop across the total number of days, we can then update our dataframe with the a new size for each region to represent the growth of cases (largest circles represent >= 5000 confirmed cases).\n\nUsing the `.stream()` function we can push the updated data to the plot's datasource and purge the old data after. When we call `push_notebook()` we update the Jupyter Notebook real-time! Last, we increment the day and set a sleep timer for 50 milliseconds to give it a smoother animation cycle."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"title = \"COVID-19 | Growth of confirmed cases {} - {}\".format(df.columns[4], df.columns[df.shape[1]-5])\nhover = HoverTool(tooltips=[(\"Province / State\", \"@ProvinceState\"),\n                            (\"Country / Region\", \"@CountryRegion\"),\n                            (\"Total confirmed cases as of today\", \"@TotalConfirmed\")])\np = figure(plot_width=800, plot_height=500, title=title, tools=[hover, 'pan', 'wheel_zoom','save', 'reset'])\ntile_provider = get_provider('CARTODBPOSITRON_RETINA')\np.add_tile(tile_provider)\np.circle(x='E', y='N', source=source, line_color='grey', fill_color='red', alpha=0.7, size='Size')\noutput_notebook()\n\nhandle = show(p, notebook_handle = True)\nday = 4 # Time series data starts at the 4th col\ntoday = df.shape[1]-5 # Time series data stops here since we added 4 new columns\nmax_size = 20.0 # Represents 5000+ cases\nwhile day < today:\n    df['Size'] = np.where(df.iloc[:,day]*.004<=max_size, df.iloc[:,day]*.004, max_size)\n    # Push new data\n    source.stream(df)\n    # Purge old data\n    source.data = df\n    push_notebook(handle=handle)\n    day += 1\n    time.sleep(.5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
