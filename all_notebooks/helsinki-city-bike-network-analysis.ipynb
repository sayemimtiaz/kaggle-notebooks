In this article, the city bike system will be analyzed as a complex network.\n\n# Introduction\nFor the past decades, transportation systems are commonly analyzed as networks. This abstraction allows to reduce the amount of information available and focus primarily on the internal structure of the underlying systems.\nThis idea is certainly not novel in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) or [urban planning](https://tigran-khachatryan.medium.com/architectural-context-in-the-age-of-big-data-camillo-sitte-a0d9ff377b5c). However, the recent developments in computational technologies and GIS frameworks enabled a new pragmatic application of graph theoretical ideas in the field of transport planning and geographic mobility.\n\n>Within the context of transportation, the term network  refers to the framework of routes within a system of locations, identified as nodes. A route is a single link between two nodes that are part of a larger network that can refer to tangible routes such as roads and rails, or less tangible routes such as air and sea corridors.\n\nTransportation networks normally denote either permanent physical tracks such as roads and railroads or a scheduled service. What makes bike-sharing and car-sharing services special is their ubiquity and possibility for self-organization. Unlike scheduled bus and train services, bike-sharing occurs on-demand and is more spatially flexible. It is crucial to highlight that edges of the city bike network are not predetermined, they are generated by the users. Thus, the structure of the network emerges from the flow of people through the city. Reoccurring trips made by the residents gradually formulate usage patterns and create the structure of the bike-sharing network. This information, in turn, can be used in a feedback loop for the evolution of the network. Rising or decreasing bike demand can provide insights into wider sociological, economical and geographic factors in certain areas.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import datetime\nimport calendar\nimport collections\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib.cm as cm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap, LinearSegmentedColormap\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nimport networkx as nx\nimport community as community_louvain\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\nimport folium\nfrom folium import plugins\n\n# Custom Colors\nMAGENTA = \"#6C3483\"\nGREEN = \"#239B56\"\nBLUE = \"#5DADE2\"","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# For Kaggle\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataframe = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/helsinki-city-bikes/database.csv\", low_memory=False)\ndataframe.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataframe[['departure','return']] =  dataframe[['departure','return']].apply(pd.to_datetime, format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f')\n\ndataframe = dataframe.rename(columns={'distance (m)': 'distance',\n                                     'duration (sec.)': 'duration',\n                                     'avg_speed (km/h)':'speed',\n                                      'Air temperature (degC)':'temperature',\n                                     })\ndataframe = dataframe[ \n                    (50 < dataframe['distance']) & (dataframe['distance'] < 10000) &\n                    (120 < dataframe['duration']) & (dataframe['duration'] <  18000) &\n                    (-20 < dataframe['temperature']) & (dataframe['temperature'] < 50)        \n                    ]","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating the Graph object","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def bikeNetwork(dataframe, year=2020):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function plots the City bike network with node sizes illustrating station popularity.\n    \"\"\"\n    #

This often results in some parts of the network being more information-rich than others. For example, in social networks, some individuals might have a large number of connections and can spread information faster than others. Hence, within the context of social network analysis, the nodes that represent them are considered more important(central). Within the context of transportation networks, an urban region where the influx of people is higher than in the other areas can be considered central. However, the centrality of a given network may change over time as a result of the growth and evolution of the underlying system. Thus, the definition of centrality is not absolute but rather depends on the specific context and the purpose of the abstraction. Taking this relativity into account, several centrality measures have been proposed that focus on different types of relationships between the nodes.\n\n# Degree Centrality\n\nDegree centrality is the most simple centrality measure to understand and compute. \"Degree\" of a node refers to the number of nodes that a given node is connected to. Within the context of city bikes, this refers to the number of bike stations that users have travelled to from the target station.

It has been suggested that these metrics applied in an urban context often lead to misleading results since they ignore a multitude of urban qualities that might contribute to the importance of the node within the city. Some methods to overcome this issue propose adding an increasing amount of information to the graphs. This is a questionable approach since adding an increasing amount of information will inevitably introduce new arbitrary patterns within the data. Thus, these approaches often blur the clarity achieved by the act of abstraction creating a clear anti-pattern.\n\n While the limitation of Eigenvector centrality to capture urban qualities might be a problem in collective transportation systems where the routes of the services are predetermined, this is certainly not the case with individual transportation. As mentioned before, the structure of individual transportation networks is generated by the users therefore it already has the information about the urban qualities embedded in it. The fact that users have a choice and choose to take one path instead of the other creates a trivial voting mechanism that rates different areas of the city. Thus, in this kind of networks, the study of the structure of the network is also a study of user behaviour and their preferable urban qualities. Additionally, Eigenvector centrality in individual transportation networks allows highlighting not only important singular nodes but also geographically important areas within the city. This is possible because it acknowledges not only the importance of individual station but also the importance of stations adjacent to them. Eigenvector centrality illustrates that importance in the city bike stations(nodes) is derived no so much from their inherent attributes(location, station size) but rather from their relationships with other nodes within the network. Central stations together with nodes adjacent to them form small enclaves of activity.
