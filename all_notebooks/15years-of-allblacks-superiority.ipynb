they were not unbeatable.  \nIf 6 teams have been able to beat New Zealand, two stand out :\n* the __Lions__ with the lowest defeat rate against the All Blacks (66.7%).\n* __South Africa__ that has been able to win 10 times (28.6% of their games) and stand strong at home.\n\nNonetheless we found that obviously if you want to beat them, you'd better play them at home.\nIt will increase your
