For classification, the scores are shown follow:\n1. Accuracy scores is the most important performance measurement since it is the amount of correct classification.\n\nVarying in accuracy scores, there are train accuracy scores and test accuracy scores. Train accuracy is the accuracy of the model on train examples it was used. Test accuracy is the accuracy of the model on train examples it hasn't seen (Test set).\n2.  Precision scores determine the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.\n3. Recall, commonly known as sensitivity or true positive rates, is the ratio of how often the value is correct when the actual value is positive.\n4. F-1 score is the average between Precision and Recall. calculated with  2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)\n5. Support is the number of samples of the true response that lie in that class.\n\nFor my case, im going to focus on recall score to get insights of the true positive rates in order to choose the best machine learning algorithm. However, observing one score is not enough to determine the best algorithm used.
