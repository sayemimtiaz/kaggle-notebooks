Please show your support by upvoting and comment your suggestion and feel free to correct me whereever Im wrong.***\n\n## Predicting New Sales using Linear Regression Model\n\nI wrote this notebook to help the **#machineLearning** and **#linearregresion** novice to understand better how these things work. In this Notebook one can learn or get an overview of **how to perform EDA on both numerical and categorical feature, handling missing-valuesbasic and build a Linear regression model** from **#statsmodels** and aslo to check the model performance considering the **#mean_absolute_error** and **#MAPE scores**. \n\nI encourage you to fork this kernel, play with the code and can ask for any kind of help to understand these in comments .
