Chess games of this period emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.\n\nPeople did not care about their pieces, pawn, sometimes even sacrificing their Queens, just to attack the enemy King, Long-term strategic planning, that was for the coward's, the goal of the game for everyone was to checkmate the other enemy.\n\nKey Players - Alexander McDonnell, Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, Daniel Harrwitz, Henry Bird, Louis Paulses.\nAnd the most important Paul Morpy, who was the best player at his time.\n\nYou might have not heard of them but you might still come across their name's via Opening's like Bird's Defence, Staunton Gambit etc.\n\n## Classical Era\n\n![](https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/viswanathan-anand-fb1.jpg)\n\nMorphy’s eventual successor, Wilhelm Steinitz, reigned as world champion until 1894. Steinitz managed to retain his superiority for so long because he developed new principles of the middlegame, particularly in closed or semiclosed positions, that only his successor, Emanuel Lasker, and Lasker’s contemporaries fully appreciated. <br>\n___Steinitz said his “modern school” was guided by two premises:___\n1. that the natural outcome of a game is a draw because of the inherent balance between the forces of White and Black \n2. that checkmate is the ultimate but not the first objective of the game.\n\nThe games had begun to move to the Hyper Mordern Era, and Steinitz was the one who started it, People had started realizing that the way to justify a decisive attack in the post-Morphy era was to accumulate small, often subtle, advantages — for example, having two bishops when one’s opponent has two knights, having an entrenched knight at a fortified outpost, or having greater maneuvering space.\n\nPeople had started to develop Positional Play, they had started to try to accumulate slow advantages, than going straight for the king with badly coordinated pieces\n\n* This is as far as we go, since after 1915, Hypermordern Era starts, but the games we have access to is only till 1914*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# No. of
