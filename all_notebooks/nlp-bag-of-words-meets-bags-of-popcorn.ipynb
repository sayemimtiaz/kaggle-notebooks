Uma abordagem comum é a técnica Bag of Words, consiste no modelo usar o vocubulario de todos o documentos analisados (neste caso avaliações de filmes), literalmente as informações viram um \"Saco de palavras\", cada documento é levado em conta quais palavras do voculabulario foram utilizadas na formação deste mesmo documento. Segue exemplo em duas sentenças:\n\nFrase 1: \"The cat sat on the hat\"\n\nFrase 2: \"The dog ate the cat and the hat\"\n\nPara as duas sentenças, o vocabulo segue:\n\n{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n\nPara conseguir o \"saco de palavras\", contamos o numero de vezes que a palavra ocorre em cada Frase. Na sentença 1, \"the\" aparece duas vezes, também as palavras \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", e \"hat\" cada aparece uma vez, então o novo registro da senteça 1 numéricamente fica:\n\n{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n\nFrase 1: { 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 }\n\nFrase 2: { 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n\nIn the IMDB data, we have a very large number of reviews, which will give us a large vocabulary.
