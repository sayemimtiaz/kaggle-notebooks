So, I thought it could help the Kaggle community to develop a kernel that contained this metric, for anyone who needed to use it. \nHowever, to help me, I ended up creating a simple script (also available here for the community) called **easymetrics**. It contains not only the Diebold-Mariano test, but also easier ways (for me at least) to achieve the results of training, testing and validating 5 metrics: R2, Explained Variance Score, RMSE, RMSLE and MAE.\n\nIn this kernel, **XGboost** and **LightGBM** frameworks are hyperparametrized and compared using Diebold-Mariano Test. The dataset used is a energy generation compilation of several countries, measured in THh between 2000 and 2019. Its contents were extracted from World in Data.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.
