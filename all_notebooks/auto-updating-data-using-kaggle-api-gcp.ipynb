Since there are a lot of files, its better to store them all into one tar.gz file and upload that. A tar.gz file often called a tarball, is a collection of files wrapped up in one single file for easy storage. Rather than keep track of a whole folder of files, you only need to keep track of one. Tar files are often compressed after being created, giving it the .tar.gz file extension.\n\n    1) Create the tar file by running  \" tar -zcvf all_data.tar.gz temp \" \n     -- tar -zcvf is the command, all_data_tar.gz is the compressed file name and temp is the directory where all my raw files are stored in my instance\n    \n    2) Now,transfer to the bucket with \" gsutil cp all_data.tar.gz gs://first_project_data_zomato/ \" \n        - replace first_project_data_zomato with the name of your bucket\n        \nRemember we saw the methods to create a storage bucket and gsutil being one of the ways. We just put that to use. \n\nIt is a useful tool for accessing GCP buckets and much more using the cloud SDK from the command line. You can read more [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) and [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/)\n\nNow, the data is available both on the instance & in the bucket and we can go ahead and create the kaggle dataset right away. But the data in the bucket is not publicly available by default, which it needs to be if we want to use the Kaggle platform to create it. gsutil comes into play here again, \n\nChange the permission by running \n\n    gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://first_project_data_zomato/all_data.tar.gz --> (change the bucket name and tar filename accordingly).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='push'></a>\n\n# Pushing to Kaggle","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, we have an option of either letting kaggle platform update the dataset using the settings available in Kaggle or from the instance storage using the API. We will look at both the options and you may choose whichever best suits you. \n\n\n**OPTION 1 -  This option is preferred if your data is large and if you are planning on deactivating your instance most of the time. For this, you would ideally be running your script locally and for that you might need [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/)**\n\n 1) From the GCP console, go to STORAGE and then click on your bucket. You should see your newly uploaded tar.gz file and the 'Public access' column should be set to 'Public'. Next to the word 'Public', you should see a link symbol.
