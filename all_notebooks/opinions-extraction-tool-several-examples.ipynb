In fact, it can be very difficult to quickly get reliable information: many different points of view are represented in the medias as well as in the scientific litterature.\n\nInstead of simply returning the most closest sentences to the query, we chose to **extract the diferent opinions**, which can be shared by the different groups of people working on a subject.\n\nWe wanted to provide a tool easily reusable, reproducible and easy to understand as a Python library installable from Github.\n\n![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/master/images/kaggle_covid.png)\n\n## How it works \n\n### Database creation\n\nAll titles, abstracts and body texts of the dataset are [inserted into an SQLite DB](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/database_utilities.py#L186) (only english articles for the moment).\n\nThey are preprocessed by using the [method we developed](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/text_preprocessing.py#L21). It will lower and stem the text, remove stopwords, remove numeric values, split texts into sentences and sentences into words.\n\nA [word2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) embedding and a [TF-IDF](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) models have been trained on this pre-processed corpus. Briefly, these models allow to get a fixed-length vector of numeric values to represent each word of the corpus (word2vec) and to weight each word regarding it's frequency among all the corpus and in each document (TF-IDF). The result is a parquet table, [stored on Github](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/resources/global_df_w2v_tfidf.parquet), containing for each word a float vector and a TF-IDF score.\n\n![Table header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/master/images/header_w2v_tfidf.jpg \"Table header\")\n\nThis embedding can be re-generated in more or less 30 minutes on a 8 vCPU machine by using [this script](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/scripts/train_w2v.py).\n\nEach sentence from the corpus is pre-processed and [vectorized](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/embedding.py#L65). To do so, each pre-processed word from a sentence is represented by its vector and weithed by the TF-IDF score. Then, all vectors from the different words composing the sentence are averaged ([Mean of Word Embeddings](https://books.google.fr/books?id=tBxrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=mean+of+word+embedding+MOWE&source=bl&ots=7laX_HWKS0&sig=ACfU3U2DvGwGI6Bs4HTkX0_oP7Nf3UTP2A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiXguOJ9tjoAhX3D2MBHS6mAzoQ6AEwCnoECA0QKA#v=onepage&q=mean%20of%20word%20embedding%20MOWE&f=false)). All these pre-processed sentences are [stored in base](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/text_preprocessing.py#L151).\n\n### Query matching\n\nThe query is first [vectorised](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/query_matching.py#L57) by using the same strategy and tool as explained above. The cosine similarity of this sentence [versus all stored sentences](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/query_matching.py#L127) vectors is then computed. Briefly, it allows to check how each sentence of the dataset is close from the query. Only the top-k sentences are returned (filtered by minimal distance).\n\nAll these top-k closest sentences are then clusterised by a Kmean algorithm. These clusters will represent the different *opinions* found about the query.\n\nAll the closest sentence from each centroid is highlited (*ie*, the sentence reflecting the most the opinion on this subject) and an HTML (or markdown) report about closest sentences and most relevant papers is written.\n\n## What's cool\n\n- Code is documented, cleaned, PEP8 complient and installable as a Python library. It is hosted on a public Github repository, allowing people to collaborate to the devlopment.\n- The trained embedding is not generic. Even if pre-trained models found on the Internet work well, the context of covid-19 and the kind of sentences to be processed make a locally trained embedding better.\n- Code is optimisez for RAM and rapid processing. Only the resulting DB built on all articles weights gigabytes.\n- The solution is highly portable (even on mobile with less sentences for example) due to the usage of SQLite.\n- Scripts to reproduce experiments (create the DB, perform a query, retrain W2V, generate pagerank score or perform multi queries) are published on the Github and usable out-of-the-box.\n\n## What's not\n\n- The database containing all sentences weights more than 20Go. It is thus unusable on Kaggle. To overcome this issue, we first randomly selected 10 sentences from the body of all articles. Then, we add two parameters instead *only_newest* and *only_covid* instead which select respectively only articles published since 2019 or with an abstract containing a synonym of \"covid\".\n- Clusters quelity is highly dependent of the number of cluster. Once automatically estimated, it sometimes \"split an opinion\" into two distinct clusters which should have been merged.\n- The highly-specific embedding also has cons. Many words from queries have not been found enough in the corpus to be kept by the embedding model. Maybe the solution is to use a generic pre-trained embedding and to update it on our data.\n\n## What's next\n\nVersion 2.0 of this work will be released before the April, 15th. To come:\n\n- ~~Auto-estimate K for the number of opinions.~~\n- ~~Maybe some interactive figures.~~\n- ~~Ranking best papers from opinions clusters regarding the authors and their background.~~\n- ~~Uploading the citation network as a directed graphe in Kaggle datasets.~~\n\n**And during the round #2, we would to develop:**\n\n- Create an interactive tool, hosted online for instant query.\n- Auto-test the code on Github with unitary tests on the methods to ensure quelity of the code.\n- A multi-lingual search (maybe with trained embedding on different languages instead of just translating the query).\n- Use a larger pre-trained embedding (on the same corpus but maybe with some data augmentation from PubMed on the given subjects).\n- Auto update of the newly published scientific litterature with a link to the Pubmed API.\n\n## List of tricks\n\n- Only newest or covid-related articles are used in Kaggle, the resulting database is way too large.\n- Two regexs are applied on the texts: one transforming every possible way of writing \"Coronavirus-2019\" into \"COVID-19\", the other one transforming \"Corona Virus\" into \"Coronavirus\".\n- We filter non-english articles for the moment, so they are not in the dabatase.\n\n## Usage\n\nQueries from the different tasks have been reformulated (or raw task if not) and [stored in Github](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/resources/queries.json). All of them have been sent to the pipeline and the result are stored in markdown format [here](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/resources/executed_queries.md) (queries have been matched versus the corpus released on April 3th which was not updated since on our devlopment workstations).\n\nBut we think a manual analyse of the refults reflects the most how this tool can be used.\n\nFor this notebook, we will focus on several questions and try to answer them by using our tool."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setup\n\nThe library can be easily [installed from github](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/setup.py) by using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install custom library from Github\n!pip install -q --no-warn-conflicts git+https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle\n\nfrom c19 import parameters, database_utilities, text_preprocessing, embedding, query_matching, clusterise_sentences, plot_clusters, display_output\n\n# Ugly dependencies warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then, the parameters are loaded ([full explaination of the parameters](https://github.com/MrMimic/covid-19-kaggle/blob/master/src/main/python/c19/parameters.py)). \n\n*Parameters* class returns default configuration which can be customised as follow.\n\nThe *first_launch* parameter allows to create the database instead of just loading it."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\n\nparams = parameters.Parameters(\n    first_launch=True,\n    database=parameters.Database(\n        local_path=\"local_database.sqlite\",\n        kaggle_data_path=os.path.join(os.sep, \"kaggle\", \"input\", \"CORD-19-research-challenge\"),\n        only_newest=True,\n        only_covid=True\n    ),\n    preprocessing=parameters.PreProcessing(\n        max_body_sentences=0,\n        stem_words=False\n    ),\n    query=parameters.Query(\n        cosine_similarity_threshold=0.8,\n        minimum_sentences_kept=500,\n        number_of_clusters=\"auto\",\n        k_min=3,\n        k_max=10,\n        min_feature_per_cluster=100\n    )\n)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We construct the database by loading all titles, abstracts and bodies (please remember that articles are filtered on Kaggle and they are not all loaded into the database).\n\nWe also build up a knowledge graph using each article and it's citations, to build up a citation network of the dataset.
