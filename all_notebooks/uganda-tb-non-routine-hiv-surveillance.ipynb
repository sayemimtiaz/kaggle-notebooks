Wakiso had 5,108 people screened with 301 testing positive to TB, representing 6 per cent while Mukono had 958 people tested with 62 (6 per cent) confirmed TB positive. All the above were done through TB contact investigations screening.\n\nThe total population tested during the survey was 59,781 and 1,675 tested positive to tuberculosis.\n\nThe areas that presented the biggest TB infection rates are male congregated areas with 8.9 percent testing positive, followed by barracks at 5.6 per cent.The survey cited hotspots for TB infections as taxi parks, slums, worship places, nightspots, workplaces and a number of other facilities that host large populations.\n\n“Imagine a scenario where each of those 22 actually got into a different taxi and each of them coughed. You are potentially going to have another twenty two cases who are going home (infected). Because again four out of 10 don’t know that they have TB, they will again cough in their homes and you have that multiplier effect,”  THE SAME OCCURS WITH COVID-19.\n\nTB in Uganda Project: while the disease is curable, many people are reluctant to seek treatment and where they do, many don’t complete the dosage. Uganda is one of the few countries in the world with high TB disease burden and more must be done to combat the prevalence.\n\n“In the last few years, the WHO reported that tuberculosis infection rates rival HIV-AIDS infections as a leading cause of deaths.\n\nSeveral people with TB do not know that they have the disease. Uganda is one of the 30 high TB-HIV burden countries in the world with TB prevalence which is 1.5 times higher than the previously estimated by WHO.\n\nTB is posing a huge problem because patients do not adhere to the treatment schedule.\n\n“About 10 percent of patients with drug sensitive TB die every year and about 15 percent abandon treatment and remain in the community. About 80,000 people in Uganda develop tuberculosis every year but about 4 percent remain undetected.\n\nThey stay in the community and continue to spread the disease. Every untreated TB patient can spread disease to about 15 others every year. The good news is that TB is curable and treatment is freely available at all TB treatment facilities in the country. To identify and minimize TB infection among all people, there is an urgent need for individual and collective responsibility and the time is now,” \n\nCommunity sensitization must be done and more people be advised to seek medical attention early.\nhttp://www.tbonline.info/posts/2019/3/20/tb-infections-hit-90000-year-uganda-overtake-hiv-r/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://ntrl.or.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stoptb-tbandcovid19-768x384.jpg)https://ntrl.or.ug/category/news/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.heps.or.ug/sites/default/files/images/2018/10/img-20160323-wa0015_0.jpg)https://www.heps.or.ug/projects/defeat-tb","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Modelling the impact of stunting on child survival in a rural Ugandan setting\n\nAuthors: John Bukusuba , Archileo N Kaaya , Abel Atukwase - PMID: 32153877 PMCID: PMC7050845 DOI: 10.1186/s40795-018-0220-4\n\nUganda ranks among the top 10 countries in the world for newborn and child mortality rates and among the top 34 for burden of stunting. That study was conducted to model the impact of stunting on child mortality in the southwest region of Uganda where the prevalence of stunting and child mortality are of great public health concern.\n\nThey gathered relevant information on Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) and coverage of AnteNatal Care (ANC) and vaccination programs. The survey of stunting, vaccination and ANC services covered 221 children aged 6-59 months while the assessment of IYCF practices covered 83 children aged 0-23. The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) was used to estimate the impact of stunting on child mortality and cases of stunting averted. Only 28% were fully vaccinated. The high impact LiST model estimated that 1297 children under 5 years would be saved and 24,850 cases of stunting averted in the study district.\n\nThe study concludes that IYCF (Infant and Young Child Feeding) practices and coverage of expanded programme on immunization (EPI) and ANC (Antenatal Care) in the study population are sub-optimal thus the high prevalence of stunting and child mortality in the region. LiST (Lives Saved Tool) demonstrated that prevention of stunting would reduce child mortality in rural Uganda. Therefore, increased investment in cost-effective child survival interventions targeting rural areas of Uganda would have a significant impact on stunting and child mortality. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32153877/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadssurveillancecsv/surveillance.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'surveillance.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://scontent.fsdu5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p960x960/58049125_287077085501333_7247929505828831232_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=MQ0WDmAdCJAAX-m_LrV&_nc_ht=scontent.fsdu5-1.fna&_nc_tp=6&oh=ec700760354e700b7d63442a68a53cf2&oe=5F693C53)https://www.facebook.com/zerotbuganda","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Columns Names\n\n\"tbhiv_sentin_cil\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Lower limit (95% confidence interval) of prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using sentinel sites\"\n\n\"tbhiv_sentin_ciu\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Upper limit (95% confidence interval) of prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using sentinel sites\"\n\n\"tbhiv_sentin_prev\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using sentinel sites\"\n\n\"tbhiv_sentin_yr\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Year in which prevalence of HIV in TB patients was estimated using sentinel sites\"\n\n\"tbhiv_surv_cil\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Lower limit (95% confidence interval) of prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using nationwide representative surveys\"\n\n\"tbhiv_surv_ciu\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Upper limit (95% confidence interval) of prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using nationwide representative surveys\"\n\n\"tbhiv_surv_prev\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using nationwide representative\nsurveys\"\n\n\"tbhiv_surv_yr\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Year in which prevalence of HIV in TB patients was estimated using nationwide representative surveys\"\nhttps://gitlab.procc.fiocruz.br/oswaldo/DS_2017/blob/4e8f97ebbd15bdba60c2e3c0d91298a24801a2c5/exemplos/TB_data_dictionary_2017-10-23.csv","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#HIV Epidemiology in Uganda\n\nHIV Epidemiology in Uganda: survey based on age, gender, number of sexual partners and frequency of testing\n\nAuthors: Jay Vithalani and Marta Herreros-Villanueva Afr Health Sci. 2018 Sep; 18(3): 523–530. doi: 10.4314/ahs.v18i3.8\n\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is without a doubt one of the most serious conditions affecting the human population in the 21st century). According to the recent late 2016 statistics from World Health Organization (WHO), 36.7 million people worldwide are currently living with HIV1,2. Of all the regions, one of the most heavily affected is sub-Saharan Africa where approximately 1 in every 25 adults (>18 years old) is currently living with HIV, accounting for roughly two thirds of all individuals currently living with HIV worldwide.\n\nIt is well known that HIV infection leads to dysfunction of both the adaptive and innate immune systems, affecting mainly the cell-mediated immunity because of the depletion of CD4+ T cells, due to several mechanisms, including direct cytopathic effects of the virus and indirect effects. Additionally, it leads to functional defects in the immune system that increase the immune deficiency caused by CD4+T depletion.\n\nUganda has one of the highest Prevalence rates in the world. Late 2000s statistics showed a drastically decreased prevalence rate hovering around 6.5%2. However, reports in 2012 suggested that Uganda was one of only two African countries where rates of new HIV infections were back on the rise. This resulted in an increased prevalence rate of up to 7.3%14. Health experts believe that the government's complacency and stagnant actions may be to blame for this rise. Latest reports from 2016 display that the prevalence rate has now decreased to 6.5%2. Uganda's strong approach which differed from world approach of mainly barrier protection may have led to this decrease.\n\nUganda is on the right path to raise awareness about frequent testing for HIV with the help of roadside billboards and television advertisements. Along with urging the public to get tested for HIV status, it also provides education about HIV. Continued efforts such as this combined with the help of world organizations and assistance from the Government of Uganda, the country can be on the path to drastically decrease the rate of new HIV infections in the future.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6307011/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes by PAB97 https://www.kaggle.com/rftexas/osic-eda-leak-free-kfold-cv-lgb-baseline","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = sns.distplot(df['tbhiv_surv_prev'],color=\"r\", bins=100)\nax.set_title('Distribution of Prevalence of HIV in TB patients')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = sns.distplot(df['tbhiv_surv_cil'], bins=100)\nax.set_title('Distribution of Prevalence of HIV in TB patients using Nationwide Representative Surveys')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Factors influencing childhood immunization in Uganda, Author Edward Bbaale\n\nPMID: 23617212 PMCID: PMC3702366 DOI: 10.3329/jhpn.v31i1.14756 - J Health Popul Nutr . 2013 Mar;31(1):118-29.\n\nThat paper investigates the factors associated with childhood immunization in Uganda. They used nationally-representative data from Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) of 2006. Both bivariate and multivariate approaches were employed in the analysis. The bivariate approach involved generating average percentages of children who were immunized, with analysis of pertinent background characteristics.\n\nThe multivariate approach involved employing maximum likelihood probit technique and generating marginal effects to ascertain the probability of being immunized, given the same background characteristics. It revealed that slightly over 50% of children in Uganda were fully immunized. Additionally, 89%, 24%, 52%, and 64% received BCG, DPT, polio and measles vaccines respectively.\n\nFactors which have a significant association with childhood immunization are: maternal education (especially at post-secondary level), exposure to media, maternal healthcare utilization, maternal age, occupation type, immunization plan, and regional and local peculiarities. Children whose mothers had post-secondary education were twice as likely to be fully immunized compared to their counterparts whose mothers had only primary education (p < 0.01). Thus, gender parity in education enhancement efforts is crucial. There is also a need to increase media penetration, maternal healthcare utilization, and to ensure parity across localities and regions.
