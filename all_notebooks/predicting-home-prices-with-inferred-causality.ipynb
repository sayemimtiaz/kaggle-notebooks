By enlarge, data science seems preoccupied with boosting prediction scores by any means necessary, not with determining true causal effects between variables. One problem with this approach is that models become like black boxes, providing accurate predictions without providing true insight or understanding of the system of interest. Another problem is that models built on correlation alone cannot be used to accurately predict the result of an intervention into a system. For instance, a model trained to predict sales prices of houses might not be able to determine the effect of an intervention on sales price, e.g. remodeling the kitchen. Only by modeling causal relationships between variables and conditioning on variables according to the backdoor criterion can the effect of an intervention into a system accurately be  modeled. \n\nTo this end, the basic objective of this notebook is to use the Inferred Causality (IC) algorithm as a feature selection technique in the data-science pipeline. Using IC we will find a set of variables determined to directly affect sales prices. Then we will fit and validate a simple linear model built using these causal features. Hopefully, this technique will yield a model that both provides accurate predictions and gives insight into the factors which truly drive sale prices within the dataset. \n\nIn a nutshell, IC uses conditional probability tests between variables to partially reconstruct the causal graph of a system. There’s a lot to unpack here which is outside the scope of this notebook, however, if you are interested I would highly recommend reading this ongoing series of [blog posts](https://medium.com/causal-data-science/causal-data-science-721ed63a4027) on the Pearlian Causality Framework. \n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Data <a id = 'data'></a>\n\nThe Ames Housing dataset was derived from a data dump obtained directly from the Ame's City Assessor's Office.

The IC object takes  3 parameters: the conditional independence test to use (independence_test), the confidence interval to use (alpha), and the maximum number of variables used to attempt to block two variables from each other (k). The IC algorithm is run using the search method of the IC object, which takes two parameters data and variable_types. The data parameter is just your data. The variable_type is a dictionary with keys corresponding to column names and values corresponding to whether the variable is continuous 'c' or discrete 'd'. The search method returns a networkx graph where nodes correspond to variables and edges between variables representing possible causal links.\n\nThe way the algorithm works is it starts with a networkx graph with nodes representing variables where all nodes are initially connected. Then for each variable pair, the algorithm tries to find a set of other variables that can block the dependence between the pair of variables. The dependence between two variables is considered blocked if the test is less than (1- alpha)X100 percent sure that a dependency exists. By setting alpha to .1 we are saying that we want to be at least 90% sure of dependency to continue with the algorithm. If the algorithm finds a set of variables that can block the dependency of the variables pair it cuts the edge between the pair. If it can't find a blocking set it continues with another pair of variables. Getting to the k parameter, k is the maximum number of variables used in the blocking set. By setting k to 1, we cap the blocking set to 1. As you can see, there is a trade-off between the stringency of the test and the time it takes to run the test.\n\nSetting k too high potentially makes the criteria too stringent and blocks useful variables from being returned. Since, I would rather cast a wider net here, I am setting k to 1. Another benefit of setting k to 1, is that it reduces the run time of the algorithm significantly, which also increases exponentially with the number of variables in the dataset. \n\nThe chosen independence test is RobustRegressionTest, uses the confidence interval of the coefficient of a Huber regression as a measure of the confidence in the determined dependency. The algorithm decides whether to keep an edge between the two variables by comparing the determined confidence interval with the chosen alpha.

One positive aspect of using a causal approach to feature selection is that it yields a simple intuitive model which also compares favorably in terms of performance relative to more complex and less interpretable models. For instance, we only use simple linear regression without any regularization and with a log root mean squared error of .1187 we can expect to be in the top 5% of kaggle submissions. Definitely not the best model out there, but also by far not the worst. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train_reduced = X_train.loc[:,features]\nX_test_reduced = X_test.loc[:,features]\n\n\n#log transform y\ny= pd.DataFrame(np.log1p(yt), columns = ['SalePrice'], index = yt.index)\n\n#automatic outlier detection for X_train reduced\nlof = LocalOutlierFactor(contamination = .005)\nyhat = lof.fit_predict(X_train_reduced)\nmask = yhat != -1\nmask[523] = False\nmask[1298] = False\nmask[297] = False\n\n\noutlier_mask = yhat == -1\n\n\noutlier_mask[523] = True\noutlier_mask[1298] = True\noutlier_mask[297] = True\ny_outliers = y.loc[outlier_mask]\n\n#remove outliers from train set\ny_outliers = y.loc[outlier_mask]\nX_train_reduced_outliers =  X_train_reduced.loc[outlier_mask,:]\nX_train_reduced = X_train_reduced.loc[mask,:]\ny = y.loc[mask]\n\n\nlr = LinearRegression()\nlr.fit(X_train_reduced, y.to_numpy().ravel())\n\n\nms_scorer = make_scorer(lms_score, greater_is_better = False)\nperm = PermutationImportance(lr, random_state=1, scoring = ms_scorer).fit(X_test_reduced.loc[y_val.index],  np.log1p(y_val))\neli5.show_weights(perm, top = 107, feature_names = X_train_reduced.columns.tolist())\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Example: Median Discount for Lack of Central Air\n\nAnother potential benefit of trying to build a model based on actual causal effects is that assuming the model is complete and satisfies the backdoor criterion, as explained, above the model would better predict intervention into the system. For instance, assuming that we owned a house whose current price is about the median price in the dataset, how much could we reasonably expect the price of the house to increase if we installed central air? Below I simulate this scenario by taking the difference between a median valued house with and without central air. As can be seen below, our current model predicts a difference of about $14,605. To tell you the truth I have no idea if that is actually accurate, but assuming we've taken into account all confounding variables we should be able to at least estimate such an intervention. Therefore, if we were hypothetically selling a house without central air we could better decide based on the cost of installation whether it would be worth it to install central air, or perform other remodelling work. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#calcualte the effect of non having central air on a house having a median base price\nc = np.unique(X_train_reduced.CentralAir)*(-.021609)\nprint(np.expm1(c[0] + np.median(y))- np.expm1(c[1] + np.median(y)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Visualization of Model Performance <a id = 'visualize'></a>\n\nThis is just a visualization of model performance.
