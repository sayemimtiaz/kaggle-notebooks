Our goal in this project is to classify which forest type it is from the data given.\n\n- This study area includes 4 Wilderness Areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado. These area represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological process rather than forest management practices.\n\n- Each observation is 30m x 30m forest cover type determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data. Independent variables were derived from the data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data.\n\n- I have been given a total of 54 attributes/features, (excluding 1 target variable) these attributes contain Binary and Quantative attributes, and I need to predict which Forest Cover-Type is it from the given features.\n\n- I will first explore the data, visualize it, know what the data wants to tell us. Remove any missing values and features that have null values and scale the data within a specific range.\n\n- Also perform dimensionality reduction procedure where I will use 4 models to tell us which are useful in order to predict the target variable, and then using features which gives us hgih score in the most models. Those 4 Models are:\n    \n    - Extra Trees Classifier (ETC)\n    - Random Forest (RF)\n    - AdaBoost Classifier (ADBC)\n    - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)\n    \n\n- Split the data 75%-25%, train-test set respectively. Will use 10 K-fold Cross Validation on train set.\n\n- Feed the training data to the Naive Bayes (Our Benchmark Model) and evaluate the result.\n\n- Training will be done on the Solution Models that I have chose, those are:-\n\n    - K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), \n    - Random Forest (RF),\n    - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC),\n    - Extra Trees Classifier (ETC),\n    - Logistic Regression (LG)\n    \n \n- Scores will be evaluated with Accuracy and F1 score metrics.\n\n- Choosing the best model from above based on metrics scores and testing that model on the test set.\n\n- Conclusions\n\nDetailed Info regarding on how I am going to approach this problem and data summary is given in `proposal.pdf` file.

The most densed and near to mean is `Slope` followed by all 3 features of `Hillshade`. [Take a look at plot #1](#Feature-Visualization) in Feature Visualization section.\n\n- All the features have minimum value of `0` except `Elevation` and `Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology` features. Where `Elevation` has the highest minimum value and `Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology` has the lowest, being negative.\n\n- We will document and visualize in detail later for each feature of how spread or dense the data value is between min-25%, 25%-50%, 50%-75% and 75%--max. These are called the percentile. 25% percentile denotes first quaritle, 50% percentile is the median and 75% percentile is the third quartile.

Features like `Aspect` and `Slope` are measured in degrees so its maximum value can't go above `360`. While `Hillshade`s features can take on max value of `255`.

In other words, most observation have features either `Wilderness_Area1` or `Wilderness_Area3`. The least amount of observation will be seen from `Wilderness_Area2`. We will visualize this and `Soil_Type` features later for better understanding these data [Take a look at plot #3](#Feature-Visualization) in Feature Visualization section.\n\n- One more thing to notice here is that when we add all the mean of `Wildernesss_Area`s `0.448864 + 0.051434 + 0.436074 + 0.063627` we get result `0.999999` which is approximately `1`.

Crosschecking, I have also programmed to check whether any obsevation has 2 Wilderness Area and Soil type presence at the same time or None for assurance that our data is in appropriate form in [Observation Cleaning](#Observation-Cleaning) section.\n\n- Hence if we look at this in the probability perspective we can say that, the next observation that we get has `44.8%` probability that its been taken from `Wilderness_Area1`, `43.6%` probability that it's taken from `Wilderness_Area3` and so on for others.

It's densely packed taking on least range compared to all features. Having little range means `mean` and `median` will be quite close and we saw that before in the table, it has a difference of approx 1. It does have a few outliers though.\n\n- `Aspect` feature is the only one which do not have any outliers having a range of 360. Since both `Aspect` and `Slope` are measured in degrees, `Aspect` takes on much bigger range than `Slope` because it has lowest max score, hence `Aspect` is much less densed than `Slope`. The `first 50%` of the data, from `min to meadian` is more densed than the `last 50%`, its more spread out.\n\n- `Hillshade`s feature also having similar plot like `Slope` including many outliers and taking on smaller range.

We can see visually only how spread these are and which one is most. `Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points` may be having largest number of outliers I guess from this plot.

Their medians, interquartile range, skewness, density etc. I will only brief those that are intresting and have valueable information to tell us:\n\n- `Elevation` takes on different range of values for different forest classes. Most of the forest at the elevation between `2000m - 25000m` are of `class 4 forest type` while `class 3 forest type` has fewer presence of such `elevation`. `Class 7 forest type` have the observations of most elevated trees ranging from as low as `~2800m` to as high as `~3800m`. The `'max'` value in `elevation` belongs to `class 7 forest type`. This is the most important feature since every feature tells different story to different classes of forest cover type hence an important feature for our algorithm.\n\n- `Aspect` is the feature that has normal distribution for each class.\n\n- `Slope` feature takes on lower values compared to most features as its measured in degrees and least to `Aspect` which is also measured in degrees. It has the `least maximum` value of all features and by looking the plot above we can say that it belongs to `Forest Cover Type 2`. All classes have dense slope observations between `0-20 degrees`.\n\n- `Horizontal distance to hydrology` has the `right or positively skewed distribution` where most of the values for all classes are towards `0-50m`.\n\n- `Vertical distance to hydrology` is also `positively skewed distribution` but this takes on values much closer to `0` for all classes for most observations.The `highest value` in this feature belongs to `Forest cover type 2`. And this feature also has the `least minimum value` of all features and that also belongs to `class 2 forest type`, hence `class 2` having most range of data observations compared to all other classes.\n\n- `Hillshade_9am` and `Hillshade_Noon` are `left or negatively skewed distributions` where they take on max value between `200-250 index value` for most observations in each class.

Lower degrees represent `class 4 and 6` while high degree values represent `class 1, 2 and 7` also we can see decrease in `Hillshade_Noon` value as slope increases and it geographically makes sense.\n\n- `Vertical and Horizontal Distance to Hydrology` represent a `linear` but spreaded out type, not a single line fit to all datapoints. `Class type 7 and 2` have more observation here and spreaded out while `class type 3 and 6` are densely packed between the range `0-800m` of `Horizontal Distance to Hydrology`.\n\n- ` Hilshade_9am and Hillshade_3pm` figure represents relationship of a sliced-out part of a circle where top most of the datapoints belong to `class 3` and middle and bottom area belong to rest of the classes.\n\n- `Hillshade_Noon and Hillshade_3pm` have similar observation as described before just a difference here is that it's flipped over y-aixs.

I will use 10 K-Fold CV to test the performance of our model. I had choosen Naive Bayes Classifier as my benchmark model and I am going to use **`Multimonial Naive Bayes classifier`** since we have a claasification problem to solve.\n\nThe `Evaluation Metric` I am going to use are `f1 score` and `accuracy` to see how well our model performs.\n\n- `Accuracy` is the measure of the correct predicted data divided by total number of observations hence giving a value ranging between `0 and 1`, while `0` is no correctly predicted class whereas `1` is all correctly predicted class. We can multiply the result by `100` to get the accuracy score in terms of percent.\n\n- `F1 score` is more useful than accuracy specially in the case where you have uneven amount of class distribution as in our case. It's the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. \n\n-  `Accuracy` works best if false positives and false negatives have similar cost. If the cost of false positives and false negatives are very different, it’s better to look at both Precision and Recall or `F1 score`. \n\nFirst I will define a function which will train the `models` using training data and calculate model's performance using `accuracy` and `f1 score`.

Clearly all models beating our benchmark model.**\n\n- `KNN` performs here stunningly awesome, getting accuracy `92.39%` and `87.07%` of F1 score. Though it takes highest training and evaluation time there but it has gotten results very well.\n\n- `Random Forest` here gets highest accuracy result of `93.37%` taking seconds to train and couple of minutes running cross validation and metrics results. Also given its flexibility it has perofrmed so well with default params.\n\n- `Stochastic Gradient Descent` has shocked me with its accuracy and F1 score results. In proposal I had mentioned that this and Random Forest would be really intresting to see as their results might be really high and close enough and would be tough call to pick but it turned out to be opposite now. Might some tuning in parameter would get a little better result but I dont think it would beat Random Forest or Extra Trees Classifier and that was the whole point as discussed before, to see results based on default params of models. SGDC has least training and evaluation time.\n\n- `Extra Trees` gets highest F1 score result of `89.14%` hasn't disappointed with its metrics results and runtime, both RFC and this have close call on accuracy having less than a percent difference and similar runtimes.\n\n- `Logistic Regression` has similar results as `SGDC` but has better F1 score and takes more time in evaluation. But for LR, an expected results atleast for me.\n\n- Benchmark model used here `Multinomial Naive Bayes`, has been beaten by all models above that I chose for solution both in terms of accuracy and F1 score.\n\nChoosing best classifiers among these 3 which are bold in table is little tight atleast between `RF` and `ETC`. `KNN` have preformed well predicting classes, `n_neighbors`, which is the parameter of `KNN`, set to `5` by default has done it but it just took alot of evaluation time also train time was highest among all but its reasonable in general atleast for this particular data. \n\nSo to pick one model I would consider not only having best accuracy score but also `F1 score` since `F1 scores` are more important as they give us an weighted average score of both `precision` and `recall`, where `precision` is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative and `recall` it's the number of positive prediction divided by the number of positive class values and `F1 score` is the balance of both of these. Let us dig deep into f1 before we choose our final model.\n\nSo all that said, hows it calculated, whats the formula? Let us see....\n\n$$F1=2 \\cdot \\frac{𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 \\cdot 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙}{𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙}$$\n\nwhere `Precision` is calculated by..\n\n$$Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$\n\nand `Recall` is calculated by....\n\n$$Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$\n\n`ETC` do have here high F1 score by 0.005 but it has lower accuracy score of 0.43 compared to `RFC`.\n\nSo with that said, **I will be picking `Random Forest` as my final model to evaluate on the test set and see its performance on it.** Will it perform better or same?
