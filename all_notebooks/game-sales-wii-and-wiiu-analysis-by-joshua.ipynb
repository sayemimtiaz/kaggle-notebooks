Wii Sports for Wii**\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/37/45/d0/3745d001d4977eb9d1c08063403eeb11.gif)\n\nThe classic sports game for family game night or get togethers, this game was released in 2006 for Nintendo Wii that includes 5 main game types (Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Bowling, and Boxing). This game can be played by simply swinging the Wii remote replicating the moves in game. I've played this game when my parents bought Wii console for my family, and I think that its simplicity is what makes this game really famous.\n#### **2. Super Mario Bros for NES**\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/dd/d7/63ddd7f601b6c9961e83fc5f45bd67f5.gif)\n\nI mean, who doesn't know this game. Super Mario Bros was released starting from 1985 in NA and Japan and 1987 in EU and AUS. This game makes the player takes the role of a plumber named Mario with his quest to save his love, Peach in which he must get past traps set by Mario's arch nemesis named Bowser. This game is the definer for the rise of video games.\n#### **3. Mario Kart Wii for Wii**\n![](https://i.makeagif.com/media/4-12-2017/NE1Ocj.gif)\n\nMario Kart Wii is a racing game that was released in 2008 that makes players race each other or versus bots using characters from Super Mario Games. The player could equip certain objects that can distract the enemies or help the player to win the race. This game is the 2nd top sold Nintendo Wii games of all time !\n#### **4. Wii Sports Resorts for Wii**\n![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MadRichBaleenwhale-max-1mb.gif)\n\nThis game could be called as the sequel for the Wii Sports. Wii Sports Resorts was released back in 2009 and includes Wii Motion Plus which is needed to play the game. This game added more game types, and the characters move is more accurate with the help of Wii Motion Plus.\n#### **5. Pokemon Red / Pokemon Blue for Gameboy**\n![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CreepyRequiredFirecrest-small.gif)\n\nI remember seeing all of my friends brought their Gameboy equipped with this game to school when I was in elementary. Pokemon Red / Pokemon Blue was released in 1995 that takes player to a journey of the protagonist to become the best pokemon master. The gameplay includes the player to battle and capture many types of Pokemons.

It places 4th overall, a really good place considering other Nintendo Consoles don't make it into this list. This shows that something is or are really right with this console. Searching more and experiencing the console myself, I think there are some points that makes this console really popular and became a massive success for Nintendo:\n* **Easy Control Scheme :**\nMan, it's really easy to use the Wii controller, the controller is just like following human's movement nature. Want to go to certain menu ? just point the controller to the menu, press A and done. Want to swing the tennis racket to play Wii Sports Tennis ? Just swing it like how you play tennis in real life. It is really easy to get into especially for non-hardcore gamers. This fact is one of the factor that helps sells Nintendo Wii to many kind of person.\n* **Family Friendly :**\nLets just be clear here, like almost all of Nintendo Wii Games are family friendly and local-multiplayer friendly games (except certain games like : Call of Duty, Resident Evil, and some more, see some of them [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/top10/2114-the-top-10-m-rated-wii-games)) but it is very few compared to the family oriented games like Wii Sports, Wii Party, Super Mario, Carnival, and still many more !\n* **Fun Alternative For Family Workouts :**\nThis fact is not scientifically proven, but most of the time when me and my parents were playing Wii games like Wii sports tennis, we produced some sweats that could mean burned calories (?). Well at least this fact is what me and my sister used as an excuse to buy this console.\n\n![](https://media4.giphy.com/media/l3vR3fQOflHXJGq9a/giphy.gif)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With the success of Nintendo Wii, Nintendo wanted to follow the wave and develops a new successor for the Wii. Well, that brought us to Nintendo WiiU, the younger brother of Wii. WiiU is like a bittersweet love for many gamers, they wanted to like it (well many do !) but in the end, it doesn't do well. ***Lets analyze WiiU more deeply in the next section !***"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"4\"></a> <br>\n> # **4. Why Nintendo WiiU Is A Flop Compared to Nintendo Wii**\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"WiiU was released in 2012 and the console includes the main console with a new controller called WiiU gamepad.

But innovative doesn't mean high sales, so lets see how WiiU does in term of its game sales.\n\n![](https://d2pa5gi5n2e1an.cloudfront.net/webp/global/images/product/gameconsoles/Nintendo_Wii_U/Nintendo_Wii_U_L_1.jpg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets see the WiiU total game sales"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Total Wii Games Sales (in million) : ',data_vg[data_vg.Platform == 'WiiU'].Global_Sales.sum())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Wow, a really decreased number compared to its predecessor.

Well, it is true that this is one of the newer console and the age is still young compared to other consoles, but with the release of Nintendo Switch in early 2017, I think that WiiU games sales is not going to go head to head with Wii's sales."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I don't have this console personally, but I have seen their advertisements and review in many internet websites. From them, I believe that the console itself is good but everything else is a lackluster. There are some things that, at least for me, made WiiU a failure :\n\n* **Really Confusing Controller Scheme :** This is the number one reason for me. Previous Wii Gamers went into WiiU with the mindset of WiiU is an upgraded Wii, but with the addition of the WiiU gamepad it makes it confusing. In a party games like Wii Party U or Mario Party 10, the players need to use normal Wii controllers (they might need to buy it themself !) with an additional WiiU gamepad and the usage is really confusing concept, well at least for me.\n\n* **Nintendo's Market Target :** WiiU is targeted for children. This may not be a problem because Wii is also a family oriented console, but this I think create a wrong hardware choices. Because usually in a Nintendo games, family oriented games don't need high performance hardware capability because of their cartoony and simple graphics. This creates a new problem that I take on the next point\n\n* **Underpowered Machine :** With the rise of AAA games at that time like Grand Theft Auto 5, Watch Dogs, and many more, WiiU is not a platform choice for the developer because the difficulty of porting and its underpowered machine compared to PS3 and XBOX 360. This makes WiiU placed in some sort of limbo in which it creates an exclusivity, but it is not a choice for AAA games developers. This doesn't mean mature games didn't have a place in WiiU, look at Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2, it's just that WiiU is not a choice for multi-platform AAA games.\\\n\nThose are the reasons for why I think WiiU flopped, if you want to know more there is a good article [here](https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-the-wii-u-is-a-failure-2498588) that lists why WiiU flops.\n\n![](https://i.gifer.com/Rf9J.gif)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **FOR NOW,** \nthat is all from me.
