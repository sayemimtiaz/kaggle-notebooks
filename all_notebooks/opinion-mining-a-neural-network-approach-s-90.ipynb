embedding layer.\n#### Word Embedding\n    This is a very popular set of models that maps words from the vocab into an numerical vectors. \n    These models help the computer “understand” the semantic and syntactical similarity between words and\n    the context of the word regarding to the document.\n    The word represented by dense vector; similar words will be represented as similar vectors.\n    \n#### Word2Vec \n    At the year of 2013, Mikolov a researcher at google labs suggested a new model. This model is one\n    of the most popular models up to this day.\n    This model uses unsupervised shallow neural network with one hidden layer.\n    There are two different model architectures which can be leveraged by Word2Vec to create these\n    word embedding representations:\n\n##### Continuous Bag of words (CBoW)\n    The input of this architecture is bunch of words (vectors) and the output is one word (as vector).\n    As a matter of fact, this architecture tries to understand what the word by looking on its surroundings,\n    we can look at this as “tell me who your friends and family and I will tell you who you are”\n##### Skip Gram\n    This is the opposite of CBoW architecture, in this model the input is one word and the output are the\n    surrounding words of this word.\n    According to Mikolov those to architectures behave differently, and each one of them has its own\n    pros and cons.\n    The skip-gram model works better with smaller amount of data and can represent rear words better\n    than CBoW. On the other hand, CBoW is faster and can represent better words that appears more\n    frequently.\n\n##### FastText \n    This model  firstly introduced by Facebook in the year of 2016 as an extension of Word2Vec.\n    The main improvement over Word2Vec is the use of sub- word information meaning, while Word2Vec\n    tries to find a unique vector for each word, the FastText tries to find a vector for sequences of chars\n    within each word.

insights\n   as we can see, our best validation score is  0.8827 (not bad) but: **we have overfiting!**\n\n  \n#### Overfiting!\n    overfiting ocuurs when the model starts to memorize instead of learning or understanding,\n    in this scenario the model will give us a good results on the train set \n    but very bad on dev/test (on un-seen samples). \n    this situation is similar to a student that learns to an exam by memorizing two past exams,\n    well sure if he gets by some miracle one of those past exams (aka. data leakage) he will succeed,\n    but if he will get a completely new exam, he will fail.\n    \n    overfiting ussally occurs when our model is too complex for the data.\n      \n  we can handle overfiting with the following tequnices:\n    1. early stopping. we do not need this becuase we are saving the best model.\n    2. regularization: intituvly give pennalty to noise\n       (or to something that allmost all the time irelvent and relvant only for some minor scenarios).\n    3. dropout (also one of the regularization technique:\n       randomaly remove a set of connections between the neurons (disable features,make neurons not to fire).\n    4. reducing the nn’s capacity(reduce trainable params):\n       too many params can add noise, to little can miss importent data.\n    5. add data.   \n       \nmost of our network is simple as is, let's try to neglect FastText and let the network try and learn new word embeddings from scratch on smaller latent space.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Model2:
