Thus, the target variable corresponds to RainTomorrow which indicates if it rained tomorrow or not, and there are variables such as temperature, evaporation, wind speed and direction, humidity, pressure, among others, with which it seeks to respond to the objective.\n\nUnder this context, sklearn classification algorithms will be used, namely:\n\n* Logistic Regression Classification (Parametric)\n* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification (Non parametric)\n* Naive Bayes Classification (Parametric)\n* Decision Tree Classification (Non parametric)\n* Random Forest Classification (Non parametric)\n* K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classification (Non parametric)\n\nAfter implementing each classification model, a comparison is made with the confusion matrix methods. It is noteworthy that the variable RiskMM (amount of rainfall in millimeters for the next day) was used to create the binary object of analysis. For example, if RISKMM was greater than 0, then the RainTomorrow target variable is equal to Yes. Since it contains information about the future, and since it contains information directly about the target variable, including it would leak the future information to the model. Therefore, it is excluded in the analysis.

This technique uses the logistic function or sigmoid function, which is an S-shaped curve that can assume any real value number and assign it to a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly in those limits. Thus, logistic regression models the probability of the default class (the probability that an input $(X)$ belongs to the default class $(Y=1)$) $(P(X)=P(Y=1|X))$. In order to make the prediction of the probability, the logistic function is used, which allows us to obtain the log-odds or the probit. Thus, the model is a linear combination of the inputs, but that this linear combination relates to the log-odds of the default class.\n\nWe started make an instance of the model setting the default values.

SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification\n\nSVMs (Support Vector Machine) have shown a rapid proliferation during the last years. The learning problem setting for SVMs corresponds to a some unknown and nonlinear dependency (mapping, function) $y = f(x)$ between some high-dimensional input vector $x$ and scalar output $y$. It is noteworthy that there is no information on the joint probability functions, therefore, a free distribution learning must be carried out. The only information available is a training data set $D = {(x_i, y_i) ∈ X×Y }, i = 1$, $l$, where $l$ stands for the number of the training data pairs and is therefore equal to the size of the training data set $D$, additionally, $y_i$ is denoted as $d_i$, where $d$ stands for a desired (target) value. Hence, SVMs belong to the supervised learning techniques.\n\nFrom the classification approach, the goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that clearly classifies the data points. Thus hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes.\n\nAs in the previous case, we started by defining the model. Thus, we choose a penalty parameter equal to 10 because around this the best test score is presented ((C = 0.1 - TS = 0.836), (C = 1.0 - TS =0.848), (C =10.0 - TS = 0.8503), (C = 100.0 - TS = 0.851)). The type of kernel used corresponds to RBF (Radial Basis Function), this kernel nonlinearly maps samples into a higher dimensional space, so it, unlike the linear kernel, can handle the case when the relation between class labels and attributes is nonlinear, additionally, the RBF kernel has fewer numerical difficulties and uses fewer hyperparameters than the polynomial kernel.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\n\n# We define the SVM model\nsvmcla = OneVsRestClassifier(BaggingClassifier(SVC(C=10,kernel='rbf',random_state=9, probability=True), \n                                               n_jobs=-1))\n\n# We train model\nsvmcla.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n# We predict target values\nY_predict2 = svmcla.predict(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The confusion matrix\nsvmcla_cm = confusion_matrix(Y_test, Y_predict2)\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5,5))\nsns.heatmap(svmcla_cm, annot=True, linewidth=0.7, linecolor='cyan', fmt='g', ax=ax, cmap=\"YlGnBu\")\nplt.title('SVM Classification Confusion Matrix')\nplt.xlabel('Y predict')\nplt.ylabel('Y test')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Test score\nscore_svmcla = svmcla.score(X_test, Y_test)\nprint(score_svmcla)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.

Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:\n\n* Let $N$ be the number of test cases, $M$ is the number of variables in the classifier.\n* Let $m$ be the number of input variables to be used to determine the decision in a given node; $m<M$.\n* Choose a training set for this tree and use the rest of the test cases to estimate the error.\n* For each node of the tree, randomly choose $m$ variables on which to base the decision. Calculate the best partition of the training set from the $m$ variables.\n\nFor prediction a new case is pushed down the tree. Then it is assigned the label of the terminal node where it ends.

Conclusions\n\nThe results indicate that the random forest technique presents the best results in terms of prediction followed by SVM and logistic regression with test scores close to 85%. The worst results were presented by the naive bayes technique, which may be associated with the assumptions of the model, particularly the assumption of independence. In general, parametric methods (logistic regression and naive bayes) have a higher speed in learning the data, in contrast to non-parametric methods, which require more time to train the parameters. Considering the computation time within the best scores, logistic regression exhibits the best results, followed by random forest, while SVM requires considerable time to perform the calculations. Regarding the reduction of dimensionality, the techniques carried out have worse results, in particular the test scores are reduced by going from 57 to 45 features."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
