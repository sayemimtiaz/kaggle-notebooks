Problem Statement\n\n\n### 1.1 Introduction :\n\nThe **Premier League** is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by **20 clubs**, it operates promotion and relegation with the English Football League. Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away)\n\nThe league held its **first season in 1992–93**. It was composed of **22 clubs for that season**.The number of clubs was reduced to **20, down from 22, in 1995** when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.\n\nThe league changed its name from the FA Premier League to simply the Premier League in 2007.\n\n\n<img src ='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IshaanM24/EDA/master/Images/PL/cup.jpg' >\n\n\n\nThe dataset availabe is used to explore the **English Premier League data**, so as to understand how it has fared across different seasons and evolved over the years. \n\n**Analysis to be Performed :** \n\n- Season level Analysis for football parameters - Matches, Wins, Losses, Goals(Home and Away), Comebacks.\n- Team level analysis for football parameters - Matches, Wins, Losses, Goals(Home and Away), Comebacks.\n- Anaylsis of Team per Season - Points Table, Champions, Runner's up, Relegation, League Progress\n\n**Try to Answer :**\n\n- Important Considerations to Sustain in the league (not being relegated)\n- How can a Team improve the chances to Win the League ?\n- Important factor to win a League - Attack or Defence?\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=section2></a>\n## 2.

Conclusions : ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- First 2 seasons of Premier League had **22 teams which was reduced to 20 teams from the 1995-96 season**. As per our analysis, it looks like the Quality of games was low in the initial seasons and may have triggered the move to reduce the number of teams. Another possible reason to reduce teams could be number of games(days) in a season as there is a break needed for International Games as well in between.\n- All seasons have **more Home Goals than Away goals** hinting towards **possible Home Ground Advantage for goal scoring**.\n- **Manchester United** have emerged as the most consistent and successful club in the Premier League History in terms of **Goals Scored**, **Wins** [Home(**73%**) and Away(**55%**)], **Draws**, **Loss** [Home(**10%**) and Away(**22%**)], **Goals Conceded** and **Titles Won (12)**. \n- **Arsenal**, **Chelsea**, **Everton**, **Liverpool**, **Man United** and **Tottenham** have played in all **25 Seasons**.\n- **Maximum Wins** in a single season is in **Season 2017-18** -> **Man City with 32 wins**\n- **Minimum Wins** is in **Season 2007-08** -> **Derby with 1 win**\n- **Most Defeats** in a Season is in **Season 1994-95 , 2005-06 and 2007-08** -> **Ipswich**, **Sunderland** and **Derby** respectively with **29 Defeats**\n- **Least Defeats** is in **Season 2003-04** -> **Arsenal with 0 defeats**\n- **Maximum Points** in a single season is in **Season 2017-18** -> **Manchester City with 100 points**\n- **Minimum Points** is in **Season 2007-08** -> **Derby with 11 points**\n- **Maximum Goal Difference** in a single season is in **Season 2017-18** -> **Manchester City with +79 Goal Diff**\n- **Minimum Goal Difference** is in **Season 2007-08** -> **Derby with -69 Goal Diff**\n- **Maximum Goals Scored** in a single season is in **Season 2017-18** -> **Manchester City with 106 Goals**\n- **Minimum Goals Scored** is in **Season 2007-08** -> **Derby with 20 Goals**\n- **Maximum Goals Conceded** in a single season is in **Season 1993-94** -> **Swindon with 100 Goals**\n- **Minimum Goals Conceded** is in **Season 2004-05** -> **Chelsea with 15 Goals**\n\n- A Team with **Best Goal Difference** in a Season **Won the Title 68% of the times.**\n\n- In terms of **Half Time Comebacks**, **Arsenal** and **Manchester United** are the teams leading at **Home** and **Away** with **18** and **19** comebacks, respectively.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=section601></a>\n#### 6.1.

Possible reasons for the same are Home Crowd creating pressure on the Away Teams behaving as a non playing 12th man and alsoacquintance with **\"Ground Size and Pitch\"** with the daily practices. While crows is something that is not controllable, there could possibly be a standardaization done with ground sizes and Pitches to mitigate the advantage.
