For example, when working with Kickstarter data, you can calculate the number of total projects in the last week and the duration of the fundraising period. The features you create are different for every dataset, so it takes a bit of creativity and experimentation. We're a bit limited here, since we're working with only one table. Typically you'll have access to multiple tables with relevant data that you can use to create new features.\n\nBut you can still see how to make new features using categorical features, and then a few examples of generated numerical features.
