In order to address any of the specific research questions posed in the 10 tasks for this challenge, it will be useful to organize the corpus into meaningful topical areas and focus on the subset of documents most closely related to the question at hand.  There are many different approaches to the task of unsupervised clustering of documents and topic modeling.  On such approach is to organize the documents into a citation network and cluster documents together using an appropriate community detection algorithm, which has two important advantages:\n* Researchers self-organize into communities focused around graular topic areas, and a citation network model naturally leverages this information to cluster documents.\n* Using citations to documents outside of the corpus enriches the dataset with additional external information.\n\nIn this submission, we provide simple tools to construct a citation network and demonstrate how it can be used to quickly identify a cluster of documents related to a particular task, specifically the following question:  \n* What do we know about co-infections (determine whether co-existing respiratory/viral infections make the virus more transmissible or virulent) and other co-morbidities."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Authored by the Regeneron Machine Learning Club:\n* [Leland Barnard](https://www.kaggle.com/lbvigilantdata) (leland.barnard@gmail.com)\n* [ytisserant](https://www.kaggle.com/ytisserant) (ytisserant@gmail.com)\n* [cfmleig](https://www.kaggle.com/cfmleig) (cf.mleig@gmail.com)\n* [Aly Hafez](https://www.kaggle.com/alyhafez95) (alyhafez95@gmail.com)\n* [Jingggggggg](https://www.kaggle.com/jingggggggg) (Violet.hj@gmail.com)\n* [OZhuYuan](https://www.kaggle.com/ozhuyuan) (yuanzhu26@gmail.com)\n* [Katie Gayvert](https://www.kaggle.com/katiegayvert) (katiegayvert@gmail.com)\n* [Daren Liu](https://www.kaggle.com/darenliu94) (darenliu@berkeley.edu)\n* [Rickcopin](https://www.kaggle.com/rickcopin) (rickcopin@gmail.com)\n* [jfkaggles](https://www.kaggle.com/jfpostbox) (jan.freudenberg@gmail.com)\n* [Kevia Q](https://www.kaggle.com/keviaq) (kevia.q@gmail.com)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nImage(filename='/kaggle/input/citationnetworkfigure/citationNetwork.png', width=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Documents 1, 2, and 3 from the corpus are likely to be related because they all cite a common external article."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For readability and portability, the bulk of the code for this submission is organized in an external repository, which can installed via pip:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install git+https://github.com/ReReMLclub/cord19utils.git/ --quiet","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Documentation for cord19utils is available in the repository README: https://github.com/ReReMLclub/cord19utils"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Citation Network Model\nUsing the bibliographic information provided for each document in the corpus, a citation network model is constructed by creating nodes for each document in the corpus as well as the external artcles that they site.
