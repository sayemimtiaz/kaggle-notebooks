Click on the blue button **Copy&Edit** in th top right corner, this will open a copy of the notebook in your account. You don't have to download anything, it runs completely online.\n2. Enable the **Internet** of the notebook on the right side under Settings (you need to verify your account first). This is required to install some packages.\n3. Run the code cell in the section **Setup** (the cell might me collapsed, click expand to see it), this will load all the necessary files and models. (To run a cell you can press Shift+Enter or press the play button).\n4. Pick a widget you want to use, run the corresponding cell and you are good to go!\n\nPlease let me know if the suggestions are useful or if you want me to add some
