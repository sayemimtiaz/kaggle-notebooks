Relation between app category and app price\nSo now comes the hard part.

Sentiment analysis of user reviews¶\nMining user review data to determine how people feel about your product, brand,\nor service can be done using a technique called sentiment analysis.\nUser reviews for apps can be analyzed to identify if the mood is positive, negative or neutral about that app.\nFor example, positive words in an app review might include words such as 'amazing', 'friendly', 'good', 'great', and 'love'. \nNegative words might be words like 'malware', 'hate', 'problem', 'refund', and 'incompetent'.\n\nBy plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps,\nwe observe that free apps receive a lot of harsh comments, as indicated by the outliers on the negative y-axis.\nReviews for paid apps appear never to be extremely negative. This may indicate something about app quality, i.e.,\npaid apps being of higher quality than free apps on average.\nThe median polarity score for paid apps is a little higher than free apps, thereby syncing with our previous observation.\n\nIn this notebook, we analyzed over ten thousand apps from the Google Play Store.\nWe can use our findings to inform our decisions should we ever wish to create an app ourselves.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load user_reviews.csv\nreviews_df = pd.read_csv('../input/user_reviews.csv')\n\n# Join and merge the two dataframe\nmerged_df = pd.merge(apps, reviews_df, on = 'App', how = \"inner\")\n\n# Drop NA values from Sentiment and Translated_Review columns\nmerged_df = merged_df.dropna(subset=['Sentiment', 'Translated_Review'])\n\nmerged_df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# User review sentiment polarity for paid vs. free apps\nsns.set_style('ticks')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nfig.set_size_inches(11, 8)\nax = sns.boxplot(x = 'Type', y = 'Sentiment_Polarity', data = merged_df)\nax.set_title('Sentiment Polarity Distribution')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
