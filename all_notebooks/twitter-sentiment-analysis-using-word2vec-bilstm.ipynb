Since normally, NLP models cannot parse those data, we need to clean up the tweet and replace tokens that actually contains meaningful information for the model.\n\n**The Preprocessing steps taken are:**\n1. **Lower Casing:** Each text is converted to lowercase.\n2. **Replacing URLs:** Links starting with **'http' or 'https' or 'www'** are replaced by **'<url\\>'**.\n3. **Replacing Usernames:** Replace @Usernames with word **'<user\\>'**. [eg: '@Kaggle' to '<user\\>'].\n4. **Replacing Consecutive letters:** 3 or more consecutive letters are replaced by 2 letters. [eg: 'Heyyyy' to 'Heyy']\n5. **Replacing Emojis:** Replace emojis by using a regex expression. [eg: ':)' to '<smile\\>']\n6. **Replacing Contractions:** Replacing contractions with their meanings. [eg: \"can't\" to 'can not']\n7. **Removing Non-Alphabets:** Replacing characters except Digits, Alphabets and pre-defined Symbols with a space.\n\nAs much as the preprocessing steps are important, the actual sequence is also important while cleaning up the text.
