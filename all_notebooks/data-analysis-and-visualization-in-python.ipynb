In this kernel, we will use [Stanford's Open Policing Project Dataset](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) from California to analyze police stops and whether police treat minority groups unfairly. You can find their working paper [here](https://5harad.com/papers/traffic-stops.pdf) and another recently published paper using the same data [here](https://5harad.com/papers/threshold-test.pdf). \n\nIn this tutorial, we'll be focusing on manipulating **Pandas DataFrames**, using MultiIndexing, DateTime Index and Slicing, and applying Boolean Masks. We will also use **Matplotlib** for Time Series, Bar Graphs, and Scatterplots. \n\nIf you have any questions or corrections for this tutorial, feel free to comment them or ask for clarification. If you want to run this notebook yourself and play around with the data, just click \"fork\" at the top of the page. And if this kernel helped you learn something, I would appreciate it if you would leave an upvote! \n\nDisclaimer: Discrimination Testing requires complex statistical analysis that is far beyond the scope of this kernel. As I'll discuss later, drawing political conclusions from the analysis we do here would certainly be premature given the simplicity of the analysis we do here and the lack of outside data. Please use this kernel to learn more about Pandas and Matplotlib, not as \"evidence\" for your next Thanksgiving dinner or heated argument.\n\n#**Table of Contents**\n\n**1.

Introducing Search Rate and Hit Rate**\nTo determine if there are racial disparities in traffic stops, we will utilize two commonly used tests: the benchmark and outcome tests. Simply put, the Benchmark tests examines the proportion of stopped cars that are then searched i.e. the search rate, as broken down by race. The Outcome Test then looks at the the proportion of *searched cars* that actually end up having contraband i.e. the hit rate, as broken down by race. We would expect that if racial profiling of minorities exists, then minorities would have a higher search rate than their white peers and a lower or comparable hit rate as their white peers.\n\nHowever, as discussed by the same Stanford academics who brought you this dataset, the Benchmark and Outcome tests are not rigorous tests of discrimination and can be fooled by the problem of *infra-marginality*.  The infra-marginal problem arises in discrimination testing when different population groups have different underlying probability distributions. As discussed in [their paper](https://5harad.com/papers/threshold-test.pdf), different signal distributions of the liklihood of posessing contraband for different populations can lead to misleading results from the benchmark and outcome tests. \n\nMore broadly, it is important as Data Scientists to consider possible external factors. For instance, if african americans in a certain county commit a disproportionate amount of drug crimes, then it might be reasonable that african americans are stopped at a higher rate-though the legality of doing so is dubious. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, it would be foolish to draw conclusions from the analysis in this kernel alone. Instead, we will simply use this dataset as practice for plotting and analyzing data in Python.

In each scatterplot, we will plot a 45 deg line, which is where most counties should lie if there is no difference in search rates between whites and minorities. Thus, if a county lies far above the line, it is much more likely to search blacks than whites.

What now?**\nCongratulations on making it through this kernel! For future work, you can try to more conclusively examine Shasta County's traffic stops and look for more racial disparities. Cross-examining state data, all of which are available on kaggle, can also highlight differences in policing across states, as we saw with NC and CA. In addition, the Stanford paper published with this dataset utilized a method called the [Threshold Test](https://5harad.com/papers/threshold-test.pdf) to conclusively determine racial discrimination, which would be interesting to implement, but does require some higher-level math.\n\nI hope you've found this tutorial helpful and learned something about Matplotlib and Pandas.
