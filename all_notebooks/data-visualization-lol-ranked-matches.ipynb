Business Understanding\n\n### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>`About League of Legends`<ins> :\nDeveloped by Riot Studios, League of Legends, or \"LoL\", is an online multiplayer\nvideo-game that is available to Windows/MacOS users. LoL consists 2 teams ('Blue\n& 'Red') facing each other, where the main objective is to destroy the opposing\nteams 'Nexus', or home base, while facing obstacles like destroying damage dealing\ntowers & eliminating players throughout the way. Perks & gold are able to be\nobtained by players/teams through completing tasks such as eliminating players,\nenemy creeps, or dragons. Players then spend the gold to purchase items that help\nraise the power of their abilities.\n\nLeague of Legends offers different game modes, such as ranked. In this game mode,\nplayers are given a rank based off of the number of wins + the number of games\nplayed. \"Diamond\" is one of the highest ranks a player may obtain and is known\nto be extremely competitive. A ranked game on average lasts 30-45 minutes. The\ndataset we will be using contains the first 10 minute analytics of each team\nfor different diamond ranked matches.\n\nOnce the data is analyzed, teams/players would be able to conceptualize the level\nof priority different attributes have during early stages of diamond ranked\nmatches. They could then use this information to adjust their strategy to one\nproven to win matches.\n\nAdditionally, players who are accustomed to playing as the 'jungle' role (a player\nrole that focuses on obtaining objective eliminations within the jungle areas of\nthe map) can use this analyzed data to better understand the impact elite monsters\nhave on winning games.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nDataset : https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min\n\nQuestion Of Interest : As of the first 10 minutes, which team will win?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

A couple things to point out:\n- If no elite monsters are obtained within the first 10 minutes of playing, ~60% of the time they are shown to lose.\n- A 'jungler' should prioritize on eliminating a dragon before a herald, as a dragon seems to yield a %60 win rate.\n- Out of ~5,000 diamond ranked matches where blue team won, only in ~700 games was blue team able to eliminate both a\ndragon and herald within the first 10 minutes.
