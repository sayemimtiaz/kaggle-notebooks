When coding, this library is written as **sklearn**, as you will see in the sample code. Scikit-learn is easily the most popular library for modeling the types of data typically stored in DataFrames. \n\nThe steps to building and using a model are:\n* **Define:** What type of model will it be?  A decision tree?  Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.\n* **Fit:** Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.\n* **Predict:** Just what it sounds like\n* **Evaluate**: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.\n\nHere is an example of defining a decision tree model with scikit-learn and fitting it with the features and target variable."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"source":"from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\n\n# Define model.
