Rating the cashiers' performance**.\nWe need to rate the relative performance of each cashier compared to performance of the other cashiers. For instance, if four cashiers of equal qualification were working at the same time, we can assume that each of them will \"earn\" 25% of total supermarket revenue. Of course, we couldn't rely on this on the small data blocks, since all clients with expensive goods may prefer one cashier to another, but we have a relatively large dataset here.\n\n**2. Calculating $\\mathtt{t}_{min}$, $\\mathtt{t}_{proc}$ and $\\mathtt{t}_{change}$ for every cashier**.\nThese values can be used in further models. They may be used to justify special ways to reduce one or more of them. Unfortunately, we don't have crucial information - a number of items in every check.\n\n**3. Does the supermarket need more cash registers or cashiers?**\nWe don't have information about the time that clients spend in the queue, but we can determine the crisis situations by the increased number of simultaneously working cashiers. If the periods of time when a lot of cashiers were working are regular and don't end quickly, then we need to increase the number of cashiers or at least re-organize their work.\n\n**4. Does the supermarket need to re-organize some cash registers?**\nSupermarket can designate some cash registers to work \"only without change\", \"only up to five items\" and so on. Will that help the supermarket to get rid of the crisis situations or not? To answer this questions we need to determine the ratios of such checks, especially in times of crisis.\n\n**5. Determining importance of cashiers' fatigue**.\nCashiers obviously aren't automatons, and they get tired after several hours of work. We need to determine the level of dependence between cashiers' performance and their fatigue. If that dependence would appear to be very strong, then we could suggest to reduce the shift time or organize the breaks."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Weekends and holidays\nSupermarkets obviously work differently on weekends and holidays.
