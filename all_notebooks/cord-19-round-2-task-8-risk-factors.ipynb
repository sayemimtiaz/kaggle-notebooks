In response to the pandemic, the [CORD-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) including scholarly articles related to COVID-19 was created for global research community to generate helpful insight for the ongoing combat against this infectious disease using state-of-the-art text mining, NLP and other AI technologies. The [CORD-19 competition](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) was organized by Kaggle as a call for actions to develop tools and information for answering scientific questions with high priority. [Round \\#2](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/discussion/150921) of the [CORD-19 challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) asked participants to create summary tables with specific structures derived by expert curators.\n\nTo tackle the challenges, we have organized a collaborative team including scientists from [Insilicom Inc.](https://insilicom.com/) and the department of statistics of Florida State University. Insilicom specializes in providing innovative technologies to help scientists effectively use Big Data to accelerate their research and development efforts. It recently developed the [Biomedical Knowledge Discovery Engine (BioKDE)](https://biokde.com/), a deep-learning powered search engine for biomedical literature. \n\nOur information extraction pipeline consists of the following components. \nFirst, based on the [CORD-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge), we developed a dataset which is clean and annotated with different entities such as genes, disease, chemicals, etc. using [PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/index.html), [BeFree](http://ibi.imim.es/befree/) and [scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) annotated entities; Second, we used extended keywords to query articles relevant to a paticular topic; Third, we used synonyms to further increase the coverage of the retrieved relevant articles; Fourth, we used regular expressions to extract specific information for filling certain columns of the tables; Fifth, we parsed the relevant sentences to obtain typed dependency graphs, which were used to compute the shortest pathes between relevant keywords, such as chemical names and COVID-19 related terms. The shortest pathes are used to further curate the relevant sentences. They will also be used in the future for building predictive models for the corresponding information extraction tasks; Finally, we have manually verified the summary tables before submitting to obtain a manually curated dataset, which can be used in future studies as benchmark data. These manually curated data can also be used to build machine learning models. \n\n**Task 8** is to [create summary tables that address risk factor studies related to COVID-19](http://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=888). To be more specific, the goal is to create summary tables report about:\n* Hypertension\n* Diabetes\n* Male gender\n* Heart Disease\n* COPD\n* Smoking Status\n* Age\n* Cerebrovascular disease\n* Cardio- and cerebrovascular disease\n* Cancer\n* Respiratory system diseases\n* Chronic kidney disease\n* Chronic respiratory diseases\n* Drinking\n* Overweight or obese\n* Chronic liver disease\n* Asthma\n* Chronic digestive disorder\n* Dementia\n* Endocrine diseases\n* Heart Failure\n* Immune system disorder\n* Race Black vs White\n* Ethnicity Hispanic vs non-Hispacni\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### This notebook was organized in the following structure:\n\n1.

[PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) provides annotations of biomedical concepts in PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles. Using the [PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) API, we acquired annotations for the articles in the [CORD-19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) when they are available. For those without pre-calculated annotations, we used the [PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) web interface to retrieve the annotations. All [PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) annotations were then parsed and organized in a consistent format for each article. The entities annotated by [PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) include:\n\n- Genes\n- Diseases\n- Chemicals\n- Species\n- Mutation\n- Cellline\n\nBeside [PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) annotations, we also used [BeFree](http://ibi.imim.es/befree/) and [scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) to annotate additional entities. [BeFree](http://ibi.imim.es/befree/) annotates entities of **genes** and **diseases** (a python package needs to be installed from the [BeFree repo](https://bitbucket.org/nmonath/befree/src/master/)). In order to use [BeFree](http://ibi.imim.es/befree/) in our pipeline, we modified a function of the package, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gdsttian/befree-ner-covid19).\n\n[scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) includes different models for biomedical concept annotation, among which two were used in our pipeline. The two models and the entities annotated by each model are listed as follows:\n\n- en_ner_craft_md: genes, taxonomies, sequence ontologies, chemicals, gene ontologies and cellline\n- en_ner_jnlpba_md: DNA, cell type, cellline, RNA and protein\n\nAll annotations were combined into a final set of annotations. When annotations by different tools overlap with each other, we selected the annotations with the largest span. When different tools annotate entities at the same span, we gave priority to [PubTator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/).\n\nAll codes for annotations are available through the following links:\n\n- [code for acquiring existing PubTator annotations](https://www.kaggle.com/gdsttian/entities-get-pubtator-annotation)\n- [code for posting titles abd abstracts to PubTator for annotations](https://www.kaggle.com/gdsttian/entities-post-tiabs-to-pubtator)\n- [code for retrieving completed title and abstract annotations from PubTator](https://www.kaggle.com/gdsttian/entities-retrieve-tiabs-from-pubtator)\n- [code for parsing PubTator annotations](https://www.kaggle.com/gdsttian/entities-process-pubtator-annotation)\n- [code for adding BeFree and scispacy annotations](https://www.kaggle.com/gdsttian/entities-additional-annotation)esearch/pubtator/) include:\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# !pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/nmonath/befree.git\n# !python entities_get_pubtator_annotation.py\n# !python entities_post_tiabs_to_pubtator.py\n# !python entities_retrieve_tiabs_from_pubtator.py\n# !python entities_process_pubtator_annotation.py\n# !python entities_additional_annotation.py","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Aggregation and Indexing of CORD-19 Articles\n\nWith all the CORD-19 articles processed and the annotations combined, they were aggregated into a single JSON file.

For example, whether a sentence should be an entry in the table can be determined by answering the following questions: 1. Does the sentence describe the risk factor relationship beween the risk factor term and the disease term (or severity/fatality)? 2. Does the sentence contain numerical result for such relationship? 3. Is a tagged number in the sentence the numerical result for such relationship? If the answers to the above three questions are true, then we can fill some important columns of the summary table. To answer these questions, the current question-answering systems do not work well because the answers are highly specific to the questions.\n\nTo tackle such problem, we formulated it as building machine learning models to perform classification tasks. Our current pipeline can extract sentences with both risk factor keywords (i.e. age, hypertension, etc.) and disease keywords (COVID-19, severity, mortality, etc.), which also contain numerical results in the ratio pattern. Such sentences are stored in the Sentence column in the generated dataframes. If we manually annotate the sentences based on the questions we have proposed above, then we can build machine learning models to extract the specific information required by the summary table.\n\nWe manually verified the summary tables generated by our pipeline for the following purposes:\n    1. The manually verified information can be more valuable for scientists studying COVID-19;\n    2. The manually verified data can be used as benchmark data for evaluating future studies on this type of problems;\n    3. The manually verified data can be used to build machine learning models to develop better information extraction systems.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"At the moment, we are still working on generating high quality labelled data.

One type of information we extract from sentence result is the shortest pathes between risk factor terms and disease terms. Other information can also be extracted and used in the model building process. We will first try some pre-trained deep learning models. Sentence parsing was performed using Stanford Parser. After parsing the sentence on local machine, we stored the files as json files.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Loading the json files","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import json\nimport csv\nrisk_factor_json_dir = '../input/riskfactorjson/'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Storing the files in a list and a dictionary\nfile_dic = {}\nfor fname in os.listdir(risk_factor_json_dir):\n    filename = fname.strip('json').strip('.')\n    full_fname = risk_factor_json_dir + fname    \n    files = json.load(open(full_fname, 'rb'))    \n    file_dic[filename] = files","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get the file from the dictionary\nfile_dic['Age']['0']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Getting the Shortest Paths for Risk Factors\n\n### Finding the shortest pathes in the typed dependency graph between risk factor terms and disease/severity/fatality terms","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Defining Graph data structure\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nclass Graph():\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        self.edges is a dict of all possible next nodes\n        e.g. {'X': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'E'], ...}\n        self.weights has all the weights between two nodes,\n        with the two nodes as a tuple as the key\n        e.g. {('X', 'A'): 7, ('X', 'B'): 2, ...}\n        self.dep sotres the dependency between two nodes,\n        with the two nodes as a tuple as the key\n        e.g. {('X', 'A'): 'nsubj'}\n        \"\"\"\n        self.edges = defaultdict(list)\n        self.weights = {}\n        self.dep = {}\n    \n    def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node, weight, dep):\n        # Note: assumes edges are bi-directional\n        self.edges[from_node].append(to_node)\n        self.edges[to_node].append(from_node)\n        self.weights[(from_node, to_node)] = weight\n        self.weights[(to_node, from_node)] = weight\n        self.dep[(from_node, to_node)] = dep\n        self.dep[(to_node, from_node)] = dep\n\n# Defining dijsktra to get the shortest path from initial node to target node        \ndef dijsktra(graph, initial, end):\n    # shortest paths is a dict of nodes\n    # whose value is a tuple of (previous node, weight)\n    shortest_paths = {initial: (None, 0)}\n    current_node = initial\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while current_node != end:\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        destinations = graph.edges[current_node]\n        weight_to_current_node = shortest_paths[current_node][1]\n\n        for next_node in destinations:\n            weight = graph.weights[(current_node, next_node)] + weight_to_current_node\n            if next_node not in shortest_paths:\n                shortest_paths[next_node] = (current_node, weight)\n            else:\n                current_shortest_weight = shortest_paths[next_node][1]\n                if current_shortest_weight > weight:\n                    shortest_paths[next_node] = (current_node, weight)\n        \n        next_destinations = {node: shortest_paths[node] for node in shortest_paths if node not in visited}\n        if not next_destinations:\n            return \"Route Not Possible\"\n        # next node is the destination with the lowest weight\n        current_node = min(next_destinations, key=lambda k: next_destinations[k][1])\n    \n    # Work back through destinations in shortest path\n    path = []\n    while current_node is not None:\n        path.append(current_node)\n        next_node = shortest_paths[current_node][0]\n        current_node = next_node\n    # Reverse path\n    path = path[::-1]\n    return path\n\n# Switching the order of a tuple\ndef switch(x):\n    return(x[1],x[0])\n\n# Getting the intersection of two lists\ndef intersection(lst1, lst2): \n    return list(set(lst1) & set(lst2)) \n\n# Getting the shortest path from initial node to target node, with the dependecies\ndef shortest_path(file,from_node,to_node):\n    \n    print(file['text'])\n    edges = file['edges']\n    edge_list = []\n    for idx,edge in edges.items():\n        edge_list.append((edge['target'],edge['source'],1,edge['dep']))\n        \n    g = Graph()\n    for edge in edge_list:\n        g.add_edge(*edge)\n    \n    path = dijsktra(g, from_node, to_node)\n    \n    tpl = []\n    for i in range(len(path) -
