If you are looking to contact us, here is our contact information:\n- Maria Kamali: maria.kamali@thomsonreuters.com\n- Keshav Vardachari: keshav.varadachari@thomsonreuters.com\n- Nikhil Budathoki : nbudatho@uwaterloo.ca\n\n<a id=\"task\"></a>\n# Task: \n## What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors? \n\n<a id=\"approach\"></a>\n## Purpose: \nOur platform was built based on the following principles: \n- Empower users (health researchers) to conduct literature survey efficiently. \n- Adaptable to future needs and challenges of health researchers.  \n- Modularized to have the capability of being improved and polished in a short time and in parallel.  \n\n<a id=\"hypotheses\"></a>\n## Hypotheses/why? \n\nAI can benefit researchers by extracting and visualizing information in the most efficient and relevant manner at scale.  In the absence of expert feedback and annotations, we have built/provided a platform that extracts and ranks relevant info with potential for improvement in the future by taking advantage of expert annotation. We believe that there is value in extracting excerpts that provide context on the facts presented.\n\n<a id=\"solve\"></a>\n## Our Solution \n\nThe project was done in two slightly different approaches.  \nThe first approach focused on developing an end to end pipeline to address the first subtask which was: \n- Data on potential risks factors \n- Smoking, pre-existing pulmonary disease \n- Co-infections (determine whether co-existing respiratory/viral infections make the virus more transmissible or virulent) and other co-    morbidities \n- Neonates and pregnant women \n- Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences. \n\nWe have developed a web app to visually accompany the analysis carried out for this task. You can check out the app in our project's [GitHub](https://github.com/mahtablci1/C19_txt_xtractr)\n\nThe second approach was focused on question information retrieval but isn’t accompanied by with a web-app yet due to time constraint. \n\n<a id=\"first\"></a>\n## First approach has the following recipe: \nThe platform is designed to visualize snippets of relevant topics through the following process: \n- Merge different sources of the data\n- Extract all COVID19 related papers \n- Expand and process the list of keywords\n- Find excerpts of papers that include the keywords \n- Rank the excerpts\n- Create an extractive summary for each paper\n- Serve it to the web-app for visualization\n\n### The platform is running and live. You can check it out [here](https://nikhilbudathoki.github.io/react-viz/)\n\nHere is a screenshot of our platform:\n![Demo](https://github.com/mahtablci1/Kaggle/blob/master/platform_sample.png?raw=true)\n\n<a id=\"second\"></a>\n## Second approach has the following recipe: \nThe platform is designed to rank snippets of relevant topics through the following process: \n\n- Merge different sources of the data\n- Extract all COVID 19 related paper s\n- Convert a question into set of keywords (The questions are extracted from the [medical dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NoiAFJoydk3zuc-G0qqROarkhaGpfgbQhTVYhbYtLCM/edit#gid=0) shared with Kaggle participants.\n- Expand the list of keywords\n- Find excerpts of papers that include the keywords \n- Rank the excerpts\n- Create an extractive summary for each paper\n\n\n<a id=\"pros\"></a>\n\n### Pros and Cons of our approach and platform: \n\n#### Pros: \n\n- The code base is highly modular and simple.    \n- The code is very well documented \n- The visualization resonates with researchers. We interviewed an expert in epidemiology, since that is our target user. He liked all  aspects of it including the extractive summaries of the papers. He also noted that using this platform could reduce the time taken for a literature survey, which normally takes 3 to 4 months, to less than a month.  \n- The platform is taking a high recall approach(keyword search). It sets a well structured baseline to build and expand on. \n- The platform also includes extractive sumamries(SciBert) for each paper. Researchers can go through the article in a fraction of the time it would take to read the full paper.\n- With a little bit of effort, we can convert this platform to an expert annotation platform where experts can interactively click on relevant sentences in the snippets to convert a completely unsupervised approach to a supervised learning task. \n\n#### Cons: \n- The output wasn't reviewed and validated by a subject matter expert\n- Keyword search is not the most efficient search. Word embedding is known to be a better approach for text analysis but there wasn’t enough time to implement and evaluate that. \n- Our ranking follows a simple approach, where an expert should decide on the metric for ranking the importance of a snippet. \n- The second approach is not coming with a visualization. \n- There may be more risk factors than what we currently searched for and an algorithm should extract the unknown risks too. \n- The platform should ideally allow users to query articles questions; the implementation for which is not yet complete."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ackn\"></a>\n### Acknowledgement\nWe would like to thank Brian Romer (https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianromer/) for his valuable help in designing the visualization as well as Serge Myroshnychenko (https://www.linkedin.com/in/smyroshnychenko/) for his valuable feedback on the interface."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"code\"></a>\n# Code"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Requirements"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport io\nimport re\nimport sys\nimport glob\nimport json\nimport string\nimport requests\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize\n\nstemmer = PorterStemmer()\nroot = '../input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'\nstop_words = list(set(stopwords.words('english')))\nstop_words.extend(['within', 'what', 'how', 'eg', 'ie'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Parsing and Extraction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### `PaperLoader` class will load all papers for the challenge and provide an interface for us to obtain `DataFrames` to work with.
