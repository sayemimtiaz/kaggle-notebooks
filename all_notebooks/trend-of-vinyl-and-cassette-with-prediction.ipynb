Conclusion\n\nBy looking into the visualization and outcome from the analysis, here are viewpoints as below. \n\n1. Although the released number of vinyl and cassette records went down from 2000 to 2010, the number of these records went up from 2010 until now. \n2. There is a high correlation between vinyl records and cassette records. When considering issuing products, such as turntables, for vinyl records, it makes sense to evaluate whether issuing products, such as a boombox, for cassette records is needed.\n3. From the charts with polynomial regression lines, the number of vinyl and cassette records will increase. This is a trend that we can think about the market demand.\n\nSuggested further analysis.\n\n1. What the music genres of these records are?\n2. Comparing the sales of turntables and cassette players to see whether there is a correlation between released vinyl and cassette records.\n3. The market trend of digital music sales and physical records sales.","metadata":{}}]}
