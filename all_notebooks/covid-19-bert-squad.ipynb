What have we learned from epidemiological studies?\". A set of questions were raised in the challenge outline and we set out to find the asnwers to those questions using data analysis. We did not want to lose the focus on what was asked and decided for a clean simple yet very effective approach.\n\n### 1.2 THE APPROACH\n\nOur approach is based on selective models benchmarked in reference to the provided dataset in order to maximise the answering power and keep the results tied to the scope of the challenge. After reviewing a series of references referring to cuttin-edge methods in the field, we compared benchmarks in various papers and decided to find the best BERT model for this purpose. We tried several models, found the best results using a specific BERT model fine tuned for questions-answers.\n\nOther submissions picked this model, but the peculiarity that we found extremely effective was that the other solutions did not apply extensively the model, in particular decided to first filte the papers database by searching keywords and strings, and only apply BERT to find the answer in the reulting filtered data. Our approach flips this logic upside down, since we first identify the best answers across all papers database, and only after filter by keyword where needed.\n\n### 1.3 THE RESULTS\nOur results provide satisfying answers for 7 out of 8 questions. The time taken to extract an answer is reduced to a less than 30 seconds per question on a faster machine but we decided to pre-calculate them because of the limited power available on Kaggle notebooks. The summary of the results - which can be found in extended form in the relative section - follow:\n\n<table width=\"100%\">\n    <thead>\n    <tr>\n        <td width=\"30%\"  style=\"text-align:left\"> Question </td>\n        <td  style=\"text-align:left\"> Answer </td>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Risk factors: Smoking, pre-existing pulmonary disease. </td> \n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Very likely but not demonstrated. It was demonstrated that smoking has no clinical or preventive significance for risk of influenza in the elderly. However, asthma is to be considered a risk factor for rhinovirus, which in turn often exaplains more underlying pulmonary illness. </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Risk factors: Co-infections (determine whether co-existing respiratory/viral infections make the virus more transmissible or virulent) and other co-morbidities. </td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Likely not. It was observed that very often infected individuals with The COVID-19 coronavirus but without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others . However, for pneumonia in relation to viruses similar to Covid-19, i.e. HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1, it was observed that co-infections caused significantly higher rates of breathing difficulties, cough, and sore throat than those of single infections. </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Neonates and pregnant women. </td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Likely. While multiple studies demonstrated that pregnant women are more likely to develop severe illness after infection with Covid-19 and other influenza viruses, there is no study demonstrating that Covid-19 poses higher risk for neonates. However, neonates are thought to be susceptible to the virus, because their immune system is not well developed. </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences. </td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Likely but not demonstrated. While no study looked directly at socio-economic and behavioral factors in relation to Covid-19, previous studies focused on risk factors for population from poorer areas of the World, identifying different health risks when compared to local population - such as other infectious diseases, inadequate immunity to vaccine-preventable illnesses, higher likelihood of having malnutrition and developmental delay and psychological trauma. </td>\n    </tr> \n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Transmission dynamics of the virus, including the basic reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, modes of transmission and environmental factors. </td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Covid-19 is spread by human-to-human transmission via direct contact, droplets and aerosol transmissions, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24–3.58. With regards to enviromental factors, tests on virus surrogaes for Covid demonstrated that low air temperature and low humidity are likely to increase virus survival on surfaces up to 28 days, with studies going as far as suggesting hospitals to keep high temperatures at relatively high RH to reduce the survival of airborne influenza virus. It is also demonstrated that an enviroment that allows for substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of COVID-19, while after travel restrictions and control measures are imposed the reproductive number number falls considerably. Also, testing strategies that do not produce repeated false-negatives as the existing test do are deemed beneficial for the containment of the virus. </td>\n    </tr> \n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Severity of disease, including risk of fatality among symptomatic hospitalized patients, and high-risk patient groups. </td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> The risk of fatality among infected individuals is 0.3% to 0.6%, but among hospitalised cases this increases to 14%. Based on deaths reported, high risk groups are pregnant women, older than the general population (mean age 45),and people in hospices. </td>\n    </tr> \n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Susceptibility of populations. </td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Unkonwn </td>\n    </tr> \n        <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control. </td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:left\"> Although little data is available for Covid-19 control measures, based on a forecasting model on Covid-19 data, it has been showed to be effective closin borders, schools, and suspending community services and commuters. More in general, in a number of recent studies, it has been shown how different intervention measures like travel restrictions, school closures, treatment and prophylaxis might allow to control outbreaks of diseases, such as SARS, pandemic influenza and others. It is also worth noting that because the elevated death risk estimates from Covid-19 are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.  </td>\n    </tr> \n       \n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n# 2.

The code is simple, the results are surfaced and can be used easily even by non-experts without too much effort.\n\nThere are a few gaps in the answers - in particular to susceptible population - this is an interesting point about data gaps because we do know there are publications out there addressing this questions (e.g. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841120300469 ) but they are not in the database and therefore the algorithm did not surface them. Also, a lot of the data is unstructured and not parsed - in particular in the full text form.\n\nAlso, the database is very heterogenous and the results are often relative to old research or other viruses or outbreaks - rhinovirus, Sars etc - presenting the risk of oversimplification and generalization of the findings that the careful reader can identify when looking at the best set of results, but the models (not ours, all of those that we checked) will struggle to grasp. This could lead to really dangerous results and therefore we do think this tools should be used just to rank the findings and surface the possible answers and then - as demonstrated in the Summary above - it'd be very simple for a reader to pick the best answer. This is often based on the full abstract, the title and the year of publication, so we included those elements (as well as a link to the full text) in our results output.\n\nIn terms of models parameters - different scoring methods affect the results of the model. Therefore, we assessed the scores and compared results using two different scoring methods - first using only the starting token score, and then using a composite score based on both start and end tokens. An exemplificative set of tokens scores for the first question is showed in the figures below - we found that by taking the highest scores in a 40 tokens range around the start (green spike in the first figure below) and end (green spike in the second figure below) token gives the best answers, so we implemented that in the question/answer model."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def start_word_plot(token_labels, s_scores):\n  ax = sns.barplot(x=token_labels, y=s_scores, ci=None)\n  ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=90, ha=\"center\")\n  ax.grid(True)\n  plt.title('Start Word Scores [for first answer]')\n  plt.show()\n\ndef end_word_plot(token_labels,e_scores):\n  ax = sns.barplot(x=token_labels, y=e_scores, ci=None)\n  ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=90, ha=\"center\")\n  ax.grid(True)\n  plt.title('End Word Scores [for first answer]')\n  plt.show()\n\ndf = load_or_run_answer_question_dict(questions[0]['question'], question['keyword'])\nstart_word_plot(df.iloc[0]['token_labels'],df.iloc[0]['s_scores'])\nend_word_plot(df.iloc[0]['token_labels'],df.iloc[0]['e_scores'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.3 Pros and cons and future work\n\nWe think that our model is accurate and can surface the best answers.
