All models had used independent variables which undergo PCA to condense the independent variables. Without apply PCA, the models were all providing a 100% accuracy rate. Thus, it was necessary to apply PCA although it creates a small loss in information. \n\nIt is appropriate to compare these three models together as they had all used the same transformed data to model. From the accuracy score above, the KNN models have the highest score. In addition, there were no overfitting on the training data for this model. Therefore, this is the best model among the three models.\n\nNote that although the model results are good, there are a few limitations that should be kept in mind. A major limitation of the models is that they are 'idealizations' or 'simplification' of reality. We may be able to use it to predict reality but there is always a possibility of error in the prediction. Each prediction comes with a set of assumptions which are made during modeling and this causes differences between model and reality. In this project, PCA with 2 number of components were used. If the number of component changed or MCA was used instead of PCA, the best model might not be KNN any longer. Or if we had changed the depth or the number of neighbors to some other values, it will have an impact on the generated model results.","metadata":{}}]}
