The price of the apartment(per day)\n* minimum_nights - The least nights you need to book\n* numberofreviews - The total number of the reviews on this dataset\n* last_review - The last review time\n* reviewspermonth - How many reviews the airbnb can receive per month\n* calculatedhostlistings_count - The total listing number of the host\n* availability_365 - The available days\n\nI'm going to do some plots based on the dataset to see questions like:\n* Which neighborhood is the most popular neighborhood on Airbnb?\n* What kind of room type people resevered most?\n* What is the price range of airbnb in different neighborhood?\n\nAlso will include:\n* line, bar plot\n* interactive scatter plot\n* map and interactive map\n* joyplot"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install chart_studio","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install joypy","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport pandas.util.testing as tm\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport os \nimport folium\nfrom folium import plugins\nimport rasterio as rio\nfrom rasterio.warp import calculate_default_transform, reproject, Resampling\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport plotly.tools as tl\nimport chart_studio.plotly as py\nimport chart_studio\nimport os\nimport tarfile\nfrom six.moves import urllib\nfrom bokeh.io import output_file, output_notebook, show\nfrom bokeh.models import (\n  GeoJSONDataSource, GMapOptions, GMapPlot, ColumnDataSource, Circle,CircleX,Hex, Square, Patches, LabelSet, HoverTool,Legend, LegendItem, Plot, LinearAxis, Grid, LogColorMapper, LinearColorMapper, ColorBar, BasicTicker,\n  TapTool,Range1d, PanTool, WheelZoomTool, BoxSelectTool,OpenURL, ZoomInTool, ZoomOutTool, Arrow, OpenHead, NormalHead, VeeHead, LabelSet, Label\n)\nfrom bokeh.models.mappers import ColorMapper, LinearColorMapper\nfrom bokeh.palettes import Viridis5\nimport plotly_express as px","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import Dataset and pre-processing\n>>\nI'm going to\n>>\n* remove NaN column\n* replace NaN data\n* remove outliers"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('../input/chicago-airbnb-open-data/listings.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Data shape',df.shape)\ndf.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe().transpose()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":">>\nHere has a whole columns is NaN, I will remove it, \n>>\nAlso replace all the NaN data to 0"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=df.drop(columns=['neighbourhood_group'])\ndf = df.fillna(0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":">>\nChecking the outliers:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.sort_values(by=['price'],ascending=False).head(60)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":">>\n### price\n>>\nAlthough there will be some hotel or house super expensive, but the price over 7000 dollars for a private room still seems abnoraml, so I will remove it.
