Today we’re going to do two things:\n\n1. Get our code ready to be served through an app\n2. Write a Flask app (well, most of one)\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n# Get your modelling code ready to be put in an app\n\nSince you spent some time thinking about your app yesterday, you hopefully have a pretty good idea what you want your Python code to do. Today we’re going to follow a three-step model of development. \n\n* **Make it work**. The first thing you want to do is get your code doing whatever it is that you intend for it to do. It doesn’t have to be beautiful or perfectly optimized (you can always go back and refector it later), it just needs to work.\n* **Make it pretty**. At this stage, you can spend some time tidying up your code. Adding comments, creating functions for particular tasks, making sure your variable names are informative; things that will make it easier for other people to read and use your code.\n* **Make it portable**. Finally, you want to make your code portable. This includes saving out your model so that you can load it into a new session and use it to make predictions.\n\nLet’s see an example of what this process looks like. \n\n## Make it work\n\nFirst, I wrote a quick script that gets all instances of Python package names & their indexes from some sample text. The general workflow is: \n\n1. Get a list of Python packages (from [this list](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/) helpful maintained by [hugovk on GitHub](https://github.com/hugovk)). \n2. Use that list to create a flashtext KeywordProcessor object. This object will let us use flashtext to find our terms. **Flashtext can be more than 20 times faster than using regular expressions to extract a list of keywords** and you also don't have to write any Perl. You can find more information about the package [here](https://flashtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n3. Remove common English words and words that are used often on the Kaggle forums, since these are unlikely to be referring to a specific Python package. ([Even though there is a Python package called \"the\"](https://pypi.org/project/the/) and people write \"the\" very often in the forums, they're never actually talking about the package called \"the\".)\n4. Put our KeywordProcessor into action and see if it works!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nfrom flashtext.keyword import KeywordProcessor\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\n# let's read in a couple of forum posts\nforum_posts = pd.read_csv(\"../input/ForumMessages.csv\")\n\n# get a smaller sub-set for playing around with\nsample_posts = forum_posts.Message[0:3]\n\n# get data from list of top 5000 pypi packages (last 30 days)\nurl = 'https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/top-pypi-packages-30-days.json'\ndata = requests.get(url).json()\n\n# get just the list of package names\nlist_of_packages = [data_item['project'] for data_item in data['rows']]\n\n# create a KeywordProcess\nkeyword_processor = KeywordProcessor()\nkeyword_processor.add_keywords_from_list(list_of_packages)\n\n# remove english stopwords\nkeyword_processor.remove_keywords_from_list(stopwords.words('english'))\n\n# remove custom stopwords\nkeyword_processor.remove_keywords_from_list(['http','kaggle'])\n\n# test our keyword processor\nfor post in sample_posts:\n    keywords_found = keyword_processor.extract_keywords(post, span_info=True)\n    print(keywords_found)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Yay, it works!

So, I want to create functions that will let me do this. I broke my code into two functions. \n\n* One function does what I want my app to do: takes in a pre-trained model (here our word processor) and then applies it\n* The other creates a keyword model, automating the preprocessing we did. That way if we want to create a new keyword processor with different words in the future we can easily do that.\n\nWith a little refactoring, my code now looks like this:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# I'm not going to read in the packages & data again since it's \n# already in our current environment.\n\ndef create_keywordProcessor(list_of_terms, remove_stopwords=True, \n                            custom_stopword_list=[\"\"]):\n    \"\"\" Creates a new flashtext KeywordProcessor and opetionally \n    does some lightweight text cleaning to remove stopwords, including\n    any provided by the user.\n    \"\"\"\n    # create a KeywordProcessor\n    keyword_processor = KeywordProcessor()\n    keyword_processor.add_keywords_from_list(list_of_terms)\n\n    # remove English stopwords if requested\n    if remove_stopwords == True:\n        keyword_processor.remove_keywords_from_list(stopwords.words('english'))\n\n    # remove custom stopwords\n    keyword_processor.remove_keywords_from_list(custom_stopword_list)\n    \n    return(keyword_processor)\n\ndef apply_keywordProcessor(keywordProcessor, text, span_info=True):\n    \"\"\" Applies an existing keywordProcessor to a given piece of text. \n    Will return spans by default. \n    \"\"\"\n    keywords_found = keywordProcessor.extract_keywords(text, span_info=span_info)\n    return(keywords_found)\n    \n\n# create a keywordProcessor of python packages    \npy_package_keywordProcessor = create_keywordProcessor(list_of_packages, \n                                                      custom_stopword_list=[\"kaggle\", \"http\"])\n\n# apply it to some sample posts (with apply_keywordProcessor function, omitting\n# span information)\nfor post in sample_posts:\n    text = apply_keywordProcessor(py_package_keywordProcessor, post, span_info=False)\n    print(text)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Make it portable\n\nSo far, we've gotten our code working and have refactored it so that it's more modular and other people trying to use it will be able to follow it more easily. But how can we take a model we've trained in one place and apply it in another? By saving the model and then loading it into a new environment. \n\n> In general, ML APIs are used for inference. In other words, you have a pre-trained model that is applied to the data that is sent to it. You could create an API that trains models, but you will probably have to end up having to pay for the compute used to train those models. This can become expensive. Particularly since I'm not covering how to do authentication, which means anyone would be able to train as many models as they wanted with your API, **I'd recommend avoiding including model training in your API.** I'm assuming going forward that your API will use a pretrained model.\n\nSo how do you save a model and then read it back into Python? It depends on the specific type of model you're training. \n\n### Library-specific methods for saving models\n\nIf the library you used to train your model has a specific set of methods to save and load model file, then I'd recommend using them. Here are the methods for some popular machine learning libraries.\n\n* For *TensorFlow* and *Keras*, you can save models using `model.save_weights()` and read it in using `model.load_weights()`. By default, your model will be saved as a HDF5 file. You can find [more information on tf here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_restore_models#manually_save_weights) and [more on Keras here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html). .\n* For *PyTorch* you can use `torch.save()` and `torch.load()`. PyTorch saves models as pickles. [More info here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html). \n* For *XGBoost*, you can save models with `model.dump_model()` and load them with `model.load_model()`. [More info here](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html#training).\n* For *LightGBM*, you can use `model_to_string()` and `model_from_string()`. [More info here](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-API.html#lightgbm.Booster.model_from_string). \n\n### If there's no library-specific technique\n\nIf the library you're using doesn't have a specific method for saving out models, probably the easiest choice is to save your model as a pickle. [Pickles are a serialized data format for Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html), which means you can read them directly into your current environment as variables. If your model is built as one or more numpy arrays, [you may be able to use HDF5 instead](https://www.christopherlovell.co.uk/blog/2016/04/27/h5py-intro.html), but pickles can handle more different data structures.\n\n**🥒 A quick warning about pickles 🥒** You should be aware that if there are differences between the version or subversion of Python you used to pickle your model and the one you try to unpickle it with, you model can fail to load. (This is also true of packages with different versions!) To avoid this, you can specify the specific versions of Python and each package you used when you create your app in your requirements file. \n\n**🥒🥒 A second quick warning about pickles 🥒🥒** While they can be useful for moving Python objects around, it’s also not a very secure file format. [As the Python wiki puts it:](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle) “Pickle files can be hacked. If you receive a raw pickle file over the network, don't trust it! It could have malicious code in it, that would run arbitrary python when you try to de-pickle it.”\n\nIn this case, the Flashtext module doesn’t have a native way to save a load objects (at least that I can find), so I’ll save my keyword processor as a pickle using the pickle library. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pickle\n\n# save our file (make sure our file permissions are \"wb\", \n# which will let us _w_rite a _b_inary file)\npickle.dump(py_package_keywordProcessor, open(\"processor.pkl\", \"wb\"))\n\n# check our current directory to make sure it saved\n!ls","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From here, we can load our model back in, assign it to a variable and apply it right away. \n\n> **How can I download my trained model from this notebook?** Right now, once you've saved a file, the easiest way to download it is to commit your notebook.

For example, you may need to crop or resize images so that they fit the pixel dimensions that your model expects. \n\nSince we’re using a trained model we don’t actually need to put any of the code or data we used to train it into our app. We can just use our model and the function that applies it. \n\n## Your turn\n\n**Make it work!** Don’t worry about getting too fancy, just get your code working.
