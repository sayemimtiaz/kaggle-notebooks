Ofcourse some other categories can come into the story, but I think these should be the main aspect. Same metrics that apply for the countries of the world apply for US States (the first analysis) BUT when we collected these measuraments for the countries of the world a strange pattern emerged: Sweden, German etc were on top of the list. And to quote myself as I said (underneath when second question was answered)\n\n\"WHAT? It does not make any sence. Sweden? It is because people have more trust, less corruption, better reporting system punishments etc... IN ORDER To mitigate this effect and get the TRUE levels we ought to normalise these values with all of the values/data that I just named, and even more since these are just some of the factors that influence the odd results. That implies finding ALL of these datasets that coincide with ALL of the countries on ALL of the years. \"\n\nSo we searched for some indicators that could remove this effect and we found \"Rule of law\" and \"Corruption index\" (its underneath when reading in the crime data for the entire world). And we did find that this approach paints a better picture of a crime rate of  a country.

One of them would be why was crime in NYC in 90-s so high? Well there seems to be a couple of factors (we state them, not test them) For example, the police force in New York City grew by 35 percent in the 1990s, the numbers of prison inmates rose 24 percent, and there were demographic changes, including a decline in the number of youths. The national unemployment rate declined 25 percent between 1990 and 1999, and by 39 percent in the city between 1992 and 1999. This study shows that a single percentage point decline in the jobless rate decreases burglary by 2.2 percent and motor vehicle theft by 1.8 percent. Increases in the real minimum wage also significantly reduce robberies and murders: 3.4 to 3.7 percent fewer robberies with a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage and 6.3 to 6.9 percent fewer murders. And ofcourse police measures.The police measure that most consistently reduces crime is the arrest rate of those involved in crime, the study finds. Felony arrest rates (except for motor vehicle thefts) rose 50 to 70 percent in the 1990s. When arrests of burglars increased 10 percent, the number of burglaries fell 2.7 to 3.2 percent. When the arrest rate of robbers rose 10 percent, the number of robberies fell 5.7 to 5.9 percent. In the case of murder, the decline was 3.9 to 4 percent; in the case of assault, 2 to 2.4 percent; and for motor vehicle theft, 5 to 5.1 percent.
