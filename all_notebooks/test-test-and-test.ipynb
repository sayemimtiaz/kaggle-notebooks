Their labs were preparing testing kits as far back as in early Jan [link to news article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/europe/coronavirus-testing-world-countries-cities-states.html)  Countries like Taiwan had prepared for testing and contact tracing.  The national government ordered protective equipment and distributed it to hospitals. \n\nPlease also read Nate Silver's critique on how the [number of case counts is meaningless](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/) unless it's correlated with the testing strategy. \n\n\n1. Iceland is a large outlier in terms of aggressive testing, having conducted more than 45k+ tests/ million. But, they have a relatively high level of disease infection, calculated as 2,981 cases/million.  They performed 15 tests for every positive case that they find.  They are testing a lot, but they also have a fair amount of disease prevalence so the aggressive testing may be appropriate.\n\n2. By comparison, United Arab Emirates (UAE) performs 385 tests to find one positive case, but they have a very low level of infection, 59 positive cases/million.  They are testing very aggressively and compared to the Disease Prevalence,  UAE is over-testing.\n\n4. South Korea (ROK) has an intermediate level of tests done/positive tests, they perform 42 tests to find one positive  case.  ROK had an outbreak of Covid-19 similar to Wuhan, China but controlled the spread of disease by implemnting aggresive public health measures.  For ROK, Tests Done/Positive test = 410564/9786 = 41.95 =42   Similarly for Singapore, Tests Done/Positive Test = 70.  Let's call Tests Done/Positive Test the \"Testing Ratio\".\n\n5. Italy has high prevalence of disease and relatively low tests done/positive tests.  In general Italy, Spain, UK, New York, New Jersey appear to have similar high levels of disease and low Testing Ratios.  For example, New York has  a Testing Ratio of 3 and a Disease Prevalence of 3,418 positive cases/million population. New York performs only 3 tests to find one positive case.  Compare this to the UAE who performs 385 tests to find one positive case!\n\n6. Countries with a history of experience of surviving large outbreaks of SARS in 2003 have dealt with the pandemic successfully.  These include China, Hongkong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Canada. SARS 2003 was less contagious than Covid-19 and had higher mortaility rate.  Both SARS and Covid-19 infected healthcare workers at an increased rate.  A recent article out of Taiwan suggests the Covid 19 virus is transmissable ealier in the infected person whereas SARS spread only after the onset of symptoms.  Social Network Analysis of SARS shows that Hospitals were hubs of transmission.  Regions that had previously experienced the SARS epidemic tested aggresively, have moderately high Testing Ratios and have relatively low levle of infection in their region.  This combination of adequate or aggressive testing combined with aggresive public health measures likely allowed them to control of the advance of the pandemic.\n\n8. Greenland is one of the least densely populated countries on earth, similar to the Sahara in Africa.  It small population (54,000) and has a relatively low level of infection.  Greenland has 11 cases or 204 cases/million.  Iceland is very tiny island compared to Greenland and is geographically located just below Greenland.  Iceland tested vigorously and Iceland has 2,981 cases/million. (Population of Greenland is about 54,000 or about 1/7th of Iceland's 360,000).
