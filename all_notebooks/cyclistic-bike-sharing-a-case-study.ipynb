The company currently has three distinct pricing plans: **single-ride passes**, **full-day passes**, and **annual memberships**. Their conclusion is that, financially speaking, 'annual members' are much more profitable than 'casual riders' - as they classify their customers. \n##### The idea behind this study is to analyze Cyclistic's user data and identify how customers behave differently, coming up with insights that could help convert 'casual riders' into 'annual members'.\n\n---\n\n##### The data analysis process consists of 6 key steps, them being: `Ask`, `Prepare`, `Process`, `Analyze`, `Share` and `Act`.\n##### Each step and relevant finding is going to be documented. At the end, I am going to share at least **three key insights** to help achieve the business goal.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Ask\n#### At this point, it is important to have a clear understanding of what the business task is and what steps we plan to take to successfully tackle it. \n* The purpose of this analysis has already been clearly defined: **improve revenue by converting 'casual riders' into 'annual members'**.

There could be strategies for both personas.\n* **Annual** members not necessary prefer one type of bike over the other - even though they, in general, use more of the classic bikes, it may only be due to availability. Because of their steady usage on working days and the peak around the end of business hours, they probably make the most use of our services to move to and from their working place. As a result of their annual membership, they probably use the bikes for shorter distances, which would reasonably explain the difference in the duration of their trips. \n\n2. **Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**\n* Two main pieces of data, which are missing, could contribute to tackle this question: out of the docked bikes, which are electric and which are 'classic'? A higher availability of electric bikes in the busiest stations for casual customers could drive their usage up. Also, financial information could help emphasize the benefits of being an annual member. For those casual clients who use the bikes with a certain frequency, highlighting the cost-benefit of being an annual member might make them consider becoming one.\n\n3. **How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**\n* The brand could try to drive up engagement by making posts related to leisure (especially closer to the weekend) and the benefits of using riding a bicycle on a daily basis - these could be related to the environment (less cars on the street), physical and mental health (avoid traffic, exercising, etc.)\n* Mentioning the benefits of being an annual member should also be effective.\n\n### *<ins>Recommendations</ins>* (top three):\n##### 1. Use social media and e-mail marketing to engane with casual customers. Emphasize the benefits of being an annual member, which they may not be acquainted with yet. \n##### 1.1 Give a special discount valid for working days for those who use frequently the services only on weekends. The percentage of this discount may gradually decrease throughout the day - which would mean that the earlier they used their coupon, the higher the percentage would be. This may lead them to use it early in the morning, which is currently their bottom in daily usage.<br>\n##### 2. Ensure availability of electric bikes on the most popular stations.<br> \n##### 3. Place 'out of home' ads near these stations and on their most frequent routes, especially in the city centre and close to tourist attractions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Thank you for reading!\n##### You can find me on:\n* [Github](https://github.com/yncosta)\n* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yanscosta)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanphcosta/)","metadata":{}}]}
