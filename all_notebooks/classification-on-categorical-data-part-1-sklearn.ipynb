We picked those models because they are fast to train. We will use `RandomizedSearchCV` to choose hyperparameters from the same parameter grid for both plan A and plan B. After that, we will compare the results of them.\n\nTutorial for `RandomizedSearchCV` can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_randomized_search.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-randomized-search-py). We also borrowed Rupanjan Nayak's [code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23045318/scikit-grid-search-over-multiple-classifiers) to train multiper models at once.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Plan A**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Classifiers:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"logreg_clf =

set a threshold that only those features whose importance is higher than 0.015 can be in this plot. For data A and C, the feature importance plots are basically the same, and the cluster labels we added by kprototypes clustering does not show up in the feature importance plot which means it is not that important at least in Random Forest model. If we check the top 10 most important features, they are coupon type and occupation type's target and frequency encoding, how frequent to go to coffee houses, education and time's target encoding, income, and age.\n\nFor data B, we can see that the frequency features: CoffeeHouse, Bar, CarryAway, RestaurantLessThan20, and Restaurant20To50 are on the upper part of the plot, indicating their importances. Numerical features like income, age, temperature, and distance are quite importance as well as the Education level. Coupon features like coupon type and coupon expiration time are also in the plot. Indeed, there are some similarity between data in B and A, C.

Finally we reached 76.3% accuracy on test data with Gaussian RBF SVM.\n\nThe main focus of this notebook is to show various kinds of feature engineering methods applicable on categorical data and the sklearn style workflow to train multiple models at once. For categorical data encoding, we tried one hot encoding, target encoding, and frequency encoding. We also explored one of the feature expansion methods that is suitable for mixed data type: kprototypes clustering. \n\nIn the next part, we will train GPU supported models like Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting Machines, tune the hyperparamters with Optuna, stack models to get a better predictive performance, and finally try the autoML tools.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
