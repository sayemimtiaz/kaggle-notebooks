What is a Time-Series anyway?**\n                                            \nA time-series is very simple information : Data measured against points in time. The resolution can be minutes like in weather, it can be in days like in the closing market value of a stock, it can be in months like in airline monthly ridership, it can be in years like in annual GDP of a country. \n\nTime-series forecasting is exactly what it sounds like - predicting future values in time. Developing a  forecasting model depends on the forecasting horizon. Very short-term forcasting would typically involve predicting the value at the next minute or hour, short-term forecasting has a horizon of days or weeks, long-term forecasting is done for months or a year or two, and we also have very-long term forecasting that could easily have a horizon of up to a few decades.\n\nHere, we will build a simple Deep Learning based very-short-term Time-series forcaster, that will predict the stock prices of Bitcoin. \n\nI will also try to write code that is as generic as possible, so that it can be easily replicated to do time-series forecasting for a wide range of datasets and scenarios."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**1.3.

Finding Regressor Inputs**\n\nThere are many time-series forcasting techinques. First, there are the conventional statistical techniques like ARIMA, and exponential smoothing. Then there are other traditional approaches like Regression. Neural Networks have been popular in forecasting problems because of their ability to make predictions on non-linear complex data. Conventional statistical techniques don't work well with highly non-linear data. Multi-dimensional linear Regression has shown good results too on complex non-linear data (don't let the \"linear\" in it confuse you, it refers to the linear combination of input variables, the input variables themselves however can be expressed as higher degree polynomaials in the function that we are trying to model)\n\nBut we will do our predciting using a Neural Network. There are two basic paths to implement a model.\n\nSome implement by considering the historical values of the very series they are trying to predict as the input regressors (variables). This approach assumes that the future values can be expressed as a fuction of the past values. The two things to determine are - which past values to use (how far back into the past we need to look), and the parameters of the function itself\n\nMany times, we also include input variables that are of very different nature than the time-series under observation. For example, in Electrical load forecating the weather time series (temperature) is used as one of the input variables. It makes sense since in most regions of our planet, temperature does affect the electrical power consumption. A drop in the temperate regions would have people using more of their heaters, and in sub-tropical or tropical regions, a rise in temperatue typically drives the air-conditioning load.\n\nOkay.

It drops a certain percentage (20% in our case) of the links randomly, that are connected to the output node.

We go through many epochs.\n\nBut how many epochs do we have to go through, you ask? You already might have guessed. When we get the feel that out neural network model has captured the patterns in the data and is in a position to make predictions. How do we ensure that?\n\nWhat we do is hold out a few samples of data as a validation set. We don't use them for training (i.e for updating the weights). We only run the validation set after every epoch, and check the error. We also keep a track of the training error but it's not as important as validation error since the training error is what adjusts the weights. So, in a sense the training data is what the network soaks in. The validation data is something it doesn't soak in. As we keep checking the errors, only when the validation error has come down to near the training error, we stop further training.\n\nThere are many ways to calcualte error.

That could be mean squared error, or mean average error etc.\n\nWe could also use use something called as r_squared (or r2) score. Just remember that like Regression, it measures the squared mean distance between true values and values lying the predictor hyperplane (our predicted values), and spits out a score between 0 and 1.
