Overview:\n\n<em style='color: red'>Blood pressure (BP)</em>, also referred to as <em style='color: red'>Arterial blood pressure (ABP)</em>, is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels.\n\n\nThe most common approach to measure Blood Pressure (BP) without clinical supervision is the automated BP cuff employing oscillometry. A cuff is wrapped around the upper arm and inflated above systolic pressure, then deflated to a pressure below diastolic BP. A pressure sensor inserted in the cuff records the arterial pulsations during the cuff deflation, and the amplitudes of these pulsations are used to calculate systolic and diastolic BP. \n\n<div><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Blood_pressure_monitoring.jpg/1920px-Blood_pressure_monitoring.jpg\", height=\"100\", width=\"500\"/></div>\n\n\nThis approach has many limitations, the primary one being that it relies on a set of empirical coefficients to map the pulse amplitudes to systolic and diastolic BP. Most of these coefficients are specific to the device and can vary across devices. \n\nFurther, since it relies solely on pulse amplitudes, <strong> it fails to provide accurate readings in patients with atherosclerosis or obese patients whose pulse amplitudes can be weak</strong>.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"AksryQ8vf9f8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**ElectroCardiogram (ECG)**\n\nECG or EKG check for signs of heart disease.
