CFPB also is responsible for enforcing financial regulations. Therefore consumer complaints hold useful information both for CFPB and the customers they serve. In the following sections we connect to the complaints data and do an exploratory analysis of the narratives provided by customers. \n\nAlong the way we'll highlight areas that may be useful to CFPB, both in educating & empowering consumers within its Division of Consumer Education and Engagement and Division of Research Markets and Regulation. \n\n\n## Getting the Data\n\nAfter importing each package, we'll query the consumer compaints database provided by CFPB by\n\n1. Connecting to the database file\n2. Creating a cursor for the connection\n3. Creating and execute a SQL query, saving the results to the 'complaints' variable\n4.

For each narrative we want two pieces of information\n\n1. What words appear, and\n2. How many times each of the words appears\n\nAn efficient way to do this is with a Document Term Matrix (DTM) and Vocabulary. The DTM has a row for each mortgage complaint narrative and a column for each word in the vocabulary, resulting in an MxN matrix, where M is the number of complaints and N is the number of words in the vocabulary. The *ijth* entry corresponds to the count of the *jth* vocabulary word in *the ith* narrative. \n\nThat may seem a bit abstract if you're unfamiliar with text analysis and/or linear algebra, but the basic concept -- counting word occurrences -- is in fact quite simple.

Once we have a vocabulary we'll count up how many times each narrative uses each word in the vocabulary. Those counts will make up the DTM.\n\nThe big idea behind creating a DTM is that each document -- in our case mortgage complaint narratives -- can be represented as a vector. Using vectors we can compute things like distance and similarity between narratives. \n\nBut some words -- like 'the', 'a', 'it' -- occur so frequently in English text they'll be in nearly 100% of the narratives and therefore don't add much value to our DTM. Think of it like this -- if I tell you two narratives use the word 'the' and 'it' five times you likely haven't learned anything about their content, but if I tell you two narratives contain the words 'refinance' and 'foreclosure' 5 times you can begin to make some inferences about what other words they include. \n\nIn text analysis, these frequently occuring terms are known as 'stop words'. There's a dictionary of them in the nltk package but we'll also include some words from the text reading the example narrative above we don't want in the vocabulary.

When complaints are filed the most similar complaint -- or even the 10 most similar complaints -- could be used for outreach and connecting consumers. When filing a complaint you're probably interested in how similar complaints were resolved. \n\n2. Clustering topics to learn more about categories of consumer complaints.
