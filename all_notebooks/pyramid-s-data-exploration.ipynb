It is almost certain that the methodology to obtain the volume varies from a pyramid to another, the two pyramids with a perfect 0.0 difference had probably their volume computed mathematically (but such a perfection is very unlikely to be found in real life), and those with high \"errors\" were probably measured with other media (maybe, e.g., taking only the cavities into account, which could explain high differences).

It does not include all pyramids, and some data is missing. Nonetheless, it is complete enough to find very interesting insights. In this short exploration, we saw that the highest pyramids were built during the eldest ages, and that they specifically belongs to the northern area of Egypt. We also saw that all configurations height/slope are not allowed (probably for physical reasons). So there is a lot to learn from such a dataset. There are also interrogations that remain, for example the strange values we observed about the volumes of the pyramids. Maybe an egyptologist would be able to explain them, which could open new perspectives on the dataset. So, as last words, I would like to quote the author of the dataset:"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*DEAR EGYPTOLOGISTS, PLEASE HELP ME UPDATE THE DATASET IF YOU HAVE MORE INFO (let's include temples also)*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I totally agree with that.
