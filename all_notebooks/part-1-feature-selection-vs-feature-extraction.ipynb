The term usually refers to Pearson's chi-square test. \n\nThe chi squared test can be used to test for the probability of independence between two datasets and for performing a goodness-of-fit test. Here we will be using it for testing the probability of independence between two datasets. It will not tell any details about the relationship between them. For instance, in a survey conducted in which the ages of participants are recorded, a chi squared test can be used to determine if age affects the survey responses, or if the two are independent. \n\nChi-square score is commonly used for testing relationships between categorical variables and like any statistical hypothesis test, the chi square test has both a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe null hypothesis states that there is no relationship between the categorical variables while the alternative hypothesis states that there is a relationship between the variables.\n\nThe Chi-square test of independence works by comparing the distribution that you observe to the distribution that you expect if there is no relationship between the categorical variables. In the Chi-square context, the word “expected” is equivalent to what you’d expect if the null hypothesis is true. If your observed distribution is sufficiently different than the expected distribution (no relationship), you can reject the null hypothesis and infer that the variables are related.\n\nThe chi squared statistic for interdependence is defined by \n\n### $$\\chi^2 = \\sum \\dfrac{(Observed - Expected)^2}{Expected}$$\n\nBefore we start calculating the chi squared score lets look at how a typical contingency table would look like\n\n<table style=\"width:100%; border:1px solid black\">\n    \n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Features </th> \n<th colspan=\"4\" style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Class Labels </th>\n</tr>\n    \n<tr>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Class 1 </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Class 2 </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> ....... </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Class n </td>\n</tr>\n    \n<tr>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Feature 1 </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{1,1} $$ </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{1,2} $$ </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> ....... </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{1,n} $$ </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Row 1 total </td>\n</tr>\n    \n<tr>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Feature 2 </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{2,1} $$ </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{2,2} $$ </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> ....... </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{2,n} $$ </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Row 2 total </td>\n</tr>\n    \n<tr>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> : </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> : </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> : </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> : </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> : </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> : </td>\n</tr>\n    \n<tr>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Feature n </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{n,1} $$ </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{n,2} $$ </td> \n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> ....... </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> $$ Observation_{n,n} $$ </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Row n total </td>\n</tr>\n    \n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Column 1 total </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Column 2 total </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> ....... </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> Column n total </td>\n<td style=\"border:1px solid black; text-align:center\"> <b> N </b> </td>\n</tr>\n    \n</table>\n\n<br>\n\nThe chi square test for independence proceeds as follows :\n\n1.

Lets split the alcohol feature vector such that values less than 11.55 % alcohol content we will regard it as medium low alcohol content wine (1) and greater than 11.55 %  as medium high alcohol content wines (0). I have chosen this format as most of the alcohol datapoints lie in the medium-low alchol content range so we can see if medium-low alcohol content correlates well with quality.\n\n#### Feature 2 : Volatile acidity\n\nVolatile acidity (VA) is a measure of the wine's gaseous acids that contributes to the smell and taste of vinegar in wine. Volatile acidity at too high levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.\n\nVolatile acidity is measured as $ \\dfrac{g(acetic acid)}{L^{3}} $. Volatile acidity concentration is regulated by the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, and allowable levels for various wine styles can be found in the Code of Federal Regualtions (CFR). The mentioned regulations for red and white wines are 1.4 and 1.2 g(acetic acid)/L respectively.\n\nLets split the VA feaure vector such that values less than 0.7 we will regard it as low VA (1) and greater than 0.7 we will regard it as high VA(0).

Default None\n\nMaths behind MI:\n\nSince our matrix is a dense matrix we will see the formula for mutual information for continuous distributions \n\n### $$ I(X;Y) = \\int_y\\int_x p_{(X,Y)}(x,y)\\log{\\dfrac{p_{(X,Y)}(x,y)}{p_X(x)p_Y(y)}}dxdy$$\n\n$p_{X,Y}$ is the joint probability density function of X and Y.\n$p_X$ and $p_Y$ are the marginal probability density functions of X and Y respectively.\n\nJoint Probability Distribution (Discrete case)\n\nX and Y are two discrete random variables. X takes values {x1, x2 .. xn} (can take 'n' values) and Y takes values {y1,y2 .. ym} (can take 'm' values). The ordered pair takes values in the product {(x1,y1),(x2,y2), .. (xn,yn)}. The joint probability mass function (joint pmf) of X and Y is the function p(xi,yj) giving the probability of the joint outcome X = xi and Y = yj.\n\nThis is organized in a joint probability table as follows :\n\n\n\n> Reference : https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading7a.pdf\n\nJoint Probability Distribution (Continuous case)\n\nIn the continuous case discrete sets are replaced with continuous intervals and the joint probability mass function (joint pmf) is replaced with joint probability density functions (joint pdf).\n\nIf X takes values in [a,b] and Y takes values in [c,d] then the pair (X,Y) takes values in the product [a,b] x [c,d]. The joint probability density function is the function f(x,y) giving the probability density at (x,y). That is, the probability that (X, Y) is in a small rectangle of width dx and height dy around (x, y) is f(x,y)dx dy \n\n\n\n> Reference : https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading7a.pdf\n\nNote : probability density functions can take values greater than 1 as they are probability densities and not probabilities.\n\nMarginal Probability Distribution\n\nThe individual probability distribution of a random variable is reffered to as its marginal probability distribution.\n\nWhen the joint probability function concides with the product of the marginal probability functions that is when X and Y are independent (and hence observing Y tells you nothing about X).\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.2 Wrapper Method"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Feature_selection_Wrapper_Method.png)\n\n> Reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection\n\nWrapper methods are based on greedy search algorithms as they evaluate all possible combinations of the features and select the combination that produces the best result for a specific machine learning algorithm. Some disadvantages associated with wrapper methods are :\n\n1. Testing all possible combinations of the features can be computationally expensive if the features set is too large.\n\n2. When number of observations is insufficient there is increased risk of overfitting.\n\nWrapper methods for feature selection can be divided into three categories:\n\n### 1. Step forward feature selection / Forward Feature Selection\n\nIn the first step, the performance of the classifier is evaluated with respect to each feature. The feature that performs the best is selected out of all the features. Selected feature depends on the evaluation criteria (prediction accuracy, RMSE etc). Next all possible combinations of the selected feature and subsequent feature are evaluated and second feature is selected. This process is continued until the required pre-defined number of features is selected.\n\n### 2. Step backward feature selection / Backward Feature Elimination\n\nHere we start with all the features in the dataset, and then we evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithm. After that, at each iteration, backward feature elimination removes one feature at a time. It continues removing features until a certain criterion is satified.\n\n### 3. Exhaustive feature selection\n\nThe performance of the machine learning algorithm is evaluated against all possible subsets of features in the dataset. You can define the minimum and maximum number of features to have in a subset. The feature subset that yields best performance is selected. A downside to exhaustive feature selction is that it can be slower than compared to step forward or step backward feature selections.\n\n**As a rule of thumb, if the dataset is small, exhaustive feature selection method should be the choice, however, in case of large datasets, step forward or step backward feature selection methods should be preferred.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.3 Embedded Method"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Feature_selection_Embedded_Method.png)\n\n> Reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection\n\nIn embedded methods the feature selction process is added within the construction of the machine learning algorithm. They complete the feature selection process during the model training. The learning algorithm takes advantage of its variable selection process and performs feature selection and classificaton/regression at the same time."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.
