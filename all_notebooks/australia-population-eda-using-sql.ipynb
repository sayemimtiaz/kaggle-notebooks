It is Australia’s national statistical agency and an official source of independent, reliable information. They tell the real story of Australia, its economy and its people by bringing life and meaning to numbers.\n\nThis data contains statistics about the population and components of change (births, deaths, migration) for Australia and its states and territories covering between 01.06.1981 and 1.09.2020. Data was collected quarterly.\n\n___ \n\n## About this notebook\n\nThis notebook consists of analysis and visualization of the provided data using SQL and various packages. With charts and queries, this notebook helps to analysie various aspects of Australian population since 1980.\n\n### Tasks peformed in this notebook\n\n1. Reading and adding the data into SQL DB as SQL tables.\n2. Birth rate of Australia (1980 to 2020)\n3. Death rate of Australia (1980 to 2020)\n4. Death vs Birth rate of Australia (1980 to 2020)\n5. Overseas arrival vs overseas departure chart\n6.
