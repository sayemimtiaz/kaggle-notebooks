Procurement requirements (specification of goods/services/works) are published before the auction and any company can apply online by downloading neccesary documents and become a Participant. During the auction Participants are competing by lowering price that they ask for fullfiling the contract. After three rounds of auction Participant that offered the lowest price is announced a winner. After this Organizer checks the documents submitted by the winner before the auction. If everything is alright, Organizer signs the contract with the winner and this company becomes a Supplier. If there are problems with documents, Organizer disqualifies such company and proceeds to check the documents of company that offered second lowest price. This process is continued until the Supplier is determined or there are no more non-disqualified Participants left.  \n**In the dataset unique procurment identifier is variable lot_id.**  \n  \n[2] Organizer can by a government body (e.g. department of a Ministry or Agency), a school, hospital, police department of a city, public company, city council, etc. **The unique identifier of an Organizer in the dataset is variable organizer_code.** You can use variable organizer_name to better understand who is a particular Organizer. All Organizers names are in Ukrainian, but with with something like Google Translate you will be able to deal with it.  \n  \n[3] **Participants are uniquely identified by variable participant_code.** Variable participant_name can be used by investigators to gather additional information about company of interest. Participant that became a Supplier as a result of an auction is identified with supplier_dummy variable (1 if Participant became a supplier).  \n  \n[4] Initial value of public procurement auction corresponds to the reserve price from the auction theory. It is the highest acceptable value of contract that is published by Organizer as a part of procurement announcement. During the auction, the first bid of a Participant should be lower or equal to the Initial value.  \n  \nFinal value is a lowest value of a contract offered as a result of an auction.\n  \n[5] According to Ukrainian Law there are different types of competitive public procurements. All types determine the winner using the same type of three-round online auction.  \n\n**Below Threshold** procurements are used to procure small amounts of goods/services/works. Their initial value (starting price of auction) should be no more than UAH 200 K (approximately USD 7.5 K as of June 2020) for goods/services and UAH 1.5 M (USD 56.6 K) for works.\nBelow Threshold procements are less strictly regulated than other types. Most importantly, if only one company will apply to participate in an acution, it will be automatically announced a winner and Orgnizer will proceed to check its documents. All other types of competitive procurements require at least two Participants.\n\n**Above Threshold UA** prcedure is a \"default\" competitive procument procedure. It is applied for goods/services with initial value of contract above UAH 200 K and works above UAH 1.5 M. At least two auction Participants are required. If this condition is not satisfied, procurement is cancelled and announced again.\n\n**Above Threshold UA Defense** is a procedure used for defence procurements. Because this types of contracts are deamed especially important and often need to be signed quickly, Participants that offered the lowest price during the auction have a right to correct minor mistakes in submitted documents if such mistakes were found by the Organizer. In the case of other types of procurement, Participant is immedeatly disqualified if any mistake in documents is detected.\n\n**Above Threshold EU** - is procurement procedure for \"large\" procurements. It is applied if initial value of a contract to procure goods/services is be above EUR 133 K and a contract to procure works is above EUR 5.15 M. In contrast to other types, documents of all Participants are checked before the auction and only elegible are allowed to participate.\n\nImportantly, Law of Ukraine \"On Public Procurement\" was changed in 2020, so currently competitive public procurements work slightly differently. However, the provided description is true for the 2015-2019 procurements in the dataset.\n\n[6] CPV stands for Common Procurement Vocabulary it is a methodology developed by European Union to classify objects of public procumerements. The 2 digits CPV code is the highest level of classification, the 4 digits and 8 digits CPV codes provide further clarification of 2 digits CPV category (e.g., 09 stands for Petroleum products, fuel, electricity and other sources of energy; 0910 Fuels; 09111210 Hard coal).\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Example of one auction\nLets select a random auction using **lot_id** as an auction identifier"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"np.random.seed(12)\nauction_list = data.lot_id.unique()\nauction_number = np.random.randint(0, len(auction_list))\nauction_target = auction_list[auction_number]\n\n\n\nprint(f'ID of the target auction is {auction_target}\\n')\n\ndata_auction = data.query(f'lot_id == \"{auction_target}\"')\n\nauction_date = data_auction.index[0].date()\n\norganizer_name = data_auction.organizer_name[0]\norganizer_code = data_auction.organizer_code[0]\norganizer_region = data_auction.organizer_region[0]\n\nobject_cpv2 = data_auction.lot_cpv_2_digs[0]\nobject_cpv4 = data_auction.lot_cpv_4_digs[0]\nobject_cpv8 = data_auction.lot_cpv[0]\n\nparticipants_number = len(data_auction)\n\nwinner_name = data_auction.query('supplier_dummy == 1').participant_name[0]\nwinner_code = data_auction.query('supplier_dummy == 1').participant_code[0]\nwinner_region = data_auction.query('supplier_dummy == 1').participant_region[0]\n\nvalue_initial = data_auction.lot_initial_value[0]\nvalue_final = data_auction.lot_final_value[0]\n\n\n\ndisplay(data_auction)\n\nprint(f'''Target auction was announced {auction_date} by {organizer_name} (Organizer ID {organizer_code}) from the {organizer_region} region. \nOrganizer wanted to procure \"{object_cpv2}\".
