Our main guiding principles in approaching this exercise were:\n\n- **Take an open and transparent approach to using data**\n- **Make the approach easy to replicate or customise**\n- **Make the logic behind the recommendations easily explainable and, therefore, usable to all stakeholders**\n- **Align most strongly to the main mission – &quot;**** identifying talented underserved students **_… in order to_** increase diversity** _of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test.&quot;_\n\nWe have consciously steered away from the temptation of applying a machine learning algorithm to this data, as we felt that that would make our solution less user friendly or reproduceable, without adding any extra value.\n\nOur entire approach can be easily reproduced using a spreadsheet, and therefore has no dependence on a technical team to translate into a working model.\n\nWe will be happy to share the original excel model on request as well.\n\n**Defining the problem statement**\n\nPASSNYC and its partners provide outreach services that improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in these specialized high schools.\n\n>**Identify the schools where minority and underserved students stand to gain the most from services like after school programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents.**\n\nI am further using the inputs given by Ryan J S Baxter and Akeel6passnyc in the recent AMA:\n\n>&quot;Outreach efforts can be broad and relatively inexpensive (targeted mailers, information handouts, email campaigns, etc), while programmatic interventions (prep courses, workshops, tutoring, etc) are more expensive and are designed to actually impact scores rather than simply engage families in learning about the tests. PASSNYC is engaged in multi-tiered approach to this problem and looking to create **solutions to awareness** (knowing about the test and schools), **participation** (taking the test), **and preparedness** (preparing for the test). NYC schools tend to have 100 - 300 students per grade so most outreach efforts target the entire grade while most programmatic interventions target participation from one fourth to one half of a grade at a particular school.&quot;\n\n>&quot;this particular project (the kernel) is focused on **increasing test taking** our larger mission seeks to develop solutions that will also support **other elements such as preparation**.&quot;\n\n**Datasets**   **used**\n\nApart from the datasets provided in the challenge, we will be using the following open datasets:\n\nMandatory datasets [https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good](https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good)\n\n1. School explorer\n2. D5 SHSAT registration data\n\nSocrata datasets\n\n1. NYC school safety report [https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/ny-2010-2016-school-safety-report](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/ny-2010-2016-school-safety-report)\n2.

PASSNYC resource centers [https://www.kaggle.com/infocusp/passnyc-resource-centers](https://www.kaggle.com/infocusp/passnyc-resource-centers) (created by Infocusp)\n2. NYC ELA and Math State Test Results [https://www.kaggle.com/araraonline/nys-ela-and-math-test-results](https://www.kaggle.com/araraonline/nys-ela-and-math-test-results) (shared by André Alcântara, similar to the open data)\n\n**Scope and assumptions**\n\nOur solution will be restricted to schools that\n\n- Offer grades 7, 8 or 9 (the grades in which you are eligible to take SHSAT)\n- Have a high percentage of blacks / hispanics (as these are the underrepresented communities)\n\nThis scope is based on the following:\n\n- Most data points like economic index, geographical demography, school safety parameters are strongly related to the percentage of blacks/Hispanics\n- Asians have been excluded from this recommendation as they are not under represented in the SHST schools\n- As this test is taken in the middle grades, therefore most impact will be felt by reaching out to schools that offer atleast upto 7th grade\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAt the end of this notebook, you will be able to download csv files with schools ranked in order of priority for each of the following reccomendations\n\n1. **Increasing awareness** (targeted mailers, information handouts, email campaigns, etc)\n  - The main parameter for this recommendation will be low participation in the SHSAT test\n2. **Increase participation** (Increase awareness + offer mentoring and counselling)\n  - This recommendation will use a combination of the above parameter and also parameters like the Math and ELA scores to further present schools that seem to have good quality of education and therefore may not require any other intervention\n  - We will further try to offer more targeted recommendations based on inputs from the school safety report to offer after school programs in areas that may benefit from access to safe spaces and community activities. (This is based on the assumption that children from unsafe areas may not be prioritising their education, and require some counselling and mentoring)\n3. **Increasing preparedness through programmatic interventions** (prep courses, workshops, tutoring, etc\n  - As this is the most expensive intervention, we will focus on schools that are already participating in SHSATs but are receiving very few offers.\n  - This recommendation uses a combinations of participation, average scores and the success rate of the participating students' ability to receive the SHSAT offer\n\nApart from the above recommendations, there will be a list that **matches schools**** with ****each of the PASSNYC resource centres.** This list will be based on the following parameters:\n\n- Type of intervention recommended for the school matched with the type of program offered by the partner\n- Proximity of school to the PASSNYC centre (our assumption is that a student will be comfortable in travelling upto 2 miles to the partner centre)\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"699740536abe1b9dccf56a219115cc9c89b17f9c","_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Initial steps: Ingesting, pre processing data')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f51bcf73d900d4972c43991f1d420e42532e9ea1","collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing libraries\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\nimport plotly.plotly as py\nimport seaborn as sns \nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport random as rnd\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom math import sin, cos, sqrt, atan2, radians","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3114f5a1081575b71990ec84dcca82df5f2545e1","_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Loading needed databases\n\nSchool_exp = pd.read_csv(\"../input/data-science-for-good/2016 School Explorer.csv\")\nD5 = pd.read_csv(\"../input/data-science-for-good/D5 SHSAT Registrations and Testers.csv\")\nSchool_safety = pd.read_csv(\"../input/ny-2010-2016-school-safety-report/2010-2016-school-safety-report.csv\")\nSHSAT = pd.read_csv(\"../input/2017-2018-shsat-admissions-test-offers-by-schools/2017-2018 SHSAT Admissions Test Offers By Sending School.csv\")\nCenter_list = pd.read_csv(\"../input/passnyc-resource-centers/passnyc-resource-centers.csv\")\nSchool_demo = pd.read_csv(\"../input/ny-school-demographics-and-accountability-snapshot/2006-2012-school-demographics-and-accountability-snapshot.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"db91f1b7524393242c53b01fedcd8916da1fedab","_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Preprocessing\n\nD5.set_index('Year of SHST',inplace=True, drop=True) #Changing index \nD5 = D5.drop([2013, 2014, 2015]) ##Dropping rows that will not be used\n\nSchool_safety.set_index('School Year',inplace=True, drop=True) #Changing index \nSchool_safety = School_safety.drop(['2013-14','2014-15'])  ##Dropping columns that will not be used\n\nSchool_safety = School_safety.dropna(subset = ['DBN'])\n\nSchool_exp = pd.merge(School_exp, School_safety, how='left', left_on='Location Code', right_on='DBN')\nSchool_exp = pd.merge(School_exp, SHSAT, how='left', left_on='DBN', right_on='School DBN')\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d02d48ba5a0c83fd7981f42e3f7d53c22f7afb5f","_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"School_exp.set_index('DBN',inplace=True, drop=True)\nD5.set_index('DBN',inplace=True, drop=True)\nSchool_exp = School_exp.join(D5)\n\nSchool_exp = School_exp.drop(columns=['Adjusted Grade','New?','Other Location Code in LCGMS','Location Code_x','SED Code','Grade Low','Grade 3 ELA -
