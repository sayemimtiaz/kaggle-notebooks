Many different libraries like `pandas`,`numpy`,`matplotlib`,`seaborn` or `sklearn` are required to do the work. To import these libraries, different lines of codes are required as follows:-\n\n#### **import pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy**\n\n-`import pandas as pd`\n\n-`import numpy as np`\n\n-`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`\n\n-`import seaborn as sns`\n\n\n- Now, everytime before you can start with the actual work, you will have to import your libraries by writing the above lines of code.

With this backend, the output of plotting commands is displayed inline within frontends like the Jupyter notebook, directly below the code cell that produced it.
