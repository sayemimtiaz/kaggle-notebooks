There are a number of organisations such as DonorsChoose.org, Patreon, Kickstarter which hosts the crowdfunding projects on their platforms. Kickstarter has hosted more than 250,000 projects on their website with more than $4 Billion collective amount raised.  \n<br>\n\n![](https://people.safecreative.org/viewimage/viewmagazine?path=kickstarter-patreon.jpg&defaultPath=)\n\n<br>\nWhile it is true that crowdfunding is one of the most popular methods to to raise funds however the reality is that **not every project is able to completely reach the goal**. Infact, on KickStarter, only about 35 percent of the total projects have raised successful fundings in the past. This fact raises an important question - **which projects are able to successfully achieve their goal?**. In other words, can project owners somehow know what are the key project characteristics that increases the chances of success. \n\nIn many studies, Researchers and analysts have used the descriptive analysis methods on the crowdfunding data to obtain insights related to project success. While many others have also applied predictive modelling to obtain the probability of project success. However, these approaches have the fundamental problems: \n\n- Descriptive analysis - only gives surface level insights    \n- Predictive analysis - models act as the blackboxes    \n\n### About this Kernel  \nIn this kernel, I have shared a hybrid analysis approach that uses the concepts of both types of analysis enriched with the concepts of **machine learning explainability** which can be used to answer the key questions related to the success (or failure) of any crowdfunding project. The framework uses the interpretations derived from a trained machine learning model. Unlike descriptive analysis to find key insights, the focus in this approach is to make use of model behaviours and characteristics such as : Relative Feature Importances, Partial Dependencies, Permutation Importances, SHAP values. I have explained the intuition behind every approach in layman terms. Following are the contents of the kernel: \n\n## <font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">Contents</font> \n\n1. <a href=\"#1\">Business Use-Case and Problem Statement</a>    \n2. <a href=\"#2\">Hypothesis Generation</a>    \n3. <a href=\"#3\">Dataset Preparation</a>     \n4. <a href=\"#4\">Modelling the Project Success</a>       \n5. <a href=\"#5\">Model Interpretation : Insights Generation</a>    \n    <a href=\"#5-1\">5.1 Which are the most important features (relatively) of a project?

Understanding the Business Use Case</font>   </h2><br>\nThe essential business use-cases in the crowdfunding scenario can be considered from two different perspectives - from the project owner's perspective and the companies perspective. \n\n1. From the **project owner's perspective**, it is highly beneficial to be aware about the key characteristics of a project that greatly influence the success of any project. For instance, it will be interesting to pre-emptively know about following questions:   \n\n     - What is an ideal and optimal range of the funding goal for my project ?  \n     - On which day of the week, I should post the project on Kickstarter ?  \n     - How many keywords should I use in my project title ?  \n     - What should be the total length of my project description ?     \n\n\n2. From the **perspective of companies** which hosts the crowdfunding projects such as DonorsChoose.org, Patreon, and Kickstarter, they receive hundreds of thousands of project proposals every year. A large amount of manual effort is required to screen the project before it is approved to be hosted on the platform. This creates the challenges related to scalability, consistency of project vetting across volunteers, and identification of projects which require special assistance. \n\nIt is due to these two perspectives, there is a need to dig deeper and find more intutive insights related to the projects success. Using these insights, more people can get their projects funded more quickly, and with less cost to the hosting companies. This also allows the hosting companies to optimize the processes and channel even more funding directly to projects.   \n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n<h2><font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">2. Hypothesis Generation </font>   </h2> <br>\nHypothesis Generation is very powerful technique which can help an analyst to structure a very insightful and a relevant solution of a business problem. It is a process of building an intuitive approach of the business problem without even thinking about the available data. Whenever I start with any new business problem, I try to make a comprehensive list of all the factors which can be used to obtain the final output. For example, which features should affect my predictions. Or, which values of those features will give me the best possible result. In case of crowdfunding, the question can be - which features are very important to decide if a project will be successful or not.  \n\nSo, to generate the hypothesis for the use-case, we will write down a list of factors (without even looking at the available data) that can possibly be important to model the project success.   \n\n1. **Total amount to be raised** - More amount may decrease the chances that the project will be successful.  \n2. **Total duration of the project** - It is possible that projects which are active for very short or very long time periods are not successful.  \n3. **Theme of the project** - People may consider donating to a project which has a good cause or a good theme.  \n4. **Writing style of the project description** - If the message is not very clear, the project may not get complete funding.  \n5. **Length of the project description** - Very long piecies of text may not perform good as compared to shorter crisp texts.  \n6. **Project launch time** - A project launched on weekdays as compared to weekends or holidays may not get complete funding amount.  \n\nSo this is an incomplete list of possible factors we can think at this stage that may influence the project success. Now, using machine learning interpretability, not only we can try to understand which features are actually important but also what are the feature values which these features can take. \n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n<h2><font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">3.

We can now start the analysis, modelling, and interpretting in order to find out the key insights. First, we load the available dataset. \n\n### <font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">3.1 Load Dataset</font> "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c76367960e92c4819776cd646556fe14213ca27f","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## load required libraries \nfrom plotly.offline import iplot, init_notebook_mode\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom pdpbox import pdp, get_dataset, info_plots\nfrom eli5.sklearn import PermutationImportance\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np \nimport warnings\nimport eli5\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\ndef syllable_count(word):\n    word = word.lower()\n    vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n    count = 0\n    if word[0] in vowels:\n        count += 1\n    for index in range(1, len(word)):\n        if word[index] in vowels and word[index - 1] not in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    if word.endswith(\"e\"):\n        count -= 1\n    if count == 0:\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\nprojects = pd.read_csv(\"../input/ks-projects-201801.csv\", parse_dates = [\"launched\", \"deadline\"])\n\nprint (\"Total Projects: \", projects.shape[0], \"\\nTotal Features: \", projects.shape[1])\nprojects.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d95c7c17009458684d7ead7f1d4004f3e6de9ba9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">3.2 Dataset Preprocessing</font>  \n\nIn this dataset, we can see that a number of features are about the active stage of the project.

Also, we add some extra information with category such as the popularity of the category calculated from the total number of projects posted in that category.  \n\n    - Category Count and Sub Category Count : Generally how many projects are posted in those categories. This gives an idea if the project belongs to a more generic category or is more of a rare project  \n    - Category / Sub-Category Mean Goal : Generally what is the average goal set in those categories / sub-categories. This gives an idea if the project's goal is much higher or much lower than the standard mean goal of that category.   \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f174fd01250940d0e200b6be2baaf335a9ec065a","_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"## feature engineering\nprojects[\"syllable_count\"]   = projects[\"name\"].apply(lambda x: syllable_count(x))\nprojects[\"launched_month\"]   = projects[\"launched\"].dt.month\nprojects[\"launched_week\"]    = projects[\"launched\"].dt.week\nprojects[\"launched_day\"]     = projects[\"launched\"].dt.weekday\nprojects[\"is_weekend\"]       = projects[\"launched_day\"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 4 else 0)\nprojects[\"num_words\"]        = projects[\"name\"].apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))\nprojects[\"num_chars\"]        = projects[\"name\"].apply(lambda x: len(x.replace(\" \",\"\")))\nprojects[\"duration\"]         = projects[\"deadline\"] - projects[\"launched\"]\nprojects[\"duration\"]         = projects[\"duration\"].apply(lambda x: int(str(x).split()[0]))\nprojects[\"state\"]            = projects[\"state\"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x==\"successful\" else 0)\n\n## label encoding the categorical features\nprojects = pd.concat([projects, pd.get_dummies(projects[\"main_category\"])], axis = 1)\nle = LabelEncoder()\nfor c in [\"category\", \"main_category\"]:\n    projects[c] = le.fit_transform(projects[c])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9952a1b16fae7368c9ec610a5bddf0ba42461a70"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For Category and Main Category, I have used LabelEncoder, Some people may argue that LE may not be a perfect choice for this rather OneHot Encoder should be used.

This will be answered when we apply other techniques in the next sections.

This means that in comparison to other features what is the importance of a particular feature. \n\nBut a question here is - Even if it is relative, what if some features from a set of features are removed, do we still obtain the same feature importances ? This problem can infact be formulated as graph problem. Consider a graph based structure, in which every feature (of the dataset) is a node, and the edges are defined between two features (nodes) if the two features appers in the *top 10 important features of the individual decision tree*. \n\n**But, What is the benefit?** Well, Some of the problems when viewed as network or graph problems can help to identify the solutions quickly and easily. For instance, using the graph properties one can identify which is the most important node of the network. A node having higher degree centrality (connections) indicates that the node is highly connected to the network. Which means that if a node is removed from the network, a large majority of the network will be disrupted. \n\nThis idea can be applied to relative feature importances, a feature which is highly important, which appears in most of the decision tree's top 10 feature can be clearly identified from the feature importance network graph. If this feature is removed from the dataset then the predictions will be affacted. Let's plot this network.

(Permutation Importance) </font>   </h2>   \n\nIn the last section, we mainly identified which the features at a very high level which are relatively important to the model outcome. In this section, we will go a little deeper and understand which features has the biggest impact on the model predictions (in absolute sense). One of the ways to identify such behaviour is to use permutation importance. \n\nThe idea of permutation importance is very straightforward. After training a model, the model outcomes are obtained. The most important features for the model are the ones if the values of those feature are randomly shuffled then they lead to biggest drops in the model outcome accuracies. Let's look at the permutation importance of features of our model."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ef0484c446818ff6fc6293d5d9a18159635270c9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from eli5.sklearn import PermutationImportance\nimport eli5\nperm = PermutationImportance(model1, random_state=1).fit(X_test, y_test)\npi_df = eli5.explain_weights_df(perm, feature_names = X_test.columns.tolist())\npi_df[\"color\"] = pi_df[\"weight\"].apply(lambda x : \"green\" if x > 0 else \"red\")\n\ndata = [\n    go.Bar(\n        orientation = \"h\",\n        y = pi_df.feature[::-1],\n        x = pi_df.weight[::-1],\n        marker = dict(\n            opacity = 0.5,\n            color = pi_df.color[::-1]        ),\n        error_x = dict( type='data', color=\"#9fa3a3\",\n            array=list(pi_df[\"std\"][::-1]),\n            visible=True),\n        name = 'expenses'\n    )\n]\n\n\nlayout = go.Layout(title=\"Permutation Importance\", height = 800, margin=dict(l=300))\n\nannotations = []\nfor i, row in pi_df.iterrows():\n    dict(y=row.feature, x=row.weight, text=\"d\",\n                                  font=dict(family='Arial', size=14,\n                                  color='rgba(245, 246, 249, 1)'),\n                                  showarrow=False,)\nlayout['annotations'] = annotations\nfig = go.Figure(data=data, layout = layout)\niplot(fig, filename='base-bar')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"712bd0333c35c5d96cef14f34068b3aa3b85a620"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Inferences** \n> - This is an interesting plot, We can observe that the features shown in top and in green are the most important as if their values are randomized then the outcome performance suffers.   \n> - We can observe that the top features are are the features which we mostly saw in the relative importance section, but using this graph we can quantify the amount of importance associated with them.

Final Conclusions</font>  \n\nAfter applying these different techniques we understood that there are certain factors which increases or decreases the chances of a project successfully able to raise the funds. Both from project owner's and the company's perspective it is important to set the optimal values of project goal and the duration. A large duration or a very large amount may not be able completely successful. At the same time it is important to choose right number of words and characters in the name of the project. For example, a project having very few or very large number of words and characters may become less intutive and less self explanatory. Similarly, the project category also plays a crutial role, There will be some categories on the platform in which total number of projects are very large, these are so called popular categories. The chances may be higher if the project is posted in a popular category rather than a rare category. \n\nIn this kernel, I shared a general framework which I follow while solving any data science or analytics problem. This framework can be applied to many other different use-cases as well. The main focus of this kernel was different techniques related to machine learning explanability. Mainly, I used relative feature importance, permutation importance, partial dependecies, and shap values. In my opinion, here are some pros and cons of these techniques. Apart from these techniques, there are other alternatives as well (such as skater, lime). \n\n<table>\n    <tr><td>Technique</td> <td>Pros</td> <td>Cons</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Feature Importance</td> <td>1. Available in almost all tree based models </td> <td>1. Does not gives the absolute ranking rather a relative ranking, hence it changes significantly with more number of features <br> 2. More accurate inferences requires more data, more iterations, more decision trees</td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Permutation Importance</td> <td>1. Easier, Fast to implement <br> 2. Does not require to train the model again and again </td> <td>1. Randomization of results <br> 2. Results on training can differ from that on test <br> 3. It only gives a single feature importance, but it is possible that a feature is not independent rather is important due to the presence of some other features. <br> 4. Requires a good amount of data to obtain good final values </td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Partial Dependencies</td> <td>1. Easier, faster to implement. <br> 2. Understanding of plots is simple yet powerful</td> <td>1. Very difficult to obtain the partial dependencies for more than 2 (or 3) features. </td></tr>\n    <tr><td>SHAP Values</td> <td>1. Backed by an excellent theory which provides a reasonable foundation</td> <td>1. Very slow to compute the aggregated effects <br> 2. It does not provide an exact solution rathar an approximate solution <br> 3. Somewhat difficult to interpret</td></tr>\n   </table>\n\n## References \n* https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability  \n* https://aiukraine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/10_55-Kolbasin-Vladimir-How-to-explain-your-network_v2.pdf  \n* https://github.com/lopusz/awesome-interpretable-machine-learning  \n* https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/index.html  \n* https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretable-machine-learning-with-xgboost-9ec80d148d27   \n* https://www.kaggle.com/cast42/lightgbm-model-explained-by-shap   \n* http://savvastjortjoglou.com/intrepretable-machine-learning-nfl-combine.html  \n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-yT5Is1G1A    \n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqC8UPw9SU  \n* https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2018/07/explaining_ml_models_code_caret_iml/  \n\nThanks for reading this notebook, if you liked it please upvote it and share the feedback.
