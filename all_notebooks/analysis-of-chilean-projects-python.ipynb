When a company wants to carry out a project of a relatively large magnitude, it should present a requirement to the SEA to evaluate the correct and safety operation of that project. In this way if a project is detectable as harmful to the environment or population, the service can deny the environmental permit and thereby the start-up of a project. From the starting point of SEA in 1997, more than 15 thousand of projects have been evaluated by this service, thereby the database of SEA contains a large number of registers, which can be useful to analyze. \n\n<img src=\"https://sea.gob.cl/sites/default/files/styles/noticia_portada/public/imagenes/bloque-estilo-pagina-estatica/sea_2d8d4.png?itok=ojZ7om3H\">\n\nNotice that projects can present a environmental impact statement (DIA in spanish) or a environmental impact study (EIA). This depend on the magnitude of potential impacts to the environment or health population. DIA means a simple evaluation of impacts, while EIA corresponds to a more complex assessment. With this information, several relevant questions can be answered using these data. \n\n* How long is the average time it takes a project to get the final response from the service?\n* What is the most important industry in Chile?\n* What are the regions with most number of projects?\n* Investment is correlated with the getting of permission?\n* What is the proportion of DIA and DIA?\n* EIA are most difficult to get permission?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import relevant libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport folium\nfrom folium import Choropleth, Circle, Marker\nfrom folium.plugins import HeatMap, MarkerCluster\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Set matplotlib config\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.style.use('seaborn')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load data\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/chilean-projects/projects.csv',parse_dates = [\"entry_date\",\"qualification_date\"])\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can observe 26953 projects.
