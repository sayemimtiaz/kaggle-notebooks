Customers select groceries through a web application from various retailers and delivered by a personal shopper. Instacart's service is mainly provided through a smartphone app, available on iOS and Android platforms, apart from its website.\n\nIn 2017 Instacart organised a Kaggle competition and provided to the community a sample dataset of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. The orders include 32 million basket items and 50,000 unique products. The objective of the competition was participants to **predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order**.\n\n## Objective\nThe objective of this Kernel is to introduce students to predictive business analytics with Python through the Instacart case. \n\nBy the time you finish this example, you will be able to:\n* Describe the steps of creating a predictive analytics model\n* Use Python and Pandas package to manipulate data\n* Use Python and Pandas package to create, combine, and delete DataFrames\n* Use Logistic Regression to create a predictive model\n* Apply the predictive model in order to make a prediction\n* Create a submission file for the competition of Instacart\n\n## Problem definition\nThe data that Instacart opened up include orders of 200,000 Instacart users with each user having between 4 and 100 orders. Instacart indicates each order in the data as prior, train or test. Prior orders describe the **past behaviour** of a user while train and test orders regard the **future behaviour that we need to predict**. \n\nAs a result, we want to predict which previously purchased products (prior orders) will be in a user’s next order (train and test orders). \n\nFor the train orders Instacart reveals the results (i.e., the ordered products) while for the test orders we do not have this piece of information. Moreover, the future order of each user can be either train or test meaning that each user will be either a train or a test user. \n\nThe setting of the Instacart problem is described in the figure below (orders with yellow color denotes future orders of a user). \n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/S0Miw3m.png\" width=\"350\">\n\nEach user has purchased various products during their prior orders. Moreover, for each user we know the order_id of their future order. The goal is to predict which of these products will be in a user's future order. \n\nThis is a **classification problem** because we need to predict whether each pair of user and product is a reorder or not. This is indicated by the value of the reordered variable, i.e. reordered=1 or reordered=0 (see figure below). \n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SxK2gsR.png\" width=\"350\">\n\nAs a result we need to come up and calculate various **predictor variables (X)** that will describe the characteristics of a product and the behaviour of a user regarding one or multiple products. We will do so by analysing the prior orders of the dataset. We will then use the train users to create a predictive model and the test users to make our actual prediction. As a result we create a table as the following one and we train an algorithm based on predictor variables (X) and response variable (Y).\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Yb1CKAF.png\" width=\"600\">\n\n## Method\nOur method includes the following steps:\n1. <b>Import and reshape data</b>: This step includes loading CSV files into pandas DataFrames, tranform character variables to categorical variables, and create a supportive table.\n2. <b>Create predictor variables</b>: This step includes identifying and calculating predictor variables (aka features) from the initial datasets provided by Instacart. \n3. <b>Create train and test DataFrames</b>: In this step we create two distinct pandas DataFrames that will be used in the creation and the use of the predictive model.\n4. <b>Create predictive model (fit)</b>: In this step we employ Logistic Regression to create the predictive model through the train dataset.\n5. <b>Apply predictive model (predict)</b>: This step includes applying the model to predict the 'reordered' variable for the test dataset.\n6. <b>Create submission file</b>: In this final step we create the submission file with our predictions for Instacart's competition.\n7. <b>Get F1 score</b>: In this step we submit the produced and file and get the F1 score describing the accuracy of our prediction model."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
