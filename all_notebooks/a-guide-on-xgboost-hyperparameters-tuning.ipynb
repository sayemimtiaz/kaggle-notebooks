We can leverage the maximum power of XGBoost by tuning its hyperparameters.\n\n- The most powerful ML algorithm like XGBoost is famous for picking up patterns and regularities in the data by automatically tuning thousands of learnable parameters. \n\n- In tree-based models, like XGBoost the learnable parameters are the choice of decision variables at each node.\n\n- XGBoost is a very powerful algorithm. So, it will have more design decisions and hence large hyperparameters. These are parameters specified by hand to the algo and fixed throughout a training phase.\n\n- In tree-based models, hyperparameters include things like the maximum depth of the tree, the number of trees to grow, the number of variables to consider when building each tree, the minimum number of samples on a leaf and the fraction of observations used to build a tree.\n\n- Although we focus on optimizing XGBoost hyperparameters in this kernel, the concepts discussed in this kernel applies to any other advanced ML algorithm as well.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2.
