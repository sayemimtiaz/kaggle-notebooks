After investigation, they found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such clients.\n\n### Data Science Problem Statement\n\nPredict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the analysis of the marketing campaigns the bank performed.\n\n### Evaluation Metric\nWe will be using ROC-AUC for evaluation. \n\n### Objective of this template notebook\n\nThe main objective of this template is to take you through the entire working pipeline that you may follow while appraoching a Machine Learning problem.\n\nWe will be defining a task to be performed and write the code to solve the task.\n\n__The tasks performed below should serve as a good guide regarding the steps that you should go about a Machine Learning Problem.
