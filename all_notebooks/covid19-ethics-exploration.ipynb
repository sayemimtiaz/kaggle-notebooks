Feature Engineering\n\n\nThe idea is to create a document represenation which will make a distinction between purely biomedical talk and social and ethical talk via:\n\n\n1. Leverage sciSpaCy's NER pipeline ('en_ner_craft_md') in parallel with the normal language model ('en_core_web_md'), to detect 2 distinguished sets of entities per paragraph:\n    - a set of biomedical domain specific entities using the spacy NER model trained on CRAFT corpus \n    - another set of entities presumabley non biomedical, detected by normal spacy pipeline\n2. Flair DocumentPooling with glove word embeddings as paragraph representation\n    - separate document embedding of each set of entities, concatenated\n\n### 3. Model\n- Pseudo-labeling Semi-supervised ML model \n- binary classification of presence (or not) of discussion of ethical concerns \n\n\n### 4. Demonstration\n- A method to print the text of a given article with highlighted exerpts which the model predicts to be pertinent to ethics\n    \n\n\n### Attributions\n\n- Document representation has been inspired by findings from [this masters thesis](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1378586&dswid=-9770) which suggests that representing a document via flair DocumentPooling of embeddings of named entities provides to be an effective technique for clustering unstructured lifesciences articles. \n\n- The semi-supervised machine learning model is adapted/inspired by [this tutorial](https://github.com/anirudhshenoy/pseudo_labeling_small_datasets/blob/master/pseudo_label-Logistic_reg.ipynb) \n\n- The plotly bibiographic reference graph is adapted from [plotly tutorial code](https://plotly.com/ipython-notebooks/network-graphs/)\n\n\n\n### NOTE about running program\nI've saved all output from this workflow to two directories --> \"/kaggle/input/list-dfs-3\" and \"/kaggle/input/extrad-data\" made public for the task, in order to allow to run this file without running NER extraction, which takes about 2 hours\n- To run with output from spacy pipelines I've used from my machine set NO_NER to True\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Requirements\n\n\n1.

The coronavirus epidemic of 2019-2020, or COVID-19, is no exception, with the World Health Organization warning of a possible \"infodemic\" of fake news. In this study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media, politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations, business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians.

used to extract entity mentions and detect general vs biomedical categories\n- There is potentially an overlap between entity mentions in my processing, where the general spacy pipeline might pick up on the same mention as scispacy! I would have prefered to create a set and separate the sci vs gen mentions...\n- It would be nice to be able to represent the document which has only entities picked up from either of the NER pipelines, so far we only process those which have entities from both...\n- In light of this it might have been more sound to just concat both sets of entities and do a single document pooling\n- In fact, it might have been best after all to do an embedding representation at document-level and not at paragraph-level. \n- That said, lets see the results of this work!\n\n\nOnward: The Semi-supervised ML Model!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.
