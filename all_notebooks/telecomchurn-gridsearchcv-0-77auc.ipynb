It is measured as the percentage of customers that stopped using a company's product or services at the end of a time period by the number of customers it had at the beginning of the time period.\nCustomer churn analysis is used widely by telecommunication services, internet service providers, online streaming services, insuarance firms, etc. as the cost of retaining an existing customer is cheaper than acquiring a new one. Now, churn can be volunatry or  involuntary. Involutary churn can be the decision of a customer to switch to an alternative company or service providers. Involuntary churn includes relocation to other location, death, etc. In majority of the application, analysis is based on involuntary churn which can be primarily due to the customer's current product or service experience of a company or due to a better alternative options provided by a company's business competitors.\nIn this study, we use the data from a telecommunication company to perform churn analysis. Such an analysis will help in understanding the customer retention policies that are required to reduce the churn rate.

Predictive Modeling    \n\nThe objective of this study is to predict the churn vs no-Churn situation from the telecom dataset.Inorder to predict the outcome, we need to predict whether a customer will churn or not i.e.(Churn/NoChurn as (1/0)).\n\nNow for each of the observations, four different events can occur when we try to predict:\n- case 1: predicted as 1 which are actually 1. Also known as True Positives (TP).\n- case 2: predicted as 1 which are actually 0. Also known as False Positives (FP).Also known as Type I error.\n- case 3: predicted as 0 which are actually 0. Also known as True Negatives (TN).\n- case 4: predicted as 0 which are actually 1. Also known as False Negatives (FN).Also known as Type II error.\n\nIn this study, predicting churn accurately is very important as it has a far-reaching impact on the future prospect of the business. This means a prediction analysis will be able to identify case 1 with greater accuracy. This means the objective of the study is to minimize case 4 or Type II error. There are certain criterias based on which prediction models will be judged. Let's look at those criteria.\n\nAccuracy,precision, recall, F1 and specificity are the different types of precision metrics used in evaluating the performance of the prediction models. These are also used to compare the performances between different alternative models. Accuracy measures the ratio of TP and TN given all the observations. Precision measures the ratio of the relevant class (i.e.Churn(1)) correctly predicted given the total number of predictions made for the relevant class. Recall also known as sensitivity measures the ratio of the relevant class given the actual number of observations of the relevant class. F1 score is the weighted average of precision and recall. It is particularly useful when we want to strike a balance between precision and recall. Sensitivity is the ratio of TN given the actual number of observations that belongs to the negative class. Another important metrics are Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) and Area under the Curve (AUC). A good discussion on these metrics are available at: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-auc-roc-curve-68b2303cc9c5.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the important objectives of the prediction model here is to reduce False Negatives (FN). This means that we have to consider improving the recall. But reducing the FN sometimes leads to an increase in FP which means precision may decrease. In this case, I'll look at the F1 scores along with the AUC values to decide on the best model for this study."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import machine learning libraries\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import RFE\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn import svm\nimport xgboost as xgb\n\n# creating the function\n# XGBoost and SVC functions are used while modeling and are thus not presented here\nlogreg = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs', max_iter = 10000)\nDT = DecisionTreeClassifier()\nrfc = RandomForestClassifier()\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a method of selecting a subset of independent variables (features) that are relevant for predicting the target variable i.e. churn in this study.

Conclusion:\n\n**1.**: SMOTE has reduced the gap between precision and recall for the 'churn' class. Precision still remains higher than recall for the 'churn class' except for the Logistic Regression and linear SVM models. For these two models, recall becomes higher than precision. The recall value improved in majority of the models due to a lower False Negatives. The f1-score is between 0.60 and 0.65 for the 'churn' class. \n\n**2.**: The AUC score is now between 0.72 and 0.77. The AUC score decresed for the Decision Tree. Logistic Regression and linear SVM model has the highest AUC score of 0.77. In terms of AUC score, both these models are best suited for this study. I will prefer Logistic Regression because it is simple, intuitive and interpretable."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
