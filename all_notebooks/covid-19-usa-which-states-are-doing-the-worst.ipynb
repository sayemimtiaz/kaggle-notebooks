It does some basic data cleaning, visualizations, and exponential fit analysis.\n\nThe notebook uses US covid spread data from [this kaggle dataset](http://https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa), which originally pulls the data from the [Covid Tracking Project](http://https://covidtracking.com/). We're inundated with news and data about covid every day, and no one analysis will answer all of the questions we have about this virus. With that in mind, this notebook choses to focus on the following questions:\n\nGeneral Status Questions\n - Which states have the most cases? Deaths? Tests?\n - Which states have the highest death rates?\n - Which states are growing at an exponential rate vs a linear rate?\n - Which states have the highest base for their exponential fit (which states are growing at the fastest exponential rate)?\n\nCOVID Policy Questions [TODO]\n - How are states with a shelter in place doing compared to states without?\n - How does case rate change post shelter in place?\n - How does the [social distancing scoreboard](http://https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard) correlate to growth rate?\n - How would forecasts look with/without social distancing?\n \nEconomic Downstream Questions [TODO]\n - How does covid relate to unemployment? Open table data?\n \nI will be updating this notebook as I go, so expect some sections to be missing/incomplete.
