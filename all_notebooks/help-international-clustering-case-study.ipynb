But what is different from the poor countries    is that the Developing countries have lower child mortality rate and total fertility and higher life expectancy compared to the poor countries\n* Under Developed or poor countries have very low exports, imports, health, gdpp, income and life_expectancy.\n* For the under developed countries, the child_mort is proportionalto the total_fer\n    This clearly indicates that the survival rate of the children under 5 years of age is greatly affected by the total children birthed by the mother. Providing affordable contraceptives could help in tackling this issue.\n* Haiti has very high child_mort as well as very low life expectancy\n* Haiti and Lesotho have very very low life expectancy\n* Nigeria has abnormally high inflation rate. A very high inflation rate can be detrimental to the Development of a Country.
