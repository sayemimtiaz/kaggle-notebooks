Please import the following libraries to get started.\n\n## Problem Statement\nImagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.\n\nThe gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:\n\nThumbs up: Increase the volume\n\nThumbs down: Decrease the volume\n\nLeft swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds\n\nRight swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds\n\nStop: Pause the movie\n\n## Understanding the Dataset\nThe training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use.\n\nNote that all images in a particular video subfolder have the same dimensions but different videos may have different dimensions. Specifically, videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160 (depending on the webcam used to record the videos). Hence, you will need to do some pre-processing to standardise the videos.\n\nEach row of the CSV file represents one video and contains three main pieces of information - the name of the subfolder containing the 30 images of the video, the name of the gesture and the numeric label (between 0-4) of the video.\n\nYour task is to train a model on the 'train' folder which performs well on the 'val' folder as well.","metadata":{"id":"jKnFk-08CjDy"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport os\nimport imageio\nfrom skimage.transform import resize, rescale\nimport datetime\nimport os\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"id":"KxstHs2bCjDz","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We set the random seed so that the results don't vary drastically.","metadata":{"id":"dBgO9n9SCjD3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#%tensorflow_version 1.x","metadata":{"id":"QM5kHEOgi7lG","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nprint(tf.__version__)\nnp.random.seed(30)\nimport random as rn\nrn.seed(30)\nfrom keras import backend as K\ntf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()\n#tf.set_random_seed(30)","metadata":{"id":"lMJqGvgLCjD4","outputId":"e7e785f8-f35f-4d8f-94ab-d8987c7b8ea3","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#from zipfile import ZipFile\n#with ZipFile('/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Project_data.zip','r') as zip:\n#    zip.extractall()","metadata":{"id":"pU7zucmdi0bj","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this block, you read the folder names for training and validation.
