This procedure is gaining in popularity, and the number of centers implanting diaphragm pacing systems (DPS) is increasing. DPS delays the need for a ventilation machine in the early stages of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease. In this case study, we present a young female ALS patient. A DPS was implanted after respiratory insufficiency began. In the one-year follow-up period following her operation, her need for ventilatory support disappeared.\"\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26444327/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Diaphragm Pacing System (DPS).

The earliest record of phrenic stimulation for the treatment of asphyxia was reported in 1783. In the mid-1850s, French neurologists also proposed such an idea, but it was Hugo Wilhelm von Ziemssen who performed the first diaphragmatic pacing on a young female patient who had asphyxiated on charcoal vapor.\" \n\n\"The true beginnings of diaphragmatic pacing started in the 1860s and 70s. The father of modern diaphragm pacing is Dr William W L Glenn from Yale University, who showed that the technique was not only practical but could be used clinically for the treatment for several medical disorders. With advances in technology, more refined and flexible electrodes were developed, and the thoracoscopic method of implantation became practical.\"\n\nhttps://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1970348-overview#a4"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.bar(df, \n             x='dpsadmin', y='dpsdsch', color_discrete_sequence=['#2B3A67'],\n             title='Diaphragm Pacing System Device', text='dpsadmin')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Indications and Contraindications </span>**\n\n\"Diaphragm pacing is performed to provide ventilatory support in 2 main clinical scenarios:\n\n\"Central alveolar ventilation, or what is better known as sleep apnea.\n\n\"High spinal cord paralysis in which the drive for respiration is still present but the injury to the spinal cord prevents stimulation from the phrenic nerves\".\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">DPS Contraindications</span>**\n\n\"Diaphragm pacing is contraindicated for patients in whom the phrenic nerve is not functional.

Their findings suggest that insertion of the NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing System at the point an individual with ALS develops respiratory insufficiency is harmful.\"\n\n\"Whether there is a point earlier in the disease trajectory when implantation and pacing might be of benefit is unknown and is currently being investigated. A poor prognosis and the absence of curative treatment understandably encourage a nothing to lose approach in patients and some clinicians alike, with an attendant lowering of the standards of evidence needed to adopt a new intervention.Their findings show the potential for harm that can arise from adopting this approach.\"\n\nAuthors: DiPALS Writing Committee.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474442215001520"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
