We construct this using the bibliography section, which contains metadata related to cited papers. One challenge is the lack of a stable identifier for creating nodes in the network. This notebook outlines a method for constructing the citation network through approximate deduplication of titles.\n\n## Available datasets\n\nThis notebook can be added as a data-source for immediate access to the citation network and its intermediate datasets.\n\ndataset | output type | description \n-|-|-\n`references.parquet` | parquet | the flattened citations from the bibliography\n`titles.parquet` | parquet | list of all titles seen across CORD-19 JSON documents\n`corrections/t{threshold}_citation_index.parquet` | parquet | the index for mapping `sha1` of titles to their `citation_id`\n`corrections/t{threshold}_ranked_titles.csv` | csv | A list of titles, cluster size, and rank by cluster size.\n`corrections/t{threshold}_approx_citation.csv` | csv | The top 50 near-duplicate titles by edit distance for the 20 largest clusters\n`corrections/t{threshold}_edit_distance_stats.csv` | csv | Intercluster edit-distance statistics\n`edit_distance_stats.csv` | csv | Aggregated intercluster edit-distance statistics from all thresholds\n`citation_index.parquet` | parquet | The index of `title_sha` to `citation_id` used for network construction\n`citations.parquet` | parquet | The CORD-19 citation network with deduplication, threshold $t=0.3$\n`citation_pagerank.csv` | csv | A list of citation_ids to pagerank\n\nHere are some datasets that have been obsoleted:\n\ndataset | output type | description \n-|-|-\n`hashed_titles/`  | partitioned parquet | titles that have been shingled and minhashed using `pyspark.ml.feature.MinHashLSH`\n`ann_titles/` | partitioned parquet | a self approximate-similarity join of hashed titles with a Jaccard distance threshold of 0.8\n\n### Changelog\n\n#### 2020-03-23 V24\n* Update title to include deduping\n* removed intermediate spark files to save on space and rely on caching mechanism instead\n* edit distance stats keep top 50 results for the 20 largest clusters. 100 rows is sufficient for quality checks\n* renamed `cord19_citations` to citations\n* include `title_sha` and `num_cited` to titles, for convenience\n\n## Construction\n\nOur goal is to create a `citation_id` by looking at titles in the flattened bibliography. The `sha1` hash of the title alone is not a high quality identifier because titles often contain errors in capitalization or punctuation. We also do not have access to a consistent identifier for all of the citations like a DOI. If we do not correct for these errors, we will miss edges when looking at the number of common neighbors between papers. Proper network construction is important to measures like the [co-citation similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-citation).\n\nInspecting the titles in the bibliography reveals the questionable quality of using them as nodes in a graph:\n\n\n```\nControl of communicable disease manual\nControl of communicable diseases manual\nControl of Communicable Disease Manual\n```\n\nSometimes, papers are referenced in preprint where the title changes after publication. There may also be typesetting errors in the bibliography. We'll cluster titles that are similar and assign them to a single identifier. The ideal choice of identifier would be the most frequent title in the cluster or the title in its most cited form, but we'll settle for the `max(sha1(title))` of the cluster.\n\nWe could calculate the edit distance (Levenshtein distance) between all pairs of titles to determine clusters. Sets of similar titles will get assigned a `citation_id`. However, calculating distances across all pairs will prohibitively expensive (n=1,042,000). We'll accomplish this efficiently using a class of [Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)](http://www.mmds.org/mmds/v2.1/ch03-lsh.pdf) techniques for approximate similarity joins. We deduplicate titles using the [pyspark.ml.feature.MinHashLSH module in Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features#minhash-for-jaccard-distance) and generate a lookup table that can be used against the flattened references.\n\nFinally, we'll actually construct the CORD-19 citation network (`cord19_citations`).\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"! pip install pyspark pyhash networkx\n! ls /kaggle/input/\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession, functions as F\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .config(\"spark.driver.memory\", \"12g\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", spark.sparkContext.defaultParallelism*2)\nspark.conf.get(\"spark.driver.memory\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We're going to reuse some of the results from [Parquet and BigQuery dataset for CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/acmiyaguchi/parquet-and-bigquery-dataset-for-cord-19), which can be found by searching for [`CORD-19 parquet`](https://www.kaggle.com/acmiyaguchi/cord19-parquet) under `+ Add data`.

The exact measurement we will be using is the [Jaccard distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), which is the normalized overlap of two sets.\n\n$$\nd_{J}(A, B) = 1 - \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}\n$$\n\nLooking at the distribution of title lengths above, we see that the mode appears around titles lengths of $2^9$, or 512 characters.

There are limits to the size of a `SparseVector` in the linalg library unfortunately, so we reduce the hash function to a smaller set by taking the modulo of the output.

The second title is strange, which looks to be a somewhat random sequence with variations of the following characters.\n\n```\nGlcNAcb1-4Galb1-4GlcNAcb-Sp8\nGalb1-4GlcNAcb1-6(Fuca1-2Galb1-3GlcNAcb1-3)Galb1-4Glc-Sp21\nGalNAca1-3(Fuca1-2)Galb1-3GalNAcb1-3Gala1-4Galb1-4Glc-Sp21\nMana1-3)Mana1-6(Mana1-3)Manb1-4GlcNAcb1-4GlcNAcb-Sp12\nGalNAcb1-4(Neu5Aca2-8Neu5Aca2-8Neu5Aca2-3)Galb1-4Glcb-Sp0\nFuca1-2Galb1-4GlcNAcb1-2Mana-Sp0\n```\n\nLooking at the 3rd and 4th ranked clusters, the threshold has certainly not been set properly for this to be actionable.\n\n\nAt $t=0.7$, the quality of the largest component at 16.9k nodes is still poor. Looking at the second component with 932 nodes:\n\n```\nRapid and sensitive detection of Taura syndrome virus by reverse ...\nNorth American and European porcine reproductive and respiratory synd...\nPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus antagonizes JAK/ST...\nPorcine reproductive-respiratory syndrome virus infection predisposes pigs...\n```\n\nAt $t=0.6$, the difference between the size of rank 1 and rank 2 component sizes becomes much smaller. However, the tolerance is too high, causing mismatches between titles. From the largest component:\n\n```\nStaphylococcus aureus\nMeticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): screening and decolonisation\nMethicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization in pigs and pig farmers\n```\n\n\n$t=0.3$ is the first where the titles look consistent within their components. A shortcoming of this technique becomes apparent scrolling through the result. Changes in the year or the volume in the references become indistinguishable.\n\n```\n\"The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2010\"\n\"The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2013\"\n\"The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2012\"\n\"The European Union summary report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in (2014)\"\n\"The European Union summary report on trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in (2013)\"\n```"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Constructing the citation network\n\nNow we build the actual citation network."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"! cp corrections/t30_citation_index.parquet citation_index.parquet\ncitation_index = spark.read.parquet(\"citation_index.parquet\")\n\nprint(f\"references:\\t{references}\")\nprint(f\"citation_index:\\t{citation_index}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets double check that the `paper_id` is really the `sha1` of the paper title."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"query = \"\"\"\nwith papers as (\n    select distinct\n        paper_id,\n        paper\n    from\n        references\n)\nselect \n    paper_id = sha1(paper) sha_matches_paper_id,\n    count(*) as num_seen\nfrom\n    papers\ngroup by\n    sha_matches_paper_id\n\"\"\"\nspark.sql(query).show(truncate=False)\n\nquery = \"\"\"\nselect distinct\n    paper_id,\n    sha1(paper)\nfrom\n    references\nlimit 5\n\"\"\"\nspark.sql(query).show(truncate=False)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It turns out that the `sha1(paper)` doesn't match.

The results of the naive citation network are not very relevant, whereas the results of the deduplicated network are useful to the task on hand: finding relevant knowledge in the literature about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n0.

One idea for a future notebook would be to create a citation embedding using a technique such as [node2vec](http://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/) or [Graph Convolutional Networks](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/). Having an embedding would make it easier to incorporate into a recommendation engine. Yet another idea would be to create an author network using LSH for deduplication. The shingling length would likely need to be modified, and perhaps other information like affliation would need to be taken into consideraion.\n\nThere are also quality issues with the network that have not been addressed, such as the inability to distinguish between volumes of journals or small variations in the title. There are also some titles like _\"Submit your next manuscript to BioMed Central and take full advantage of: • Convenient online submission • Thorough ...\"_ that make it into the dataset. However, reducing the citation network above into a co-citation network via an embedding would likely reduce the impact of anomalies like this.\n\nLet me know if this notebook has been helpful to you. I hope this notebook can be of use for addressing the tasks at hand."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
