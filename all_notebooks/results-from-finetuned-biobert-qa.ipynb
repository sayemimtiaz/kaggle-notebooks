some results from using a BioBERT-based question answering system to extract:\n\n    1) DRUG TARGETS for the SARS-CoV-2 virus\n    2) DRUGS Used to treat COVID-19 disease\n    3) RISK FACTORS for COVID-19 disease (outcomes) \n\nWe developed an app which we call ASK COVID ES (Ensemble Sources) to offer a simple interface to pose questions to the \nfine-tuned BioBERT model for it to infer against COVID-19 relevant texts.\n\nThis is based on  the idea of using an ensemble of sources for the use case and then presenting the model \nwith the best results i.e. corpus creation on the fly based on multiple sources using the question posed \nas the starting point for corpus creation. \nThe model is presented with top 500 pertinent articles from the COVID-19 corpus plus top 100 PubMed \narticles and top 50 results from google, now you can basically ask it any question with the caveat \nof potential IP leak (since google and PubMed are also being interrogated).\n\nThe main idea here being if you pose a question that can’t be addressed well by the COVID-19 corpus\nthe other sources google and PubMed could provide missing context.\n\nResponse time is at most 1-2 minutes per question posed.\n\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2nGiwkq.png\" width=\"800\">\n\n\n## Question posed to model: \"what are drug targets for coronavirus?\"\n\n\nmodel saved results to the file
