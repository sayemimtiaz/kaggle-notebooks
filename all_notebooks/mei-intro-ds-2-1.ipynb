You do not have to understand Python programming to use the code but it should give you an appreciation of why code is a useful tool for working with data.\n\nThe activity uses the data from the Edexcel large data set which features weather data for 1987 and 2015 at 8 locations.\n\nThis activity contains additional guidance about how to use notebooks in Kaggle. When using these notebooks you should be able to:\n\n* Run ready-made Python code in the notebook\n* Make changes to the code and see the effects"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### *Using this notebook*\nThis page is a kind of online document called a notebook.
