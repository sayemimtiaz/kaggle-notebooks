Observing the 2-D plots, we could not see a easy division between data and the classifiers confirm that (with the best classifier with a f1-score of 56%). The task of classify the 2-classes dataset was a lot easier and simpler (confirmed by run times of algorithms) and way more assertive (with the two best classifiers with a f1-score of 89%).\n- My Hypothese 1 was wrong, as we saw in two different scenarios. This may be explained by the fact of the dataset doesn't follow simple set of rules, as I expected.\n- My Hypothese 2 was not so wrong, in the end, as we can see in the plot of feature importance in one of the best models of classification (in both scenarios) the Random Forest Algorithm.\n- The one last challenge of try to predict the alcohol levels by the other features was very interesting too, mostly because I could test some regression techniquies."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id='references'>6.
