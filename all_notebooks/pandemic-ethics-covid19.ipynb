China, the epicenter of the pandemic, has the highest reported cases of COVID-19 at more than 80,800 as of March 17, according to worldometer. Italy has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases at nearly 28,000 cases.\n\"Those are not just things, there are expertly trained healthcare workers who man those domains. There just isn't enough of these resources than what we anticipate needing,\"\n\nFour primary ethical challenges in the healthcare sector:\n\n#TREATMENT\n\nWith treatment—we are talking about ICUs, ventilators, and the staff—the purpose is you are trying to save the severely sick. You are trying to save as many of the severely sick as you can.\" Rationing of critical care resources would be jarring for U.S. clinical staff.\nit is entirely feasible that you would be removing people from ventilators knowing that they are going to die. But you remove people from ventilators when your evaluation of the medical situation suggests that patients are not improving. If a patient is not improving,then you try it out on another patient who might have better luck,\" \n\n#TESTING\n\nThe primary purpose of the test is pure public health epidemiology. It's about keeping track of who has COVID-19 in service of trying to limit the spread of the disease to other people. It's about who is more likely to interact with lots of people, or who is more likely to have interacted with more people.\"\n\n#HEALTHCARE WORKERS \n\nThey have a set of obligations that inclines them to go to work when they get the call. On the other hand, healthcare workers have their own interests—they don't want to get sick, which can incline them not to work. There is an `ethical consensus` that healthcare workers have a prima facie duty to work because of everything that has been invested in them, because of their unique position where not just anybody can replace them, because society looks to them to serve this function, and because they went into this profession and are expected to go into work. However, the obligation of healthcare workers to show up for their jobs is not absolute, Tabery says. \"If hospitals don't have personal protective equipment, they are in no position to tell their staff to show up and work. If a hospital cannot provide even a basic level of safety for their employees to do their job, then they are turning their hospital not into a place to treat patients—they are turning it into a hub to exacerbate the problem.\"\n\n#VACCINE\n\nWhen a vaccine becomes available, policymakers, public health officials, and healthcare providers will face rationing decisions until there is sufficient supply to treat the entire population.The first group you are going to want to prioritize are healthcare workers, who are at risk of getting infected by doing their jobs and saving lives. You would also want to prioritize people who serve essential functions to keep society going—the people who keep the water running, the lights on, police, and firefighters. Then you want to start looking at the high-risk groups,\"\n\nChristopher Cheney is the senior clinical care​ editor at HealthLeaders.https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/clinical-care/4-ethical-dilemmas-healthcare-organizations-during-covid-19-pandemic"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQNP_nQM3D8Q82PqZnxjOZjNrXW776c5jAmXLcAgHcdeW-cqOO4',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"seacoast.citymomsblog.com"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata @mpwolke"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
