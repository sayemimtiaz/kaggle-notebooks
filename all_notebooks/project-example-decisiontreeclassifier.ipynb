One problem with our current data is that 'Sex' is categorical, with values of either _male_ or _female_ which are not numbers!\n\nTo use 'Sex' as a feature, we must find a way to encode each category as a number. One Hot Encoding is the most widely used approach for doing this. One Hot Encoding creates new (binary) columns, indicating the presence of each possible category value in the original data. In other words, it separates each of the options for a category into a separate column, where a 1 means that the row fits the category in question and a zero indicates it doesn't.\n\n__For example:__\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mtimFxh.png\" alt=\"One Hot Encoding\" style=\"width:600px\">\n\nWatch this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_4KWmkwmsU) for more information about how and why this works.\n\nThe Pandas __get_dummies__ function is the easiest way to One Hot Encode categorical data.

Consider that if we had even more categories then we'd get even more columns, which could cause performance problems if there are a large number of categories in our data.\n\n# Choose and Train a Model\nNow that we have data our model can digest, let's use it to train a model and make some predictions. We're going to use a __Decision Tree Classifier__ which is different from the Decision Tree Regressor used in the [Intro to Machine Learning course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) in that it makes categorical predictions instead of continuous numerical predictions. \n\nIn this case, the category we want to predict is whether or not a passenger survived, with the output being a 1 if they survived and a 0 if they did not. Decision Tree Classifiers are also able to work with non-numerical prediction targets as well. For example, you might have a 'y' that contains the names (as strings) of different species of flowers. It's only features that need to be encoded.\n\nFor an example of a Decision Tree Classifier working with a non-numerical 'y' and a more in-depth look at how they work, take a look at this Kaggle notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/chrised209/decision-tree-modeling-of-the-iris-dataset)\n\nOk, let's train our model and see what it looks like.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 3 for easy display later on\n# Try changing the max_depth to see what happens\nsurvivor_predictor = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)\n\n# Train the model on the one hot encoded data\nsurvivor_predictor.fit(one_hot_X, y)\n\n# Let's plot the tree to see what it looks like!\nplt.figure(figsize = (20,10))\nplot_tree(survivor_predictor,\n          feature_names=one_hot_X.columns,\n          class_names=['perished', 'survived'],\n          filled=True)\nplt.show()\n\n# Note for class_names we've used strings to represent each of the values.\n# However, the real values are 0 for perished and 1 for survived.\n# Class names for plot_tree must be strings so to get the right replacement values\n# we had to do the following:\n# First get a list of classes the tree will classify things as with the following command\n### print(survivor_predictor.classes_) ###\n# This gives us [0,1] \n# Now we can create a new list with the replacement class strings in the same order.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-02T02:16:13.455353Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-02T02:16:13.455758Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-02T02:16:14.502779Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-02T02:16:13.455717Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-02T02:16:14.501585Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pretty Cool!\nTake a good look at the decision tree. \n- Does the hierarchy of nodes make sense? \n- Are the values used to make decisions what you expected?\n- Is it telling a plausible story about what kind of passengers are more likely to survive?\n- Is there anything that surprises you?\n\nNote that there are other ways to view a decision tree and there may be other parameters you could include when plotting the tree to display the nodes differently, but this is fine for now.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n# Evaluate model performance and tune hyperparameters\nNow that we have a sweet looking model, let's see how good it is at predicting passenger survival on our training set.
