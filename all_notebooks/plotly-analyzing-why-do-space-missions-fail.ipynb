A lot of this has been because of the Space Race between the two countries.  \nHere's an intro to the Space Race taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race)\n> The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), to achieve firsts in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II. The technological advantage required to rapidly achieve spaceflight milestones was seen as necessary for national security, and mixed with the symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race led to pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, uncrewed space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon.\n\n> The competition began in earnest on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \"in the near future\". The Soviet Union achieved the first successful launch with the October 4, 1957, orbiting of Sputnik 1, and sent the first human to space with the orbital flight of Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961. The USSR also sent the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova, to space on June 16, 1963, with numerous other firsts taking place over the next few years with regards to flight duration, spacewalks and related activities. According to Russian sources, these achievements led to the conclusion that the USSR had an advantage in space technology in the early 1960s."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nencoder = LabelEncoder()\nencoder.fit(df['Status Mission'])\ncolors = {0 : 'red', 1 : 'Orange', 2 : 'Yellow', 3 : 'Green'}","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let us see the success and failure percentages of space missions for each of these countries going with the assumption that the Launch Location relates to the Country that was behind the Space Mission, that is to say that if the Launch Location is India, then we can think that all the ergonomics related to the mission were handled by India."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = make_subplots(rows = 4 ,cols = 4,subplot_titles=df['Country'].unique())\nfor i, country in enumerate(df['Country'].unique()):\n    counts = df[df['Country'] == country]['Status Mission'].value_counts(normalize = True) * 100\n    color = [colors[x] for x in encoder.transform(counts.index)]\n    trace = go.Bar(x = counts.index, y = counts.values, name = country,showlegend=False,marker={'color' : color})\n    fig.add_trace(trace, row = (i//4)+1, col = (i%4)+1)\nfig.update_layout(template = 'plotly_dark',margin=dict(l=80, r=80, t=50, b=10),\n                  title = { 'text' : '<b>Countries and Mission Status</b>', 'x' : 0.5},\n                 font_family = 'Fira Code',title_font_color= '#cacaca',height = 1000,width = 1100)\nfor i in range(1,5):\n    fig.update_yaxes(title_text = 'Percentage',row = i, col = 1)\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### We see that in terms of Success Percentages :\n1.

Thus, one thing in clear, **as the technology has advanced, we have been able to do space missions at a lower cost and with lower failure rates.** \n\nThe reason why we see a very high spike in 1987 is because of a **Space Mission by RVSN USSR that has an estimated cost of 5000 million dollars.** Now, that's a lotta money! This skewed the data a lot as most other space missions of that year did not have any Mission Cost listed in the dataset.
