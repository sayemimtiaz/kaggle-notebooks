New York City is home to some of the most impressive educational institutions in the world, yet in recent years, the City’s specialized high schools - institutions with historically transformative impact on student outcomes - have seen a shift toward more homogeneous student body demographics.\n\nPASSNYC uses public data to identify students within New York City’s under-performing school districts and, through consulting and collaboration with partners, aims to increase the diversity of students taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). By focusing efforts in under-performing areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration, we will help pave the path to specialized high schools for a more diverse group of students.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n-------\nPASSNYC and its partners provide outreach services that improve the chances of students taking the SHSAT and receiving placements in these specialized high schools. The current process of identifying schools is effective, but PASSNYC could have an even greater impact with a more informed, granular approach to quantifying the potential for outreach at a given school. Proxies that have been good indicators of these types of schools include data on English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities, Students on Free/Reduced Lunch, and Students with Temporary Housing.\n\n**The Objective of this notebook would be to assess the needs of students by using publicly available data to quantify the challenges they face in taking the SHSAT.And I will try to provide hint or solution to tackle this problem by importing 2 or more datasets **<br><br>\n**Below are the datasets available to us and I have added couple of more datasets for additional insights **"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b2ad0e1850dc0a36c2a1d542e3fdd3df465894f2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#![](https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/05/p-1-5-credibility-busting-responses-you-need-to-stop-using.jpg)\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7c92326591bddf3044da9ed625898c50aebadc7f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Activities I am planning to perform in this kernel **\n--------------------\n**Data Exploration , Feature engineering **\n1.
