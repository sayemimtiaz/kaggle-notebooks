{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ** Infection Among Cancer Patients 2.0**\n\n![](https://sportslogohistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/georgia_tech_yellow_jackets_1991-pres-1.png)\n\n**Executive Summary:** Unsupervised scientific literature understanding system that accepts natural language questions and returns specific answers from the CORD19 scientific paper corpus. The answers are wholly generated by the system from the publicatons cited below the answer. There is also a summary answer of the relevant text and a table with the top 5 articles for ease of scanning.\n\n**APPROACH:**\n- meta.csv is loaded - system uses full text articles where available\n- the natural language questions for the task are contained in a list\n- there is a list of focusing keywords to focus on documents that specifically relate to the topic\n- the natural language questions have the stop words removed for passing to spacy for sentence comparison\n- the full text documents are parsed at sentence level and compared to the question\n- https://spacy.io/usage/vectors-similarity spacy comparison\n- the most relevant sentences are returned in a dataframe and sent to BERT QA and BERT summarizer\n- https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1194/reports/default/15848021.pdf\n- https://pypi.org/project/bert-extractive-summarizer/\n- The question,summary answers and table of relevant scientific papers are returned in HTML format for user review.\n\n**Scientific rigor:** Is the solution evidence based? i.e. does it leverage robust data?  Yes, the solution accesses the Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 59,000 scholarly articles, including over 47,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses.\n\n**Scientific model/strategy:** Did the solution employ a robust scientific method? The solution relies on the underlying scientific documents to provide the scientific model or strategy.  The system learns concepts and topics from a MASS of documents and boils them down for the user to understand answers that are contained in the literature. Obviously the quality of the literature fed to the system will an impact on the relaiability of the asnwers to the questions presented.\n\n**Unique and novel insight** a. Does the solution identify information (new data, features, insights etc) that is yet to be “uncovered?”  Yes, this system provides novel insight to the topics posed realting to cancer.  The biggest advantage is that each week when the CORD19 documents are supplemented with thousdands of new documents, the system can quickly analyze all the documents and revise answers based on new information that has been discovered and reported in the updated documents. \n\n**Market Translation and Applicability** a. Does the solution resolve an existing market need for either an individual, health institution or policy maker? Yes, when any researcher or decision maker wants to understand the broader concepts of any topic and know what is know about specific or even general qustions, the system can quickly and easily review a huge corpus and provide answers to questions that can help humnas focus there analysis or questions.\n\n**Speed to market** a. Does it apply to an existing product vision such as a self assessment tool or policy decision-making tool? Yes the system could easily be scaled to a wed-based system that could be easily impelemented with \n\n**Longevity of solution in market** a. Is the solution one that could be used in various markets through time? Yes, the system can be provided different dcouments and questions and can be repurposed to any research goal such as understanding drug or vaccine targets etc.\n\n**Ability of user to collaborate and contribute to other solutions within the Kaggle community** a. Did the user provide expertise and or resources in the form of datasets or models to their fellow Kaggle members? Yes, I have created and shared about 50 COVID-19 notebooks with Kaggle users. Here is a link to the notebooks I have shared https://www.kaggle.com/mlconsult/notebooks  In addition, my work has been cited on the Kaggle contirbutions page numerous times.
