A lot of factors affect this data. Generally, younger people tend to have a stronger immunity as compared to their elders. Another major reason can be timely lockdowns and declaration of holidays for schools and universities, which significantly reduced the chance of exposure of those in age group 0-19 to the virus. Also, in the northern hemisphere, summer vacations, and in the southern hemisphere, winter vacations were a reason that confined the younger population to their homes, thus reducing the danger for them.\n\n* If we look at the data, the workforce of the population, i.e., people in age groups 20-60 were the worst affected. A major reason for this is that while lockdowns or preventive measures were being initiated, industries, supermarkets and shops were sill in operation. Governments of many countries, in the name of 'saving their economies' didn't pay much attention to the risk the adults were being exposed to. This is the main reason why this outbreak turned into a pandemic.\n\n* Now, if we observe the data for senior citizens, i.e., people in age group 60+, we see that people in age group 60-79 were exposed to the virus on a larger scale as compared to those 80+. The reason here is that people aged 60-80 are more social as compared to those 80+. Most of them retiries, spread their time with friends/acquaintances. As a result, community spread was much more severe in case of this age group. On the contrary, people aged 80+ are usually confined to their homes/old-age(retirement) homes. They are comparatively less social. This is the reson the number of cases in the 80+ age group is relativelty lower.
