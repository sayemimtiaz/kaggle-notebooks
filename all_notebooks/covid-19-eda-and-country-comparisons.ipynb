{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"My initial thoughts on this analyis are based on the information provided by 3Blue1Brown's video here: https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg.\n\nAs I am given to understand, South Korea has undergone a lot of rigourous testing and containment efforts, and so likely is the most ideal model to base actual spread on. Any other countries will have a much wider spread in where they fit based on how much testing they've been doing at any one time.\n\nAdditionally, while the virus will mutate as it spreads, I am assuming that transmissions and mortatlity rates stay roughly the same. \n\n## Recent Updates:\n\n* Jun 15, 2020: Added additional fourier analysis of daily case change.\n* May 14, 2020: Added some Fourier Analysis of the \"new daily fatalities\", there's some recent periodicity on a 6 day scale.\n* April 4th, 2020: Attempt at something other than a flat rate prediction. Didn't work out well. Leaving in until I figure something better. \n* March 31st, 2020: Added a rolling 7 day graph for looking at the number of negative 2nd derivatives. This should hopefully help to tell if things are slowing down. The original graph itself is super noisy, and even looking at a heatmap is a bit of a mess. \n* March 30th, 2020: Changed a couple of graphs to log scale. My US cases are deviating in an exponential way from my inital base-line predictions. (This is good because it's smaller than my base-line). \n* March 26th, 2020: Added a graph and some explanation in the \"predictions\" section. Note: It's not so much predictions as it is a baseline to measure the U.S. doing \"better\" against. \n* March 25th, 2020: Data update. US had a spike on the 19th. Appears to be trending downward from there, which is good news.\n* * Added some addtional predictions based on the median growth rate for the US for the last month. It's depressing, but hopefully we'll start seeing some improvements due to all of the social distancing. \n* March 23rd, 2020: Graphical cleanup and added some percentage change graphs. \n* March 20th, 2020: Updated for latest data, saw jump in US deaths. Creating a separate notebook to analyze that data.\n* March 19th, 2020: Updated code to use alternate dataset. Initial analysis shows a daily differential drop in daily cases and deaths for March 18th in the US. Further investigation ongoing to determine if this is a data processing issue or something else.\n\n## TODO:\n* Get rid of the polynomial prediction and find something that fits better.\n* Add a flat rate sigmoid prediction that follows my original flat rate prediction, but maxes out at the max US population (instead of exceeding it as the flat rate prediction does before the end of April. \n* * Tried this, initial attempt didn't work out well. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt \nfrom matplotlib import dates as mdates\nfrom seaborn import heatmap\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nconfirmed = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_confirmed.csv')\nrecovered = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_recovered.csv')\ndeaths = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_deaths.csv')\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data Cleaning\ndate_cols = confirmed.select_dtypes('int64').columns\n\nsouth_korea = confirmed.loc[confirmed['Country/Region'].str.contains('Korea', case=True)]\nsouth_korea = south_korea.max().to_frame().T.set_index('Country/Region')\nsk_d = deaths.loc[deaths['Country/Region'].str.contains('Korea', case=True)]\nsk_d = sk_d.max().to_frame().T.set_index('Country/Region')\n\n# The other countries I want to look at.\nusa = confirmed.loc[confirmed['Country/Region'] == 'US', :].groupby('Country/Region')[date_cols].sum()\nusa_d = deaths.loc[deaths['Country/Region'] == 'US', :].groupby('Country/Region')[date_cols].sum()\n\nitaly = confirmed.loc[confirmed['Country/Region'] == 'Italy', :].set_index('Country/Region')\nitaly_d = deaths.loc[confirmed['Country/Region'] == 'Italy', :].set_index('Country/Region')\n\ncombined = south_korea.append([usa, italy]).dropna(axis=1)\ncombined.columns = pd.to_datetime(combined.columns)\ncombined = combined.T.sort_index()\n\ncombined_d = sk_d.append([usa_d, italy_d]).dropna(axis=1)\ncombined_d.columns = pd.to_datetime(combined_d.columns)\ncombined_d = combined_d.T.sort_index()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Additional Dataset\nThe following sections are processing an additional dataset to have the newest data to analyze.

The approach here is to use the death rate percentage of South Korea as a model of prediction for the U.S.\n\n### Underlying Assumptions\nThere are a couple of underlying assumptions that may affect the validity of these predictions. Firstly, South Korea appears to be one of the better case scenarios where the spread was able to be contained and properly treated. Additionally, this assumes that the virus has a constant death rate when medical treatement is able to be given to all cases. \n\nIf the virus spread is not properly contained and heath systems are overwhelmed then the death rate should start to significantly rise, at which point these predictions will no longer be valid."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"death_pct = combined_d.astype('float64').div(combined.astype('float64'))\ndeath_pct.plot(title='Fatality percentage')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"death_pct['2020-02-20':].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here are the actual predictions.

The goal is not to have an accurate prediction, but to have a baseline to measure improvement against. Social distancing and closuers didn't really start in the U.S. until the last several weeks. Hopefully, the effects of those closures will be seen in the difference between the two, the third graph.
