The richer the URLs the more the information. URLs like http://example.com/article/12345 provide nothing interesting.\n\nWe first define a function to parse the sitemaps (it is actually taken from [scrapy's code](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/master/scrapy/utils/sitemap.py) with many modifications). \nThis function takes a sitemap URL, goes through all the elements and puts them in a `DataFrame`. It would typically have the columns `\"loc\", \"lastmod\", \"changefreq\", \"priority\", \"alternate\"`, but not necessarily all of them.  \nIf the sitemap happens to be a sitemap index, then it goes through all of the inclcuded sitemaps one by one, and returns everything in one `DataFrame`.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import logging\nfrom xml.etree import ElementTree\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndef sitemap_to_df(sitemap_url):\n    xml_text = urlopen(sitemap_url)\n    tree = ElementTree.parse(xml_text)\n    root = tree.getroot()\n        \n    xml_df = pd.DataFrame()\n\n    if root.tag.split('}')[-1] == 'sitemapindex':\n        for elem in root:\n            for el in elem:\n                if el.text.endswith('xml'):\n                    try:\n                        xml_df = xml_df.append(sitemap_to_df(el.text), ignore_index=True)\n                        logging.info(msg='Getting ' + el.text)\n                    except Exception as e:\n                        logging.warning(msg=str(e) + el.text)\n                        xml_df = xml_df.append(pd.DataFrame(dict(sitemap=el.text),\n                                                            index=range(1)), ignore_index=True)\n\n    else:\n        logging.info(msg='Getting ' + sitemap_url)\n        for elem in root:\n            d = {}\n            for el in elem:\n                tag = el.tag\n                name = tag.split('}', 1)[1] if '}' in tag else tag\n\n                if name == 'link':\n                    if 'href' in el.attrib:\n                        d.setdefault('alternate', []).append(el.get('href'))\n                else:\n                    d[name] = el.text.strip() if el.text else ''\n            d['sitemap'] = sitemap_url\n            xml_df = xml_df.append(pd.DataFrame(d, index=range(1)), ignore_index=True)\n    if 'lastmod' in xml_df:\n        xml_df['lastmod'] = pd.to_datetime(xml_df['lastmod'], utc=True)\n    if 'priority' in xml_df:\n        xml_df['priority'] = xml_df['priority'].astype(float)\n    return xml_df\n\n    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Bloomberg Business Articles Sitemaps\n\nAs an example I'll go through the sitemaps of Bloomberg business articles from 1991 to March 2020.   \nA quick look at their [sitemap index](https://www.bloomberg.com/feeds/businessweek/sitemap_index.xml) reveals that they have a template for their sitemaps as follows: \n`https://www.bloomberg.com/feeds/businessweek/sitemap_{year}_{month}.xml`  \nIt seems that they have a sitemap for each month.
