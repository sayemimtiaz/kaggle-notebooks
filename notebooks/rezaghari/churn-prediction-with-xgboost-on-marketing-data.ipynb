Therefore we will have to define our own churn definition and move on to the modelling.\n\nChurn rate works well for subscription-based products or ones that have regular nature of interactions like Netflix subscription. It’s clear that customer has churned at the moment when he cancels or misses the next planned payment.\n\nWhen we know which customers have churned we can ask them for reasons and prioritize fixes for them. But for not regular, transactional products churn rate is hard to measure since we don’t know which customers are churned and which are dormant.\n\nA generally accepted retail churn rate is between five to sevent percent per year. Less than five percent is a great goal, but a churn rate over ten percent is cause for concern. Even as you acquire more customers, your business can't grow unless you have a greater volume of incoming customers than outgoing ones.\n\nSatisfying existing customers is actually more profitable than obtaining new ones. **It costs five times more to obtain a new customer than it does to retain an existing customer**. Decreasing your churn rate by five percent increases profits up to 125%.\n\nLet's define transactional churn:\n\n**A customer will be considered as churned if not purchased from a store 2 weeks or more.**\n\n2 weeks out threshold is chosen as it splits households around 85%/15% No Churn/Churn."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"out_weeks_threshold = 2\n\n#weekly customer purchase amount\nweekly_purchase = dfs[\"transaction_data\"].groupby([\"household_key\",\"WEEK_NO\"]).sum()[\"SALES_VALUE\"]\nweekly_purchase = weekly_purchase.unstack()\n\n#customer churned by their last 2 week's purchasing behaviour\n#go through all households and calculate out weeks\ntarget = []\ncommon_houses = set(dfs[\"hh_demographic\"].household_key) & set(dfs[\"transaction_data\"].household_key)\nfor house in common_houses:\n  target.append(102-weekly_purchase.loc[house].dropna().index[-1])\n\ntarget = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(common_houses,target)),columns=[\"household_key\",\"No. of Churned Weeks\"])\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nax = sns.distplot(target[\"No. of Churned Weeks\"],kde=False)\nax.axvline(x=out_weeks_threshold,c=\"red\",label=\"Out weeks threshold\")\nax.legend()\nax.set_yscale(\"log\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Frequency (Log)\", fontsize=14)\nax.set_xlabel(\"No. of Churned Weeks\", fontsize=14)\n\nplt.title('Churn Weeks Number', fontsize=17)\n# plt.xlabel('Total Purchases (USD)', fontsize=14)\n# plt.ylabel('Household Key', fontsize=14)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now lets generate our target variable for modelling:\n\n* Churned -> True\n* Not Churned -> False"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"target[\"isChurned\"] = target[\"No. of Churned Weeks\"]>=out_weeks_threshold\ntarget.drop(\"No. of Churned Weeks\",axis=1,inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see how households split with the defined churn:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"target.isChurned.value_counts().plot(kind=\"pie\",autopct=\"%.1f%%\",labels=[\"Non-Churned\",\"Churned\"])\nplt.ylabel(\"\")\nplt.title(\"Churn Variable Distribution\",fontweight=\"bold\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Feature engineering\nLet's generate some features from the \"Campaign Table\", \"Transaction Data\" and \"Coupon Redempt\" tables to be used in the churn prediction model:\n\n**Feature 1**: List of campaigns received by each household:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"household_per_campaign = dfs[\"campaign_table\"].groupby(\"CAMPAIGN\")[\"household_key\"].apply(list)\ntotal_campaigns = len(dfs[\"campaign_table\"].CAMPAIGN.unique())\ndf_camp = pd.DataFrame(np.full((total_households,total_campaigns),0),columns=[\"Camp_\"+str(i) for i in range(1,total_campaigns+1)],\n                                                                                                           index=range(1,total_households+1))\nfor camp in household_per_campaign.index:\n    df_camp.loc[household_per_campaign[camp],\"Camp_\"+str(camp)] = 1\n\ndf_camp[\"household_key\"] = df_camp.index","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Feature 2**: Total number of received campaigns per household:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"temp = dfs[\"campaign_table\"].household_key.value_counts().sort_index()\nno_of_received_campaigns = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(temp.index,temp.values.astype(int))),columns=[\"household_key\",\"no_of_received_campaigns\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nLets see if the \"number\" of campaigns being received affects a household's purchase behaviour.\n\nThe correlation between the number of campaigns received by a household and their total purchase amount is visualised in a scatter plot below.
