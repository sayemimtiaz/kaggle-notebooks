But after each of these events, human kind found a way to bounce back stronger with renewed vigour. \n\nOne key difference between the current pandemic and the previous ones is that we are armed with much better science and data to understand the impending risk and thereby employ ways to mitigate it.\n\nWe definitely are approaching more troubling times over the next couple of months as the data indicates. However countries like China, South Korea and Singapore that were the earliest countries to get affected have shown that with collective effort from both the government and citizens, containment measures can actually succeed. With active government interventions, responsible social behaviour and strict adherence to scientific advice (physical distancing, good hygiene, regular hand washing etc.), we will be able to avoid overwhelming our healthcare systems over the next few months and \"flatten the curve\" globally.  \n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
