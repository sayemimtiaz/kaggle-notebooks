It a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. In essence, it predicts the probability of an observation belonging to a certain class or label. For instance, is this a cat photo or a dog photo?\n\nOrdinary Least Squares linear regression is powerful and versatile right out of the box, but there are certain circumstances where it fails. \n1. it is, expressly, a ‘regression’ framework, which makes it hard to apply as a classifier.\n2. unlike, say, a decision tree, linear regression models don’t perform their own implicit feature selection, meaning they are prone to overfit if too many features are included. \n\nLuckily, there are some extensions to the linear model that allow us to overcome these issues. Logistic regression turns the linear regression framework into a classifier and various types of **`regularization`** of which the `Ridge` and `Lasso` methods are most common, help avoid overfit in feature rich instances.\n\n### **Hypothesis:** \nWe want our model to predict the probability of an observation belonging to a certain class or label. As such, we want a hypothesis $h$ that satisfies the following condition $0 <= h(x) <= 1$ , where $x$ is an observation.\n\nWe define $h(x) = g(w^T * x)$ , where $g$ is a sigmoid function and $w$ are the trainable parameters or `weights`. As such, we have:\n$$h(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-w^Tx}}$$\n\n### The cost for an observation: \nNow that we can predict the probability for an observation, we want the result to have the minimum error. If the class label is $y$, the cost (error) associated with an observation $x$ is given by:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1*vSGnYVz6I7sAObKuxuFAoQ.gif)\n\n### Cost Function: \nThus, the total cost for all the $m$ observations in a dataset is:\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/368/0*vZnp94vCoN0vMDAj)\n\nWe can rewrite the cost function J as:\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/691/0*o57ug0iMGDJVI1qo)\n\nThe objective of logistic regression is to find params `w` so that `J` is minimum. How can we do that?? We will use the gradient descent algorithm to update each of the weights gradually to minimize the cost `J`. \n\nWe will update each of the params wᵢ using the following template:\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*Q6ssvXABrvHUZrfy)\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/496/0*7uVvuW-ZGauNWH_V)\n\nThe above step will help us find a set of params wᵢ, which will then help us to come up with $h(x)$ to solve our binary classification task.\nBut there is also an undesirable outcome associated with the above gradient descent steps. In an attempt to find the best $h(x)$, the following things happen:\n\n**CASE I: For class label = 0**: $h(x)$ will try to produce results as close 0 as possible. As such, $w^T.x$ will be as small as possible\n=> Wi will tend to -infinity\n\n**CASE II: For class label = 1**: $h(x)$ will try to produce results as close 1 as possible. As such, $w^T.x$ will be as large as possible\n=> Wi will tend to +infinity\n\n\n## Regularization:\nRegularization is a technique to solve the problem of overfitting in a machine learning algorithm by penalizing the cost function. It does so by using an additional penalty term in the cost function.\nThere are two types of regularization techniques:\n1. Lasso or L1 Regularization\n2. Ridge or L2 Regularization (We will implement here)\nSo, how can L2 Regularization help to prevent overfitting? Let’s first look at our new cost function:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/628/0*Nc_ocecF0dHpUutK)\n\n\nThe regularization term will heavily penalize large $w_i$. The effect will be less on smaller $w_i$’s. As such, the growth of $w$ is controlled. The $h(x)$ we obtain with these controlled params $w$ will be more generalizable.\n\n**NOTE:** $λ$ is a hyper-parameter value. We have to find it using cross-validation. \n* Larger value $λ$ of will make $w_i$ shrink closer to $0$, which might lead to underfitting. \n* $λ = 0$, will have no regulariztion effect. \n\nWhen choosing $λ$, we have to take proper care of bias vs variance trade-off.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"SIKhL69648U8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"class LogisticRegression(object):\n    \"\"\"\n    Logistic Regression Classifier\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    learning_rate : int or float, default=0.1\n        The tuning parameter for the optimization algorithm (here, Gradient Descent) \n        that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum \n        of the cost function.\n    max_iter : int, default=100\n        Maximum number of iterations taken for the optimization algorithm to converge\n    \n    penalty : None or 'l2', default='l2'.\n        Option to perform L2 regularization.\n    C : float, default=0.1\n        Inverse of regularization strength;
