{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# AUC Scoring Quirk\n\nWith Kaggle's AUC metric it is [impossible to score less than 0.25][2] - predictions with lower AUC than that are inverted with 1-score, so 0.2 becomes 0.8 and 0.1 shows as 0.9 etc.\n\nThis kernel selects all AUC competitions and plots every submission for each as Public LB vs Private LB score - these scores should be very correlated.\n\nHowever - the plots have outliers: it seems the inversion is applied **separately** to public and private scores.\n\nThis means it is possible to score ~0.25 on one leaderboard and ~0.75 on the other.\n\nSome of the competitions have a random public/private test set split - so it should not be possible to have such divergent scores. From a users' perspective, we submit one set of predictions, they should not be treated differently for each of the public/private subsets.\n\nThis has so far had a fairly small impact; competitions with top scores under 0.75 cannot be affected, but those with higher scores may be, and occasionally this has lead to large shake-up for individual teams (albeit in the bottom half of the LB).\n\nIf a competition with a score ceiling of 0.76 is launched it could cause a lot more confusion :)\n\nIt's most noticeable on the most recent AUC competition [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection][1].\n\nKudos to Kaggle for making the raw data available to see this in such detail :)\n\n### Color Scheme\n - gray: not used for either leaderboard\n - blue: used as public LB entry for team\n - red: used as private LB entry for team\n - purple: used as public and private LB entry for team\n \n### Suggestions to Kaggle:\n - Invert both scores or neither.\n - Always inform the user whether the score is true or inverted.\n - Invert at 0.5 (some libraries do this).\n\nChanging the threshold to 0.5 would potentially propel some teams from just over 0.25 to just under 0.75, slightly affecting ranking & points. Some stats are listed per competition to see the effect.\n\n### Alternatively:\n - Do not invert at all, reject submissions with scores under 0.5\n - Do not invert at all, but warn participants to look at the bottom of the LB.\n - Do not invert scores, but add 'ghost' LB entries for submissions with low AUC, showing where they appear if inverted.\n \nAre there other possibilities?
