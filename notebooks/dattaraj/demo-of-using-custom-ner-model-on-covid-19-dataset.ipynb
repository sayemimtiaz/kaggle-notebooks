Feedback most welcome!**\n\nExtracting structured information from unstructured text such as EHRs and medical literature has always been a challenging task. Recent advancements in machine learning take advantage of the large text corpora available in scientific literature as well as medical and pharmaceutical web sites and train systems which can be leveraged for several NLP tasks ranging from text mining to question answering. Along with progress in the research space, there has been significant progress in the libraries and tools available for industry use. We will use a custiom trained NER model to identify entities like Chemical, Symptom, Dosage, Disease - use these entities to show prevelance from the released dataset.\n\nBased on our paper at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11241\n\nDataset available at: https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research\n\nBy Dattaraj J Rao (Persistent Systems) - https://www.linkedin.com/in/dattarajrao\n\n![COVID-19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Covid-19-4855688_640.png)"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# install required packages - we will use sciSpacy\n!pip install -U spacy > silent.txt\n!pip install scispacy > silent.txt\n!pip install https://med7.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/en_core_med7_lg.tar.gz > silent.txt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### We will use a named entity recognition (NER) model to extract entities like Drug from the text based on sentence structure.
