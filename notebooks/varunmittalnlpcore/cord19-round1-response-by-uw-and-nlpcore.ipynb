These topics could be dictionary terms such as Proteins, Cell Lines or user specified such as (Host Cells, Viruses) or dynamically extracted by the search engine based upon search terms.\n\n \n\nThe objective of the project is to provide most relevant and specific references (not just articles but specific sentences with-in each article) along with relevant biological materials as a response for the questions posed in this challenge. Our goal is to enable life sciences researchers to quickly gather, triage and identify most applicable subset of candidate proteins and/or reagents for their experiments related to Covid-19 research.\n\n \n\nBesides extracting references, we also validated search results against LitCovid (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) an expertly curated set articles on Covid-19 and found both good matches as well as data set anomalies. We have provided this reproducible validation test scripts along with the dataset in an accompanying Jupyter notebook available at https://www.kaggle.com/varunmittalnlpcore/litcovid-validation. For optimal performance, we highly recommend users to download both of these notebooks and run locally on their personal workstations. Publically hosted environments such as Kaggle and Google Collab have resource limitations that may severely impact performance and limit functionality.\n\n \n\nFinally we provide visualizations that show distribution and correlation of results - both through sample code in this notebook as well as click-through URLs to our Search Portal, to help researchers sift through results and narrow them down to a more relevant subset for their experiments or further investigations.\n\n \n\n## Background\n\nVarun Mittal - cofounder at NLPCORE, is a University of Washington alumni with Masters CS degree in AI and ML techniques and has remained as faculty support for Prof. Dr. Ka Yee Yeung at UW, who is conducting its TCSS592 class this spring. This CORD19 challenge together with expertly curated Covid-19 datasets have provided a unique opportunity for both UW TCSS592 class students and NLPORE team to work together under guidance of Dr. Ka Yee.\n\n \n\nNLPCORE is a knowledge discovery platform powered by its unique AI and ML techniques (US Patents:  [#10102274](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10102274B2) & [#10372739](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190005049A1)) that delivers contextual and actionable results for users across various verticals – life sciences, case law, patents, insurance and more.\n\n \n\n![Identify Entities and Relationships using Part of Speech tags](https://i.imgur.com/dXT19EW.png)\n\n \n\nIts search technology collects statistics such as word frequencies, offsets as well as part of speech tags (e.g. noun, pronoun, or verb) in its index. Words that appear most frequently and closest to the search keyword(s), provide seed articles for its neural-net algorithms that also factor in heuristics, dictionaries and in-place user-feedback. For any given search keyword(s), its search engine scans across all matching articles deploying a (Hadoop like) cluster of processing nodes to identify and retrieve the most appropriate concepts, their grouping into meaningful topics, their relationships to each other and their specific annotated references from the entire text corpus.\n\n \n\nIn this project submission, we used both the dataset provided as well as the open-access subset from NIH (pubmed central) to focus on all coronavirus related research and extract related content from both existing and newly available research. Furthermore for validation, we used expertly curated LitCovid dataset that we have enclosed as additional datasets along with this submission for reproducibility.\n\n \n\n## Extracting, Analyzing and Presenting Results\n\nIn order to respond to challenge questions, we submitted a number of search keywords to NLPCORE along with suggested topics to extract based upon students' research and suggestions. We collected these results i.e. concepts, topics and their joint references into DataFrames. We then experimented with a number of concept/link attributes such as frequency of terms or co-occurrences, distance of these terms from searched keywords, their part of speech tags (mostly pronouns, nouns or verbs), topics they belong to, etc. as way to filter the DataFrames to the most meaningful subset. We then present the output along with individual text references (Article Ref, Title, Section Title, Surrounding Sentences) in recommended table format that can be readily exported as a CSV file and consumed by the researchers for their further analysis and experimentation.\n\n \n\n## Validating Results\n\nAs part of extracting results down to specific phrases (topics and concepts), we also compared research articles that contained these phrases against expertly curated dataset. To do so, we validated search results against LitCovid (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) an expertly curated set. We found both good matches as well as data set anomalies (when using our search engine and CORD-19 dataset versus using our search engine and LitCovid dataset). We have provided this reproducible validation test scripts along with the dataset in an accompanying Jupyter notebook available at https://www.kaggle.com/varunmittalnlpcore/litcovid-validation. For optimal performance, we highly recommend users to download both of these notebooks and run locally on their personal workstations. Publically hosted environments such as Kaggle and Google Collab have resource limitations that may severely impact performance and limit functionality. The notebook contains both the datasets and scripts that were used to perform the comparison for reproducibility. We found that in cases where we were able to uniquely identify articles with proper identity (such as Pubmed or PMC ID) - both in the curated set and that used by our search engine, we had a high degree of match but when the dataset lacked a matching identification for the articles, our matches decreased significantly.\n\n \n\n## Visualization of Results\n\nWe also provided sample scripts in this notebook as well as a blog post at our website (see references below) to help researchers visualize the results for easy categorization and filtering. To this end, we provide a grouping of results by various topics and ability to drill-down to results with-in a topic. We also provide one-click access URLs that allow users to access these results at our Search Portal as well where they can further explore results with various filters and visual representations.\n\n \n\n## Reusability of our Approach\n\nThe methodology and approach that we have taken to respond to this challenge as well as to validate our search results is very easily extensible by virtue of user-defined topics in NLPCORE search engine. Besides search terms, we force the search engine to look for cluster of most relevant words (concepts) for one or more user-defined topics and therefore go above and beyond simple text or regular expression matches to identify articles and references with-in them (hit highlighting) containing these concepts. One has to simply change the list of user-defined topics and search terms to extract references and articles for any specific use case and text corpus.\n\n \n\n## Use of cache & pre-computed results\n\nOur notebooks have used cached results and reused pre-computed results both for reproducibility and more importantly as a work-around for resource limitations be it CPU usage, memory usage and network bandwidth (for web API calls) enforced by publically hosted Jupyter Notebook platforms including Kaggle and Google Collab. We therefore recommend that users download these notebooks, make changes at will and execute them locally.\n\n \n\n## References\n\n1.

We continue to further our engagements with life sciences researchers, help them apply results from our technology (that remains available to research community at no cost) for their experiments and identify areas of further improvements in our toolset.\n\n \n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe at NLPCORE acknowledge Prof. Dr. Ka Yee Yeung and her class of TCSS592 along with our intern and MIT freshman Yos Wagenmans who contributed immensely to research for and prepare this submission.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Tasks Attempted\nFor round 1, we have attempted to respond to following CORD-19 challenges.\n\n* Task 1: What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?\n* Task 2: What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?\n* Task 3: What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?\n* Task 4: What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?\n\nFor each task, we took the key phrases (mostly unique words) from the description of the task itself and forced our search engine to search the neighborhood of these words together with mention of coronavirus itself in the literature and extracted the most frequent concepts, biomaterials (proteins and cells) and their combined references in articles.
