Our knowledge graph approach emphasizes scientific results and findings over basic medical knowledge due to our use of an \"efficacy valence\" approach, which we describe below. \n\n### How to Use this Widget: The \"CORE_RESULTS\" option in the drop-down menu displays our main findings. Use the drop-down menu to explore the connections related to other relevant biomedical entities.\n\n### Data: The above knowledge graphs use only articles in bioXriv and medRxiv, two of the preprint archives provided for this challenge, due to the long runtimes associated with larger datasets.\n\n### Methods: Our approach uses a novel algorithm intended to create connections that result from scientific findings (\"this study indicates that drug X leads to medical outcome Y\") rather than background knowledge (\"drug X and drug Y have been used to treat condition  Z\"). We accomplish this novel weighting scheme by using \"efficacy valence\" scores, a numerical score of the extent to which a statement emphasizes the creation of novel knowledge. We further explain our approach and methodology below.\n\n#### Run the code above to see the cached results that were created by this notebook earlier.

Unlike supervised machine learning tasks such as object detection, there is no objective, universal ground truth for a knowledge graph. There are some theoretical possibilites though. One method for evaluating a knowledge graph might be to interview actual persons, experts or non-experts, and ask whether the knowledge graph accurately represents that person's understanding of a phenomenon or even reveals new knowledge. \n\nWe took a more modest approach. We had one team member who did not work on the graphing algorithm select a reputable survey of COVID-19-related drugs and manually create a knowledge graph. We could then compare our algorithmically-derived results to this manually-created knowledge graph. Our manually-created knowledge graph is below:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Our target graph from our external literature survey, to validate our results:\")\n\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(\"../input/goalgraph/goal.png\")\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our own assessment (and you should never have a student grade themself) is that our computer-generated knowledge graphs did suprisingly well at discovering the links present in this hand-crafted knowledge graph. Our knowledge graph found most, if not all, all of the therapeutics that appeared in this custom knowledge graph (see below). We should mention, however, that the two drugs our knowledge graphs did not find never appeared the raw article dataset. We view this as a limitation of the source data and not the algorithm. \n\nAlthough we did not formally present 'interleukin-6' in our result graph, we did mine the word 'cytokine,' which is a superclass of this and other interleukins. Similarly, assuming that the importance in the goal graph of plasma as a therapeutic stems from its ability to deliver antibodies, our graph returns serum, which, as we understand it, is the same as plasma, but without fibrogens (clotting material).\n\nSimilarly, the Kaggle challenge task itself mentions the drugs naproxen, clarithromycin, and minocycline, however, the first two didn't occur in any paper in the biorxiv dataset provided (we only used these papers), while minocycline was mentioned just twice (in the same sentence with many other drugs), making it almost impossible for our algorithm to tease out that this particular drug (and not others in the sentence, which we did report on), happened to be relevant. As for the remaining drugs, all but one (favipiravir) of them appeared in our CORE_RESULTS main graph, with favipiravir being the only drug that appeared only in one or more of the flyout graphs instead.\n\nIn addition to finding all the drugs in our goal, we were able to find 18 additional drugs that may be relevant treatment options for Covid19!\n\nWe used this literature review, specifically the sub-section on \"investigational approaches.\"\n\nKenneth McIntosh, Martin S Hirsch, Allyson Bloom, \"Coronaviruses,\" Uptodate.com, https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronaviruses, accessed April 5, 2020.\n\n# Pros and cons of this approach\n\nOur methodology for intelligently choosing edges based on efficacy valence is going to be far superior to simpler text mining approaches that look for word frequency and other statistical-based approaches. The resultant graph we achieved provides a relatively simple, but highly complete picture of the current landscape of available theraputics and drugs. We also specifically focus of biomedical Named Entity Recognition by using MeSH keywords and drug databases to mine topics.\n\nThere are two limitations we face: the first is time; it takes several hours, even if you have a GPU and parallelize multiple CPUs, to generate this graph (which is why we uploaded cached versions of our results). We envision a world where a researcher would probably run this code daily. \n\nWe also, with more time, could have more intelligently performed word stemming, tokenization, and other basic NLP hygiene, but found that our results exceeded our expectations. We also could have applied more sophisticated Named Entity Recognition approaches to reduce a dependency on the need to update MeSH and drug keywords whenever they come out by using tools like BioBERT.\n\nOur second limitation is that we did not have time to attempt any text summarization into English sentences for each of the drugs. We anticipate that other research groups that have focused on this sort of thing could be tasked with developing such a module, which could be attached to our graph and provide more detailed information for each treatment we identify.\n\n# Next steps\n\nAt the bottom of this notebook, we repeat the code for generating the knowledge graph, and include a display that will return all the papers and relevant sentences, along with their efficacy valence score, that were used to generate the knowledge graph. A researcher can then feed these papers and/or the relevant sentences into another tool that performs elegant text summarization, which was not the focus of our project."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analytical Method\n\nThe code we used to conduct this analysis and generate the knowledge graphs above can be found below.\n\n## Note on running the notebook yourself\n\n### Cached versions versus running from scratch\n\nDue to the size of the dataset, we've provided three options in the cell below for you to choose how you want to run this notebook:\n1. \"cached\": Run a cached version that we have uploaded, which generates edges from the entire biorxiv_medrxiv dataset as of 4/11/2020. This will recreate the graph you saw above. This should take about fifteen minutes (most of the time is for automatically installing libraries, dependencies, and training a BERT model for sentence efficacy valence).\n2. \"mini\" : Run a mini version, which shows you a proof-of-concept on two articles from the dataset. This takes about as long to run as above.\n3. \"full\" : Run a full version, on a dataset of your choice. This can take a few hours or longer, depending on your hardware.\n\n### Requirements and runtime\n\nIn order to process thousands of articles, it is best if you have access to multiple CPU cores, and at least one GPU. If you are just running a cached version of this notebook, a single CPU will suffice. \n\n### Running options\n\n1. **Using paper abstracts**: Besides choosing which dataset to run on (cached, mini, or full), you can also specify if sentences should be pulled from the paper abstracts; right now, we have turned this option off, because it adds to the runtime.\n2. **Choosing a different edge weighting** : Currently, edge weighting is done using the efficacy valence model we built. You can also choose to weight edges by paper citation count, by weighting edges based on how many \"interesting words\" are in the sentence (we define this later in the notebook), or a custom combination of all three.

To do so, we have to prepare the sentences in the edges to feed into a state-of-the-art NLP model we describe in more detail later.\n\nIn the cell below, we convert a sentence such that every keyword/NER is replaced with the string \"VOID\". We do this because of how we train our efficacy valence model: we want it to learn what sentences have more \"academic merit\" and \"novelty\" than others, but we don't want it to accidentially learn relationships about specific diseases, drugs, or other topics. Therefore, we attempt to cross out all these keywords and replace them with VOID instead, so our model can focus on the grammar and other words in the sentence. In theory, our efficacy model aims to be disease and treatment agnostic.\n\nThe code below is not parallelized, and can take a few hours to run on the full dataset.

Edge labelling: Using BERT (state-of-the-art NLP tool) to predict the \"efficacy valence\" of sentences in academic articles\n\n## TLDR: The code below labels each sentence in our dataset with how likely it is to contain experimental results, as opposed to background or commonly-known facts.\n\n## Background\n\nWe would like to weight the nodes in our graph by how much \"academic merit\" and \"novelty\" exists in the sentence they came from. For example, in an academic paper, giving a background fact such as \"The flu kills thousands of people a year.\" is less interesting for our purposes than an experimental results such as \"Our study demonstrates that drug ABC was more effective at reducing symptoms than drug XYZ, but with fewer side effects.\" You can think of this as 'sentiment analysis' (like judging if a movie review is positive or negative), but for deciding how useful a sentence from an academic paper is for knowledge engineering.\n\nWe want to be able to use the underlying grammatical structure of sentences, the context of words, as well as the words themselves to build a predictive model that can label a sentence with a likelihood of containing a useful fact (so assign a 0 or 1). We call the concept of a useful academic fact or outcome as \"efficacy valence.\"\n\n## Modeling Efficacy Valence by training a BERT model\n\nBERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a state-of-the-art NLP tool that can be used to generate rich embeddings of sentences, to be used in downstream NLP tasks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model). You can use BERT to generate features to feed into a classifier, among many other tasks. In our case, we'll train BERT to generate features/word-embeddings that we can then feed into a binary classifier that labels the source sentence as useful (1) or not useful (0).\n\n## BERT code (below)\n\nThe code below uses an open source sentiment analysis BERT model that we fine-tuned for our dataset. The original code tried to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. We made minor changes to the code base, to fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on our sentences and labels, rather than movie reviews.\nhttps://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/predicting_movie_reviews_with_bert_on_tf_hub.ipynb"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.1 Edge labelling: training the BERT model on our sentences\n\nTo train BERT, we needed sentences that were labelled by their human-judged utility; we then simply feed these sentences into a pre-trained BERT model (available for download), and fine-tune BERT on our particular task. We obtained ~1000 training sentences by manually going through example sentences from the PolySearch database for diseases we thought were similar to covid19, such as sars, mers, influenza, hiv, malaria, and others, and manually labelling them on a 1-4 scale ('negative', 'neutral', 'weak positive', and 'strong positive'). Some examples are below:\n* Strong positive: The results showed that VOID significantly induced VOID expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the VOID. \n* Weak positive: The results showed that VOID could up-regulate VOID expression time- and dose- dependently in VOID.\n* Neutral: VOID has been persistent in the VOID VOID since 2012. \n* Negative: The efficacy of VOID fortification against VOID is uncertain in VOID-endemic settings. \n\nFor binary classification, we converted these scores into positive or not positive.\n\nWe used 900 out of the 1000 samples to train the model, reserving the rest for evaluation. On our evaluation set, our trained model had an F1-score of 94% and an AUC of 93% -- not bad at all given how little time we had! Not terribly surprsing either, given how powerful BERT is compared to other word-embeddings, and that we feel that the task of deciding efficacy valence isn't a particulary difficult one from an NLP perspective. Once we trained BERT on our labelled dataset, we could then label all the sentences we mined thusfar on this Covid19 dataset.\n\n### Training runtime\n\nTraining the BERT model below on a GPU takes less than 3 minutes.
