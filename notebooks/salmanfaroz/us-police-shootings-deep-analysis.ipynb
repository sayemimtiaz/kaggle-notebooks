Updated estimates from the Bureau of Justice Statistics released in 2015 estimate the number to be around 930 per year, or 1,240 if assuming that non-reporting local agencies kill people at the same rate as reporting agencies.\n\nDeaths by age group in 2015, according to The Counted\nAround 2015–2016, The Guardian newspaper ran its own database, The Counted, which tracked US killings by police and other law enforcement agencies including from gunshots, tasers, car accidents and custody deaths. In 2015 they counted 1,146 deaths and 1,093 deaths for 2016. The database can be viewed by state, gender, race/ethnicity, age, classification (e.g., \"gunshot\"), and whether the person killed was armed.\n\nThe Washington Post has tracked shootings since 2015, reporting more than 5,000 incidents since their tracking began. The database can also classify people in various categories including race, age, weapon etc. For 2019, it reported a total of 1,004 people shot and killed by police.\n\n<a id=\"top\"></a>\n\n<div class=\"list-group\" id=\"list-tab\" role=\"tablist\">\n<h2 class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\" data-toggle=\"list\" style='background:; border:0' role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"home\"><center>Topics</center></h2>\n\n* [1.
