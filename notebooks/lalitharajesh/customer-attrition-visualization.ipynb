Every business is keen to know the reasons behind the customers who left and mainly it becomes a important task to atleast retain the existing customers. Than implemeting plans to new customer, it is the existing customer who can generate additional customer referrals. \n\nCustomer retention can be achieved with good customer service and products. But the most effective way for a company to prevent attrition of customers is to truly know them. The vast volumes of data collected about customers can be used to build churn prediction models. Knowing who is most likely to defect means that a company can prioritise focused marketing efforts on that subset of their customer base. Preventing customer churn is critically important to the telecommunications sector, as the barriers to entry for switching services are so low.\n\nIn this Kernel, we will examine the following:\n-  a) What are all the factors behind the people who left the company\n-  b) customer data  with the aim of building and comparing several customer churn prediction models. \n\n\n***Kindly Upvote if anyone finds this kernel helpful. I also request you to provide suggestions to strengthen the kernels purpose.***"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"86a222bdbd58a178aa4001ae78358c42d5a58fce"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is a binary (2-class) classification problem.
