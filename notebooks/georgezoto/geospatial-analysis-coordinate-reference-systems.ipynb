In your research, you discover that these birds typically spend the summer breeding season in the eastern United States, and then migrate to South America for the winter.  But since this bird is under threat of endangerment, you'd like to take a closer look at the locations that these birds are more likely to visit.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qQcS0KM.png\" width=\"1000\"><br/>\n</center>\n\nThere are several [protected areas](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about) in South America, which operate under special regulations to ensure that species that migrate (or live) there have the best opportunity to thrive.  You'd like to know if purple martins tend to visit these areas.  To answer this question, you'll use some recently collected data that tracks the year-round location of eleven different birds.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/styles/graphics/public/content/images/global_map_of_pas_wcmc_2016.jpg?itok=uY3qxTWI\" width=\"1000\">\n\nBefore you get started, run the code cell below to set everything up."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nfrom shapely.geometry import LineString\n\nfrom learntools.core import binder\nbinder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.geospatial.ex2 import *","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exercises\n\n### 1) Load the data.\n\nRun the next code cell (without changes) to load the GPS data into a pandas DataFrame `birds_df`.
