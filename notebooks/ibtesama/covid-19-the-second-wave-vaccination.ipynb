Restrictions were substantially eased over the summer and into early autumn. Subsequently, as the weather cooled in September, people returned indoors to bars, restaurants, offices, and homes where the virus could easily spread.*\n* For all of these countries the second wave caused way more infections than the first wave and for some countries like France and Poland, cases during the first wave are almost negligible in comparison.\n* Turkey's second wave came in late November, a little later than in other countries. After a decline later in January, the cases started increasing again in March and are still on the rise. The daily new cases in April are twice it's peak during December.Turkey possibly has a third wave. \n* The same goes for Germany, after the second wave subsided in February , the daily new cases are reaching a new peak again.\n* Portugal on the other hand is a country, that brutally got hit by the virus during the second wave. After the peak in late January , the country has managed to bring back it's daily cases to as few as 200-300.\n* UK follows a curve similar to Portugal. Although, the number of cases are much higher due to the country's population. The second wave started around late September. It is also worth noting that the highest recorded daily cases(peak) in UK was on January 8 2021 with 67,928 cases while for France it was on November 7 2020 with 88,790 cases.
