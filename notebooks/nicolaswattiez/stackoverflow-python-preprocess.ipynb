You may choose to not remove Stopwords or Lemmatize your text in some case.\nThe **ORDER** of these steps may also vary. Make some spelling correction or lemmatization BEFORE removing StopWords may change the result.\nAlso, note that these steps are far from being optimised (I tokenize, untokenize, then tokenize again, etc.).  \nYou may also have heard of the expression \"Text normalization\". This is another step in NLP but it redundant with Noise removal. Those two are not well-defined and are overlapping. So I choose to organise my preprocess only with Noise removal in this case (which is completely arbitrary and it's fine).  \nFinaly, I did not include the removing of punctuation, special character and number in the Noise removal step since, it's more interessting to have this step as an independant step. The data are about programming and in programming, we use a lot of special character. So you may want to not remove those characters. Also, it make the preprocess clearer. We begin with cleaning, then we remove character (the most basic unit when working with text), after that we move to the word unit and finaly, we normalize the word.
