Further in each of the four regions few states have higher market share than others by large margin. Apart from having large urban centers, favourable business environment may also be factor for ex: lower taxes, state grants in establishing new stores, less stringent labor laws etc**  \n\n* **At National level, California, Texas, Ohio, Florida and Indiana are top states attracting most of the businesses**\n\n## Brand Presence\n* **Top Brands have presence in almost all geographies with McDonalds having more stores than others by a considerable margin. This tells us that key growth strategy for Brands has been \"Market Development\" i.e offer products/services in newer markets as a way to grow revenues**  \n* **McDonalds share is above 30% in all regions followed by Burger King at 17-24%**\n* **Given the ubiquitous presence of brands, there is intense stiff competition in market. This creates added pressure on Brands to differentiate their product offerings which opens up opportunities for Brands to leverage their strengths while others face headwinds if they don't adapt in time. In market charecterized by high volume-low margin transactions mere survival may not be best long term strategy**\n\n## Health Inspection Results\n* **Lack of Ventilation, Cleanliness of non food surfaces, food storage and maintenance, Insects and Rodents presence are health codes which are violated often**   \n\n* **In Los Angeles City KFC, McDonalds and Subway are responsible for most violations per store while in Chicago it's McDonalds, Burger King and KFC which fall foul of standards** \n* **McDonalds and KFC are both failing to meet set standards indicating that they are having trouble in managing their store operations. In addition they may be facing risk of store closures if this trend persists**  \n\n* **Frequent fines and penalities erode profit margins and can hurt business**\n\n## Yelp Rating Analysis\n* **McDonalds, Burger King and KFC have many negative reviews relative to positive ones suggesting that customers are quite dissapointed with their service**  \n* **Further analysis of reviews at store level should highlight key problems affecting the business**\n* **This also shows that issues plaguing in running day to day store operations are having an affect on customer experience which may sound the death knell of Brand if not controlled immediately**\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# !jupyter nbconvert --execute --to html FastFoodRestaurantsMarketAnalysis.ipynb\n# !jupyter nbconvert  FastFoodRestaurantsMarketAnalysis.ipynb --to html\n\n!jupyter nbconvert --to html FastFoodRestaurantsMarketAnalysis.ipynb","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
