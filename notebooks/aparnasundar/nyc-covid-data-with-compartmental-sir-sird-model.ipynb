With vaccines still being developed, specfic treatment still at the experimental stage, and limited testing capacity in much of the world, \"social distancing\" has emerged as the prevailing method of containment. Epidemiologic models used by public health officials have played a major role in convincing goverments to adopt this method. <br> <br> In this notebook, we first visualize the spread of Covid-19 in NYC by looking at the new case rate, hospitalization, and death rate as well as look at cumulative counts of the same and finally how they differ by gender, and age. <br>\n\nThen we look at metrics on how much New Yorkers have heeded these calls to social dispancing in the timeframe for which we visualised the Covid impact. <br> \n\nFinally, we fit some simple compartmental models such as SIR, and
