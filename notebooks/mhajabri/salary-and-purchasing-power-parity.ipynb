This happens in a much larger scale when changing countries !      \nLet's take an example : Consider 1 USD, Google tells you that it equals 64.92 Indian Rupee. An average dinner in the US may cost you 10-12 USD which corresponds to 640-760 INR. But in fact, it appears that you could get yourself a good meal with 150-200INR in India. In other words : **You can do with 1USD in India more than what you would do with 1USD in the US.**\n\nAs a basic example, let's say we find that 1USD in India = 3USD in the US, that would mean that if you get paid 3000 USD in India you would lead the same someone would be leading in the US if he's getting paid 9000 USD.\n\nHere comes the **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP from now on)** : Faced with this problematic of different costs of livings, economists came up with a ratio to convert currencies without using market exchange rates. To do so, they select a **basket of goods**, say orange/Milk/tomato ..., and check its value in the USD and in the country they're interested in.     \nLet's say they find that : \n* Value of the basket in the US = 10 USD\n* Value of the basket in India = 200 INR        \n\nThen they would say that **PPP(India) = 200/10 = 20**, in other words, you need 20 local currency units to get what you would get with 1 USD in the US.   \n\nAll in all,* The purchasing power of a currency refers to the quantity of the currency needed to purchase a given unit of a good, or common basket of goods and services.*","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e9a15a1e-8b06-491c-9795-f8493326b8b1","_uuid":"838f5173a6ec1815220666507f60435e4b62a008"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Kagglers incomes adjusted according to PPPs","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"93a1ee46-5ee2-44d9-9f52-a04f58cb564c","_uuid":"dc387fcbe27e2c07fdd61f31350459995f715197"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"In the following, we'll convert the incomes using the PPP rates and see what happens for different countries.      \nTo get significant results, we'll only keep countries from where at least 80 respondents gave their income informations.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"90f96ec5-a66d-4b4f-9e0e-95df01560037","_uuid":"e0b832e5b37ab98d69b193e7a931caf2e03cd65f"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\n\n#We convert the salaries to numerical values and keep salaries between 1000 and 2.000.000 Local currency\ndata['CompensationAmount'] = data['CompensationAmount'].fillna(0)\ndata['CompensationAmount'] = data.CompensationAmount.apply(lambda x: 0 if (pd.isnull(x) or (x=='-') or (x==0))\n                                                       else float(x.replace(',','')))\ndf = data[(data['CompensationAmount']>1000) & (data['CompensationAmount']<2000000)]\n\n\n#We only keep the countries with more than 100 respondents to get significant results later on\ns_temp = df['Country'].value_counts()\ns_temp = s_temp[s_temp>80]\ncountries=list(s_temp.index)\ncountries.remove('Other')\ndf=df[df.Country.isin(countries)]\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_cell_guid":"822e2ebd-1162-415c-9636-7ca3be6493ed","_uuid":"8187f65677884f92d822a0d5e562783dc774c723"},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43},{"source":"We have some missing values in the Currency column.    \nWe won't drop the rows with missing values, instead, we'll fill them with the currency of the country the respondent lives in, here's the code to do so : ","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dc80fc31-71d3-480b-bff5-c93dbb2826e1","_uuid":"75a7d81890f082cef376361e40660334f29d7c3a"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"df['CompensationCurrency'] =df.groupby('Country')['CompensationCurrency'].apply(lambda x: x.fillna(x.value_counts().idxmax()))","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"98e95a67-99b4-460d-98a0-2c77c32d9d31","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"6d300776ec180eff4a404776a90af1646772fb70"},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":44},{"source":"Now, we'll provide PPP rates for the countries we kept earlier.\n> I tried to use the latest PPP rates available, you can found the PPP for each country [here](http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPEX@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/IND).","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"46dee4e4-c140-41d1-80be-70aeb8efce3f","_uuid":"03d03f50c1fccba626bf3abf0e18103c6afa73d8"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"#The PPP rates\nrates_ppp={'Countries':['United States','India','United Kingdom','Germany','France','Brazil','Canada','Spain','Australia','Russia','Italy',\"People 's Republic of China\",'Netherlands'],\n           'Currency':['USD','INR','GBP','EUR','EUR','BRL','CAD','EUR','AUD','RUB','EUR','CNY','EUR'],\n           'PPP':[1.00,17.7,0.7,0.78,0.81,2.05,1.21,0.66,1.46,25.13,0.74,3.51,0.8]}\n\nrates_ppp = pd.DataFrame(data=rates_ppp)\nrates_ppp\n","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7959be49-4399-489d-bcfb-3777731a905a","_uuid":"290cb4b0837bc5bacf036e3828b1b0433c5f7a76"},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":45},{"source":"We notice that the currency used for each country respondents is most of the time the local currency but not always so we can't directly use the PPP rates.    \nWhat we'll do instead is the following : \n1.

That being said, the problem is not entirely solved as the gap is still quite big comparing to the US. Why is that ? \n\nTwo main reasons : \n* Very populated and/or developing countries often set the value of their currency to be lower than the U.S. dollar because they want the cost of living to be lower, so that they can pay their workers less. This also mean that they are more attractive markers to big companies and investors who are interested in implementing themselves in countries where it would cost them less (Hello Apple) ! \n* There are some limitations to PPP rates. One of them is that, as we've said before, we use baskets of products and compare their price in different countries. By doing that, we are regaling with a similar group of commodities in both countries which is not entirely reasonable since production for some products depends on geographical parameters.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1a5162dd-6faa-4cac-b8b0-0e495efccc37","_uuid":"b04962ae3f5397782bd657ff552c484bae11480b"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Which country values its Data Scientists the most ?","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a5aed8d9-1859-44b0-b577-dcd67415e762","_uuid":"f1c08c665dab04fdbb8918c55b0d079cb6bb785e"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"We know the median salary for each country so we can compare between that and the median income in that country to measure how well is a data scientist paid by the standards of the country he lives in.\n\nUnfortunately, the information we find easily on the internet is the *average income* which is not trustworthy at all because as we know the mean is very sensitive to abnormally high values and, in any country in the world, the wealthiest people have ridiculous incomes.\n\nThat being said [Gallup](http://news.gallup.com/poll/166211/worldwide-median-household-income-000.aspx) conducted a survey between 2005 and 2012 to publish the medians over the world for 2013.

Some countries would pay more if you're good at visualizing data while others will pay more if you know how to use bayesian methods so the needs and the purpose of DS/ML vary across the world.**\n\n","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e134407d-2629-435b-bda7-1096a22ad0a7","_uuid":"a4ce9b42de5dc0479ee00044aef16e546825f77d"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Tools and programming languages used at work","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4a05f507-dc05-428a-bbd7-805a1d02c0f8","_uuid":"8fe62b457dda70c0a426faa4d6efe926e11c21c5"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"tools=['WorkToolsFrequencyC','WorkToolsFrequencyJava','WorkToolsFrequencyMATLAB',\n       'WorkToolsFrequencyPython','WorkToolsFrequencyR','WorkToolsFrequencyTensorFlow',\n       'WorkToolsFrequencyHadoop','WorkToolsFrequencySpark','WorkToolsFrequencySQL',\n       'WorkToolsFrequencyNoSQL','WorkToolsFrequencyExcel','WorkToolsFrequencyTableau',\n       'WorkToolsFrequencyJupyter','WorkToolsFrequencyAWS',\n       'WorkToolsFrequencySASBase','WorkToolsFrequencyUnix']\n\nd_tools_countries={} \nfor key, value in datasets.items():\n    d_tools_countries[key]={}\n    for col in tools : \n        tool = col.split('WorkToolsFrequency')[1]\n        d_tools_countries[key][tool]=value[value[col].isin(['Most of the time','Often'])]['AdjustedSalary'].median()\n        \npositions=[(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)]\nf,ax=plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2,figsize=(15,8))\nfor ((key, value), pos) in zip(d_tools_countries.items() , positions):\n    tools = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data=value, orient='index').round(2)\n    tools.sort_values(by=list(methods),axis=0, ascending=True, inplace=True)\n    tools.plot(kind='barh',figsize=(12,8),width=0.7,align='center',ax=ax[pos[0],pos[1]])\n    ax[pos[0],pos[1]].set_title(key,fontsize=14)\n    ax[pos[0],pos[1]].legend_.remove()\n    \n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show();\n        ","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8fadb534-098e-4473-a689-e66dc27bac06","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"147f51dea4bdb066eb4c3ae720c36216a82f8d41"},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":52},{"source":"I found the results on this plot quite surprising and not that expected.    \nTechnologies that are often used with big data architecture such as Hadoop, Spark and AWS grant good incomes abslutely everywhere, which is stunning.        \nJava users in the US seem to be well payed too, I didn't expect that actually but I thought about it and my guess is that data scientsts that still work with Java occupy senior positions and have been using it for a long time while Python and R coders can be junior data scientists.        \nMATLAB coders are the lowest paid in all countries.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2cdaa756-f7f5-4a14-a2e5-0cef608773ea","_uuid":"28d2d510557adfa79d37fd87f1e9e8c01c21333b"},"cell_type":"markdown"}],"nbformat_minor":1}
