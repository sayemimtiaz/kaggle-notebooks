A homogeneous possibility to derive output is framed by an inverted tree branched from the distributed root node to highly heterogeneous leaf nodes. Regression trees use classification trees for the dependent variable with continuous values and for the dependent variable with discrete values.\n\n## Basic Theory\nThe decision tree is derived from arguments where each node has a condition on a property. Nodes decide which node goes to the next node depending on the condition. Once the leaf node is reached, an output is predicted. The correct set of conditions makes the tree fruitful. entropy / information gain is used as criteria for selecting conditions in nodes. A recursive, greedy-based algorithm is used to derive the tree structure.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/690/1*xzF10JmR3K0rnZ8jtIHI_g.png)\nIn the above diagram, we can see a tree with internal nodes (conditions) and leaf nodes (reject / accept offer) with labels.\n\n\n## Algorithm for Choosing Conditions\nFor CART (classification and regression trees), we use the gini index as the classification criteria. It is a measure for calculating how well data points are mixed.\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/415/0*asbVp_8lwEsbfpOv.png)\nThe maximum gini indexed feature is chosen as the next condition at each stage of building the decision tree. The gini score will be maximum when the set is unevenly mixed.\n\n\n## Advantages\n- There is no need for preprocessing on the data.\n- There are no assumptions about the distribution of data.\n- Manages collinearity efficiently.\n- Decision trees can provide a clear explanation for the forecast.\n\n## Disadvantages\n- If we continue to build the tree to achieve high purity, we may have overfitted the model. Decision tree pruning can be used to solve this problem.\n- Prone to outliers.\n- The tree can get very complex when training complex data sets.\n- It loses valuable information while processing continuous variables.\n\n## Hyperparameters\nThe decision tree contains many hyperparameters and I will list a few of them.\n- criterion\n    - What cost function to select the next tree node. Mostly used are gini / entropy.\n- maximum depth\n    - The maximum allowed depth of the decision tree.\n- minimum sample division\n    - It is the minimum node required to split an internal node.\n- minimum sample sheet\n    - Minimum sample required in leaf node.\n    \n\n## Comparison with Other Models\n### Decision Trees vs Random Forest\n- Random Forest is a collection of decision trees and the average / majority vote of the forest is chosen as the predicted output.\n- The Random Forest model will be less inclined to adapt to the Decision tree and will provide a more general solution.\n- Random Forest is more robust and accurate than decision trees.\n\n### Decision Trees vs KNN\n- Both are nonparametric methods.\n- While the decision tree supports automatic feature interaction, it cannot be KNN.\n- The decision tree is faster due to the expensive real time implementation of KNN.\n\n### Decision Trees vs Naive Bayes\n- The decision tree is a distinctive model, while Naive bayes is a generative model.\n- Decision trees are more flexible and easy.\n- Decision tree pruning can neglect some core values in the training data, resulting in accuracy for one shot.\n\n### Decision Trees vs Neural Networks (NN)\n- Both find nonlinear solutions and have interactions between independent variables.\n- Decision trees are better when there is a large set of categorical values in education data.\n- When the scenario asks for an explanation about the decision, the decision trees are better than NN.\n- When there is sufficient training data, NN performs better than the decision tree.\n\n### Decision Trees vs SVM\n- While SVM uses kernel numbers to solve nonlinear problems, decision trees derive hyperrectangles in the input space to solve the problem.\n- Decision trees are better for categorical data and handle collinearity better than SVM.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Coding
