For this we need to teach the data to the model correctly. In order to prepare the available data for machine learning, we must apply certain pre-processing methods. One of these methods is the analysis of outliers. The outlier is any data point that is substantially different from the rest of the observations in a data set. In other words, it is the observation that goes far beyond the general trend.\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/854/1*RW-vfIbKZh-UGsLfTAWpyw.png\" />\n\nOutlier values behave differently from other data models and they increase the error with overfitting, so the outlier model must be detected and some operations must be performed on it.\n\n\nWe can see contradictory observations with many visualization techniques.

The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.\n\ny = b0 + b1*x\nb0 = constant\nb1 = coeff\nx = value\n\n### Advantages\n- Linear Regression is simple to implement and easier to interpret the output coefficients.\n- When you know the relationship between the independent and dependent variable have a linear relationship, this algorithm is the best to use because of it’s less complexity to compared to other algorithms.\n- Linear Regression is susceptible to over-fitting but it can be avoided using some dimensionality reduction techniques, regularization (L1 and L2) techniques and cross-validation.\n\n### Disadvantages\n- On the other hand in linear regression technique outliers can have huge effects on the regression and boundaries are linear in this technique.\n- Diversely, linear regression assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables. That means it assumes that there is a straight-line relationship between them. It assumes independence between attributes.\n- But then linear regression also looks at a relationship between the mean of the dependent variables and the independent variables. Just as the mean is not a complete description of a single variable, linear regression is not a complete description of relationships among variables.\n\n\n### Linear Regression Usage Areas\nLinear Regression is a rather ubiquitous curve fitting and machine learning technique that’s used everywhere from scientific research teams to stock markets. Some uses:\n- Studying engine performance from test data in automobiles\n- Least squares regression is used to model causal relationships between parameters in biological systems\n- OLS regression can be used in weather data analysis\n- Linear regression can be used in market research studies and customer survey results analysis\n- Linear regression is used in observational astronomy commonly enough. A number of statistical tools and methods are used in astronomical data analysis, and there are entire libraries in languages like Python meant to do data analysis in astrophysics.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f= plt.figure(figsize=(16,5))\n\nax=f.add_subplot(121)\nsns.distplot(df['charges'],bins=50,color='r',ax=ax)\nax.set_title('Distribution of insurance charges')\n\nax=f.add_subplot(122)\nsns.distplot(np.log10(df['charges']),bins=40,color='b',ax=ax)\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f = plt.figure(figsize=(14,6))\nax = f.add_subplot(121)\nsns.violinplot(x='sex', y='charges',data=df,palette='Wistia',ax=ax)\nax.set_title('Violin plot of Charges vs sex')\n\nax = f.add_subplot(122)\nsns.violinplot(x='smoker', y='charges',data=df,palette='magma',ax=ax)\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.jointplot(x=\"bmi\",y=\"charges\",data=df,kind=\"reg\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.jointplot(x=\"age\",y=\"charges\",data=df,kind=\"reg\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.jointplot(x=\"children\",y=\"charges\",data=df,kind=\"reg\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import the necessary packages\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom scipy.stats import boxcox\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\ndf_encode = df.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The Dummy variable trap is a scenario in which the independent variable are multicollinear, a scenario in which two or more variables are highly correlated in simple term one variable can be predicted from the others.\n\nBy using pandas get_dummies function we can do all above three step in line of code.
