The derived model will be more robust, accurate, and will handle overfitting better than constitutive models.\n\n## Basic Theory\nRandom Forest has a series of decision trees combined with the \"bagging method\" to obtain classification and regression outputs. In classification, the output is calculated using majority voting, while in regression the average is calculated.\n\nRandom Forest creates a robust and accurate model that can process a wide variety of input data with binary, categorical, continuous features.\n\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/592/1*i0o8mjFfCn-uD79-F1Cqkw.png)\n\n\n## Lost Function\nWe use the entropy / Gini score to calculate the missing value of data sets.\n\n\n## Advantages\n- The correct and powerful model.\n- It efficiently handles overfitting.\n- Supports implicit feature selection and derives feature significance.\n\n\n## Disadvantages\n- When the forest grows, it is computationally complex and slower.\n- It's not a well descriptive model on prediction.\n\n\n## Hyperparameters\n- **n_estimators:**\n    - Default: 100\n    - It is the number of trees in the forest. With a large number of trees comes high accuracy, but high computational complexity.\n- **max_features:**\n    - Default: 'auto'\n    - the maximum number of features allowed in a single tree.\n- **min_samples_split:**\n    - Default: 2\n    - The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n- **min_samples_leaf:**\n    - Default: 1\n    - The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.\n- **criterion:**\n    - Default: 'gini'\n    - The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are “gini” for the Gini impurity and “entropy” for the information gain. Note: this parameter is tree-specific.\n- **max_depth:**\n    - Default: None\n    - The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.\n    \n    \n## Comparison with Other Models\nThe Random Forest comparison is quite similar to Decision tree comparisons.\n\n### Random Forest vs Naive Bayes\n- Random Forest is a complex and large model, while Naive Bayes is a relatively small model.\n- While Naive Bayes perform better with small training data, RF needs a larger set of training data.\n\n### Random Forest vs Artificial Neural Networks (NN)\n- Both are very powerful and highly accurate algorithms.\n- Both have property interactions internally and are less explainable.\n- While Random Forest feature does not need scaling, NN does need to scale features.\n- The batch version of both models will be strong.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#
