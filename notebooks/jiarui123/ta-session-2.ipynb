Introduction\nThis may feel basic if you've done statistical modeling or machine learning before.\n\nWe'll start with a model called the Decision Tree. There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions. But decision trees are easy to understand, and they are the basic building block for some of the best models in data science.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll start with the simplest possible decision tree. \n\n![First Decision Trees](http://i.imgur.com/7tsb5b1.png)\n\nIt divides houses into only two categories. The predicted price for any house under consideration is the historical average price of houses in the same category.\n\nWe use data to decide how to break the houses into two groups,  and then again to determine the predicted price in each group.  This step of capturing patterns from data is called **fitting** or **training** the model. The data used to **fit** the model is called the **training data**.  \n\nAfter the model has been fit, you can apply it to new data to **predict** prices of additional homes.\n\n---\n# Improving the Decision Tree\nWhich of the following two decisions trees is more likely to result from fitting the real estate training data?\n\n![First Decision Trees](http://i.imgur.com/prAjgku.png)\n\n\nThe decision tree on the left (Decision Tree 1) probably makes more sense, because it captures the reality that houses with more bedrooms tend to sell at higher prices than houses with fewer bedrooms.  The biggest shortcoming of this model is that it doesn't capture most factors affecting home price, like number of bathrooms, lot size, location, etc. \n\nYou can capture more factors using a tree that has more \"splits.\" These are called \"deeper\" trees. A decision tree that also considers the total size of each house's lot might look like this: \n![Depth 2 Tree](http://i.imgur.com/R3ywQsR.png)\n\nYou predict the price of any house by tracing through the decision tree, always picking the path corresponding to that house's characteristics. The predicted price for the house is at the bottom of the tree.  The point at the bottom where we make a prediction is called a **leaf.**   \n\nThe splits and values at the leaves will be determined by the data, so it's time for you to check out the data you will be working with.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqFaTIg4myu9-T-fat2zjC5HmTpSybNfa"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

What is Model Validation\n\nYou'll want to evaluate almost every model you ever build. In most (though not all) applications, the relevant measure of model quality is predictive accuracy. In other words, will the model's predictions be close to what actually happens.\n\nMany people make a huge mistake when measuring predictive accuracy. They make predictions with their *training data* and compare those predictions to the target values in the *training data*. You'll see the problem with this approach and how to solve it in a moment, but let's think about how we'd do this first.\n\nYou'd first need to summarize the model quality into an understandable way. If you compare predicted and actual home values for 10,000 houses, you'll likely find mix of good and bad predictions. Looking through a list of 10,000 predicted and actual values would be pointless. We need to summarize this into a single metric.\n\nThere are many metrics for summarizing model quality, but we'll start with one called **Mean Absolute Error** (also called **MAE**). Let's break down this metric starting with the last word, error.\n\nThe prediction error for each house is: <br>\n```\nerror=actual−predicted\n```\n \nSo, if a house cost \\$150,000 and you predicted it would cost \\$100,000 the error is \\$50,000.\n\nWith the MAE metric, we take the absolute value of each error. This converts each error to a positive number. We then take the average of those absolute errors. This is our measure of model quality. In plain English, it can be said as\n\n> On average, our predictions are off by about X.\n\nTo calculate MAE, we first need a model.

We used a single \"sample\" of houses for both building the model and evaluating it. Here's why this is bad.\n\nImagine that, in the large real estate market, door color is unrelated to home price. \n\nHowever, in the sample of data you used to build the model, all homes with green doors were very expensive. The model's job is to find patterns that predict home prices, so it will see this pattern, and it will always predict high prices for homes with green doors.\n\nSince this pattern was derived from the training data, the model will appear accurate in the training data.\n\nBut if this pattern doesn't hold when the model sees new data, the model would be very inaccurate when used in practice.\n\nSince models' practical value come from making predictions on new data, we measure performance on data that wasn't used to build the model. The most straightforward way to do this is to exclude some data from the model-building process, and then use those to test the model's accuracy on data it hasn't seen before. This data is called **validation data**.\n\n\n# Coding It\n\n\nThe scikit-learn library has a function `train_test_split` to break up the data into two pieces.

As a point of reference, the average home value in the validation data is 1.1 million dollars.

"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 5. Underfitting and Overfitting\n\nNow that you have a reliable way to measure model accuracy, you can experiment with alternative models and see which gives the best predictions.  But what alternatives do you have for models?\n\nYou can see in scikit-learn's [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) that the decision tree model has many options (more than you'll want or need for a long time). The most important options determine the tree's depth.  Recall from the first section that a tree's depth is a measure of how many splits it makes before coming to a prediction.\n\nIn practice, it's not uncommon for a tree to have 10 splits between the top level (all houses) and a leaf.  As the tree gets deeper, the dataset gets sliced up into leaves with fewer houses.  If a tree only had 1 split, it divides the data into 2 groups. If each group is split again, we would get 4 groups of houses.  Splitting each of those again would create 8 groups.  If we keep doubling the number of groups by adding more splits at each level, we'll have \\\\(2^{10}\\\\) groups of houses by the time we get to the 10th level. That's 1024 leaves.  \n\nWhen we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf.  Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values, but they may make very unreliable predictions for new data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses).\n\nThis is a phenomenon called **overfitting**, where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data.  On the flip side, if we make our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups.  \n\nAt an extreme, if a tree divides houses into only 2 or 4, each group still has a wide variety of houses. Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason). When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called **underfitting**.  \n\nSince we care about accuracy on new data, which we estimate from our validation data, we want to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting.  Visually, we want the low point of the (red) validation curve in\n\n![underfitting_overfitting](http://i.imgur.com/2q85n9s.png)\n\n# Example\nThere are a few alternatives for controlling the tree depth, and many allow for some routes through the tree to have greater depth than other routes.  But the *max_leaf_nodes* argument provides a very sensible way to control overfitting vs underfitting.  The more leaves we allow the model to make, the more we move from the underfitting area in the above graph to the overfitting area.\n\nWe can use a utility function to help compare MAE scores from different values for *max_leaf_nodes*:\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\n\ndef get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y):\n    model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=max_leaf_nodes, random_state=0)\n    model.fit(train_X, train_y)\n    preds_val = model.predict(val_X)\n    mae = mean_absolute_error(val_y, preds_val)\n    return(mae)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data is loaded into **train_X**, **val_X**, **train_y** and **val_y** using the code you've already seen (and which you've already written)."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data Loading Code Runs At This Point\nimport pandas as pd\n    \n# Load data\nmelbourne_file_path = '../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv'\nmelbourne_data = pd.read_csv(melbourne_file_path) \n# Filter rows with missing values\nfiltered_melbourne_data = melbourne_data.dropna(axis=0)\n# Choose target and features\ny = filtered_melbourne_data.Price\nmelbourne_features = ['Rooms', 'Bathroom', 'Landsize', 'BuildingArea', \n                        'YearBuilt', 'Lattitude', 'Longtitude']\nX = filtered_melbourne_data[melbourne_features]\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# split data into training and validation data, for both features and target\ntrain_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y,random_state = 0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can use a for-loop to compare the accuracy of models built with different values for *max_leaf_nodes.*"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# compare MAE with differing values of max_leaf_nodes\nfor max_leaf_nodes in [5, 50, 500, 5000]:\n    my_mae = get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y)\n    print(\"Max leaf nodes: %d  \\t\\t Mean Absolute Error:  %d\" %(max_leaf_nodes, my_mae))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nOf the options listed, 500 is the optimal number of leaves.\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHere's the takeaway: Models can suffer from either:\n- **Overfitting:** capturing spurious patterns that won't recur in the future, leading to less accurate predictions, or \n- **Underfitting:** failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 6. Random Forest\nDecision trees leave you with a difficult decision. A deep tree with lots of leaves will overfit because each prediction is coming from historical data from only the few houses at its leaf.
