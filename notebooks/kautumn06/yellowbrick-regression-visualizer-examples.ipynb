It extends the scikit-learn API with a new core object: the `Visualizer`. Visualizers allow visual models to be fit and transformed as part of the scikit-learn pipeline process, providing visual diagnostics throughout the transformation of high-dimensional data.\n\nEstimator score visualizers *wrap* scikit-learn estimators and expose the Estimator API such that they have `fit()`, `predict()`, and `score()` methods that call the appropriate estimator methods under the hood. Score visualizers can wrap an estimator and be passed in as the final step in a `Pipeline` or `VisualPipeline`.\n\nIn machine learning, regression models attempt to predict a target in a continuous space. Yellowbrick has implemented the following regressor score visualizers that display the instances in model space to better understand how the model is making predictions:\n- `AlphaSelection` visual tuning of regularization hyperparameters\n- `PredictionError` plot the expected vs. the actual values in the model space\n- `Residuals Plot` plot the difference between the expected and actual values"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"96af911c9e4e517ad99c744cb9fa00db289ed0b0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Load the Data\n\nThe concrete dataset contains 1030 instances and 9 attributes.

Since regularization is designed to penalize model complexity, the higher the alpha, the less complex the model, decreasing the error due to variance (overfit). However, alphas that are too high increase the error due to bias (underfit). Therefore, it is important to choose an optimal alpha such that the error is minimized in both directions.\n\nTo do this, typically you would you use one of the \"RegressionCV” models in scikit-learn. E.g. instead of using the `Ridge` (L2) regularizer, use `RidgeCV` and pass a list of alphas, which will be selected based on the cross-validation score of each alpha. This visualizer wraps a “RegressionCV” model and visualizes the alpha/error curve. If the visualization shows a jagged or random plot, then potentially the model is not sensitive to that type of regularization and another is required (e.g. L1 or `Lasso` regularization)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f9e4d69c44c2c0460a468769633408b4aa89e291"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a list of alphas to cross-validate against \nalphas = np.logspace(-10, 1, 400)\n\n# Instantiate the linear model and visualizer \nmodel = LassoCV(alphas=alphas, cv=3)\nvisualizer = AlphaSelection(model)\n\nvisualizer.fit(X, y)              # Fit the data to the visualizer\ng = visualizer.poof()             # Draw/show/poof the data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"12069f1728dd82769b2158578245b61d078cdd5c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Yellowbrick also offers Classification, Clustering, Feature Analysis, Model Selection, and Text Modeling Visualizers.
