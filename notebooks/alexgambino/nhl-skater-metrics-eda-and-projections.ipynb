The following metrics will be considered:\n\n1. Time On Ice (TOI) per game\n2. Goals\n3. Assists\n4. Points\n5. Shots on Goal\n\nWe will only consider skaters who have a minimum of 15 games played in a season. Once we've analyzed and regressed skaters' previous performances, we will build a model inspired by [Tom Tango](https://twitter.com/tangotiger)'s MARCEL baseball forecasting model, and project these metrics for the 2020-2021 NHL season.\n\nNote: Only skaters who have met the requirement for minimum games played in the previous 3 seasons will be considered. Additionally, the projections will be made with the assumption that skaters will play the entire season without missing any games."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n1.

Considering how much Ovechkin shoots and scores, this comes as a bit of a surprise. It may be difficult to compare Gallagher to Ovechkin due to the difference in their shot quality, as Ovechkin is known to have one of the most powerful and accurate shots in the league, but as Wayne Gretzky once said, \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take\".\n\nGiven this metric, it might be worth considering giving Gallagher more playing time.

Season n-2 is about half of season n-1's value (28%), and season n-3 holds 15.3% of the total feature weight.\n\nIn the traditional MARCEL forecasting system, seasons n-1, n-2, and n-3 are given a weighting of 5,4, and 3, respectively. We can similarly convert the weights above to whole numbers in order to simplify our calculations. Tom Tango himself has said that there is not much loss in precision when rounding these weights to whole numbers.\n\n> **For goals, we'll use a weighting system of 6/3/1**\n\nAs an example, let's calculate Artemi Panarin's projected goals for the 2020-2021 season using the following steps:\n1. Calculate the weighted goals per game using our weighting system of 6/3/1\n2. Calculate the league-wide rate of goals per minute for forwards, and multiply it by Panarin's TOI per game (for each season)\n3. Find the rate of goals per 30.46 min of TOI (30.46 is used as it is double 15.23, which is the avg TOI for forwards over the last 3 seasons), and then find the rate of goals per minute. For defensemen, 39.3 will be used (39.3 is used as it is double 19.65, the avg TOI for defensemen over the last 3 seasons).\n4. Calculate Panarin's expected goals by multiplying the rate of goals per minute from step 3 by Panarin's projected TOI per game, and by the number of games in the season (56, in this case)\n5. Apply the aging factor to Panarin's projected goals. Using the peak age for time on ice found in Section 2, we will slightly increase a player's projected stats (by a factor of 0.006) if they are below the peak age, and slightly decrease them (by a factor of 0.003) if they are above the peak age. The factors of 0.006 and 0.003 are used in the traditional MARCEL baseball forecasting system, and we'll stick with those for these projections.\n\nNote: These steps will be reproduced to project Assists and Shots on Goal as well."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 1: Calculate weighted goals/GP\ndef get_weighted_stat(stat_n1, stat_n2, stat_n3, gp_n1, gp_n2, gp_n3, weight_n1, weight_n2, weight_n3):\n    return weight_n1*(stat_n1/gp_n1) + weight_n2*(stat_n2/gp_n2) + weight_n3*(stat_n3/gp_n3)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate league-wide goals per minute for each season\ndef get_league_stat_per_min(stat_total, toi_total):\n    return stat_total/toi_total\n\ndef get_weighted_stat_per_min(toi_n1, toi_n2, toi_n3, league_n1, league_n2, league_n3):\n    return (toi_n1*league_n1) + (toi_n2*league_n2) + (toi_n3*league_n3)\n\n# Step 3 and 4: Calculate projected stat\ndef get_projected_stat(weighted_stat, weighted_stat_per_min, weighted_toi_sum, avg_toi, proj_toi, gp):\n    toi_baseline = 2*avg_toi\n    stat_avg_rate = (weighted_stat_per_min / weighted_toi_sum) * (toi_baseline)\n    stat_per_min = (weighted_stat + stat_avg_rate) / (toi_baseline + weighted_toi_sum)\n    return stat_per_min*proj_toi*gp\n\ndef project_stat(stat, player_slice_df, skaters_df, projected_toi, mean_toi_position, gamesToPlay, weight_n1, weight_n2, weight_n3, birth_date, season_start, seasons):\n    weighted_stat = get_weighted_stat(player_slice_df.iloc[0][stat], player_slice_df.iloc[1][stat], \n                                               player_slice_df.iloc[2][stat], player_slice_df.iloc[0]['gamesPlayed'],\n                                               player_slice_df.iloc[1]['gamesPlayed'], player_slice_df.iloc[2]['gamesPlayed'],\n                                               weight_n1, weight_n2, weight_n3)\n\n    league_stat_per_min_n1 = get_league_stat_per_min(skaters_df.loc[skaters_df.season == seasons[0]][stat].sum(),\n                                                      skaters_df.loc[skaters_df.season == seasons[0]]['timeOnIce'].sum())\n\n    league_stat_per_min_n2 = get_league_stat_per_min(skaters_df.loc[skaters_df.season == seasons[1]][stat].sum(),\n                                                      skaters_df.loc[skaters_df.season == seasons[1]]['timeOnIce'].sum())\n\n    league_stat_per_min_n3 = get_league_stat_per_min(skaters_df.loc[skaters_df.season == seasons[2]][stat].sum(),\n                                                      skaters_df.loc[skaters_df.season == seasons[2]]['timeOnIce'].sum())\n\n    weighted_toi_n1 = weight_n1*(player_slice_df.iloc[0]['timeOnIcePerGame'])\n    weighted_toi_n2 = weight_n2*(player_slice_df.iloc[1]['timeOnIcePerGame'])\n    weighted_toi_n3 = weight_n3*(player_slice_df.iloc[2]['timeOnIcePerGame'])\n    weighted_toi_sum = weighted_toi_n1 + weighted_toi_n2 + weighted_toi_n3\n\n    weighted_stat_per_min = get_weighted_stat_per_min(weighted_toi_n1, weighted_toi_n2, weighted_toi_n3,\n                                                      league_stat_per_min_n1, league_stat_per_min_n2, league_stat_per_min_n3)\n\n    proj_stat =round(get_projected_stat(weighted_stat, weighted_stat_per_min, weighted_toi_sum, mean_toi_position, projected_toi, gamesToPlay))\n    \n    # apply aging\n    birth_date_dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(birth_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n    age = relativedelta(season_start, birth_date_dt).years\n    \n    proj_stat = apply_aging(proj_stat, age)\n    \n    return int(proj_stat)\n\ndef apply_aging(proj_stat, age):  \n    if(age <= 29):\n        return (1+(29 -

Hockey is a sport which, like all others, inevitably contains a certain amount of randomness. It's impossible to perfectly predict how many shots every player will take in a season, so being within 30 shots on average is a decent start for a simple model.\n\nOverall, the MARCEL model performs quite well when applied to hockey instead of baseball, and could provide a good starting point for one to build their own model. It is worth noting that this model would not work as well when projecting players who do not have 3 seasons-worth of data to draw from. However, with a few tweaks, a model based on the MARCEL forecasting system could provide accurate projections for the majority of skaters."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<a id =\"5\" > </a>\n# 5.
