Risk factors can be characteristics, conditions, or behaviours. \n\nWe build a **knowledge graph** by merging  entities and relations that we extract from the **CORD-19 corpus** with the **[Open Targets Genetics](https://genetics-docs.opentargets.org/)** dataset and the [Mondo Disease Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo). This is done to build a graph that merges COVID-19 facts extracted from bleeding-edge literature and known facts on similar diseases stored in datasets online. We achieve such goal despite the absence of COVID-19 from OpenTargets.\n\nLoosely inspired by [Mendelian Randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization), we train a **[graph representation learning model](https://github.com/Accenture/AmpliGraph)** that learns vector representations of the concepts in the graph (i.e. **graph embeddings**). Such operation leverages the topology and the semantics of the graph to discover new associations between risk factors and COVID-19. To sanity-check the trained embeddings, we carve out known risk factors-disease associations for better-studied conditions such as SARS, MERS, and we assess the predictive power of the model using agreed-upon evaluation protocol and metrics. Our model reaches a validation mean reciprocal rank MRR=0.07.\n\nFinally, we use the knowledge graph embeddings to infer how likely COVID-19 is impacted by a risk factor and we return a **ranked list of predicted risk factors** for COVID-19.\nOur results can be used either to test if a suspected risk factor applies to COVID-19, or to discover unsuspected risk factors.\n\n**The complete pipeline of the system is presented below**:\n\n![pipeline](https://kagglecovid.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/covid19_pipeline.jpg)\n\n\n### Benefits\n* First machine learning system that returns a ranked list of predited risk factors for COVID-19.\n* The knowledge graph can easily be extended and updated with additional information (e.g. paper citation network, additional genomic datasets, etc.).\n* Graph representation learning exploits relations between concepts shared across articles, and it is scalable to support larger graphs (up to 500+M edges).\n\n### Known Limitations\n* In this Phase 1 prototype, we limited to CORD-19 **biorxiv articles** only.\n* Our approach combining paper annotation with Open Targets assumes genetics and genomics play a role in the impact on COVID-19.\n* The NER step likely missed some entities in the text and mis-identified others. Our second step mapping these entities identified as keyword into entities identified with unique identifier introduces a second level of possible mapping errors;\n* The risk factor surfaced are correlations emerging from the structure of the graph, not causations. Our graph now an association network associating papers to the things they are about, and associating these things to each other;\n* Due to time constraints, we did not carry out exhaustive model selection (hyperparameter tuning), to the detriment of predictive power.\n* The embeddings have to be re-trained every time the network is changed (e.g. when new papers are added). This is a known limitation of knowledge graph embedding models.\n\n### Future Work Planned for Phase 2\n* Re-build the graph on all CORD-19 papers\n* Validation of the final output by domain experts.\n* For each COVID-19 - Risk Factor prediction, we will also provide an explanation, in the form of a meaningful and succint subgraph that mostly affected such prediction.\n* Extensive and thorough hyperparameter tuning to improve predictive power.\n* The machine learning model will be adapted to support the addition of new concepts (e.g. newly-published papers), without the need to re-train the model.\n* The work described in this notebook will be part of a [wider pipeline](https://www.kaggle.com/cgueret/covid-19-risk-factor-predictor-future-work) aimed at discovering additional COVID-19 insights from the CORD-19 corpus. \n"},{"metadata":{"id":"a4qmpIuzq_N1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### Results\n\n**Scroll down at the end of the notebook to see the list of COVID-19 risk factors predicted by our system.**\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"id":"u3SDMMJeq_N1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 1/3: NER\n\nThe first component of our system is the named-entity recognition & relation extraction.\nIt reads the CORD-19 corpus and extracts entities and relations that will be used later on to generate the knowledge graph.\n\n![](https://kagglecovid.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/covid19_pipeline_1.jpg)\n\n**The NER pipeline performs the following operations**:\n1.

The highest the score, the more likely such prediction is true.\n\nSuch predictions are carried out with knowledge graph embeddings, using the [AmpliGraph 1.3.1 library](https://github.com/Accenture/AmpliGraph). The knowledge grpah used is the result of step 2/3.\n\n**This is the last step of our contribution.**\n\n![covid19_pipeline_3.jpg](https://kagglecovid.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/covid19_pipeline_3.jpg)\n\n\n### Knowledge Graph Embedding Training\n\nWe train a knowledge graph embedding model using the ComplEx model [Trouillon et al. 2016] over the knowledge grpah generated at step 2/3. ComplEx reaches state-of-the-art predictive power on agreed upon [benchmark datasets](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/latest/experiments.html), and therefore is an obvious choice for this task.\n\nFor a comprehensive description of knowledge grpah embedding models, we suggest to read [this survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00388). The AmpliGraph library documention includes a [primer on the topic](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/1.3.1/background.html).\n\nWe train for 1,000 epochs, with an embedding size `k`=200, Adam optimizer (learning rate = 1e-4), [multiclass NLL loss](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/1.3.1/generated/ampligraph.latent_features.NLLMulticlass.html#ampligraph.latent_features.NLLMulticlass), L3 regularizer, and early stopping criteria.\n\nBelow we report a figure generated with [TensorFlow Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/). Each point in the cartesian space represents a bi-dimensional, t-SNE reduced representation of a 200-dimension embedding. Note that nodes and predicate types are embedded in the same space. The picture highlights the closest neighbours to COVID-19 in the uncompressed 200-dimensional space:\n\n\n![covid19_embedding_space.jpg](https://kagglecovid.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/covid19_embedding_space.jpg)\n\n\n### Sanity Check\nTo sanity-check the trained embeddings, we carve out known risk factors-disease associations for better-studied conditions (thus not including COVID-19), and we assess the predictive power of the model using agreed-upon [evaluation protocol](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/1.3.1/generated/ampligraph.evaluation.evaluate_performance.html#ampligraph.evaluation.evaluate_performance) and [metrics](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/1.3.1/generated/ampligraph.evaluation.mrr_score.html#ampligraph.evaluation.mrr_score). \n\nSuch validation set includes 100 randomly selected conditions (i.e. Diseases), each connected with a number of risk factors with the `hasGeneticClue` predicate. This led to a validation set that includes 2,452 triples.\n\nFor each of those triples, we generate 7,218 corruptions, obtained with the agreed upon [protocol]((https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/1.3.1/generated/ampligraph.evaluation.evaluate_performance.html#ampligraph.evaluation.evaluate_performance)) of replacing the object of a true triple with another concept. We use 7,218 concepts (unique diseases and risk factors) to generate 7,218 corruptions for each triple in the validation set. We then score a true triple and all its corrutpions, and we report how that true triple is ranked against its 7,218 corrutpions. We repeat the same procedure for each triple in the test set, and we compute the [mean reciprocal rank (MRR, filtered settings)]((https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/1.3.1/generated/ampligraph.evaluation.mrr_score.html#ampligraph.evaluation.mrr_score)).\n\nOur model reaches a validation mean reciprocal rank **MRR=0.07**.\n\nThe table below reports our validation results. We also include [Hits@10, Hits@100](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/1.3.1/generated/ampligraph.evaluation.hits_at_n_score.html#ampligraph.evaluation.hits_at_n_score) values, and we compare against a [baseline that returns random predictions](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/1.3.1/generated/ampligraph.latent_features.RandomBaseline.html#randombaseline) for positive and negative triples. \nThe table shows we largely outperform the random baseline across all the metrics.\n\n*Note MRR, Hits@10 and Hits@100 are values between [0,1], and the higher the better.*\n\n|                  | MRR   | Hits@10 | Hits@100 |\n|------------------|-------|:-------:|----------|\n| Random Baseline  | 0.001 | 0.001   | 0.012    |\n| Our Contribution | **0.07** | **0.137**   | **0.390**    |\n\n\nAs we pointed out at the top of the notebook, we had not carry out extensive hyperparametr selection yet. Such operation will likely increase the predictive power of the model, hence the quality of the embeddings used to infer risk factros for COVID-19. \n\n### Inference: COVID-19 Risk Factor Predictions\nOnce sanity-checked the model, we used the trained embeddings to predict the probability of existence of a number of hypothetical triples of the form `<COVID-19 hasGeneticClue ?>`, where `?` is a risk factor (that can be a characteristic, condition, or behaviour).\n\nThese scored hypothesis are sorted from the highest scored to the lowest. A high score indicates high likelihood that the predicted risk factor affects COVID-19.\n\nIn the cells below we describe the Knowledge Graph Embedding pipeline more in detail, and we provide the necessary source code to reproduce the experiment."},{"metadata":{"id":"bxs-PdKwq_O4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Install the dependencies"},{"metadata":{"id":"tNYwlMBVq_O5","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"! conda install tensorflow-gpu'>=1.14.0,<2.0.0' -y\n! pip install ampligraph","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"a7GBp_Coq_O7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import the necessary libs"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","id":"23rUiM6Vq_O7","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nos.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES']='0'\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(117)\nfrom ampligraph.latent_features import ComplEx, TransE, DistMult, RandomBaseline\n\nfrom ampligraph.evaluation import evaluate_performance, mrr_score, hits_at_n_score, mr_score\nfrom ampligraph.utils import save_model, restore_model\n\n\nDATASET_BASE_PATH = \"/kaggle/\"","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"n754j8h7q_O9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load the Knowledge graph"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","id":"itdEzJ5wq_O-","outputId":"157c4812-ca41-4984-aa29-e78220bc5b00","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"triples = pd.read_csv(\"graph.csv\")\n\npaper_diseases = set(triples[triples.predicate == 'isAboutDisease'].object)\npaper_targets = set(triples[triples.predicate == 'isAboutTarget'].object)\nnew_triples = []\nfor row in triples.itertuples():\n    if row.predicate == 'isAssociatedTo':\n        if row.subject in paper_targets or row.object in paper_diseases:\n            new_triples.append([row.subject, row.predicate, row.object])\n    if row.predicate == 'isAboutDisease' or row.predicate == 'isAboutTarget':\n        new_triples.append([row.subject, row.predicate, row.object])\n    if row.predicate == 'hasGeneticClue':\n        if row.subject in paper_diseases or row.object in paper_diseases:\n            new_triples.append([row.subject, row.predicate, row.object])\n    if row.predicate == 'isASpecific':\n        new_triples.append([row.subject, row.predicate, row.object])\n    if row.predicate == 'belongsToTherapeuticArea':\n        new_triples.append([row.subject, row.predicate, row.object])\nprint (len(new_triples))\n\n\ngraph_df = pd.DataFrame(new_triples, columns=['subject', 'predicate', 'object'])\n\n# this line is added for making sure that the results are reproducible.\ngraph_df.sort_values(by=['subject', 'predicate', 'object'], inplace=True)\n\ngraph_df.to_csv('COVID_KG_sample.csv', index=False)\n\ngraph_df.head()\n\nprint('Size of the graph:', graph_df.shape)\n\nprint(graph_df.columns)\n\nprint(graph_df.predicate.value_counts())","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"NOyr9kUIq_PA"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Construct the training set and validation set\n\nOur validation test consists of only the triples which have predicate `hasGeneticClue`.
