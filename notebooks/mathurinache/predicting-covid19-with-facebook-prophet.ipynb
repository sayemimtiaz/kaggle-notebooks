Naturally, any spread of disease is such a timeseries. Prophet fits an additive model to the timeseries based on seasonality, whether they are daily, weekly etc. It is available both for Python and R. The underlying language is Stan a Bayesian statistical modelling language that is extremely fast. <br>\n\nSo basically the model is based on a smoothed addition of the following 4 components:\n* The trend of the data\n* The weekly variations\n* The annual seasonality\n* And optionally holiday effects\n\nKeep in mind what it was designed for, to predict human behaviour. And the research by Facebook showed that most events were created on Mondays. <br>\nNow a virus is unlikely to be affected by holidays, or weekdays although people were worried about the Chinese new year celebrations that could have worsened the outbreak. However, it is unlikely that the limited data that is currently available (about two months) is sufficient to pick up any such trend. The same is true for annual seasonality as we need a minimum of one year to be able to pick this up. <br> \n\nOk so let us do Prophet do its magic and see what we can learn. \n\n**Note that the dataset does not update unless you use the Kaggle version.

This is obviously not possible as that would require an infinite \"supply\" of infectable humans. However, at the moment that is the case as the virus makes its way across the globe. In reality, what we would expect is an exponential growth curve that will eventually plateau and drop again. You can see an example of the US flu season (2018-19) recorded by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6824a3.htm).\n\n![](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/figures/mm6824a3-F1.gif)\n\nAs we are only two months into the Coronavirus data this trend is not yet apparent but will eventually set in. This means any model we create has to be updated very frequently as we will eventually get astronomical predictions.\n\n### Interpreting the weekly plot\nWhat is apparent is that the error margin is very large suggesting that there is no variation over the week. This would be expected as the spread of a virus is not affected by weekdays. <br>\nBut what about Wednesday? It appears there is a drop of cases on Wednesdays. That does not really make sense as mentioned before a virus does not care what day of the week it is. <br>\nWhat we see here is a change in case definition on Wednesday 19th of February. On that day China changed its reporting standards, which was later reversed. This caused a drop of about two-thirds in new cases on this particular Wednesday, explaining the weekly model.\n\n### Interpreting the monthly model\nAgain this has to be taken with a pinch of salt because we only have two months worth of data. However, the model suggests that more new cases occur around the middle of the month. This could potentially be an actual behaviour of the outbreak. <br>\nWhat epidemiologists call an index case or patient zero is the first human that became infected. This most likely was a once-off event. The source of the virus is not known but the go-to culprits based on investigations into SARS are always bats on a meat market. That is an educated guess and might well prove wrong. Whether or not the source is bats the virus must have jumped species, from an animal to humans. This is a rarerish event and this caused the infection of patient-zero. Patient-zero will then have continued their normal daily routine for approximately two weeks before they showed symptoms. That means that an increase in roughly two-week waves is imaginable. <br>\n\nContributing to this will be the guideline changes described in the interpretation of the weekly plot, as these occurred in the middle of the month.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So far so good that are the components of our quick model.

The direction of overall case numbers is probably true. If you look closely in March you can see a shoulder in the data. This looks suspiciously similar to the shoulder seen in February. I have explained in detail how it came to this ledge in this [post](https://medium.com/@treich112/tracking-the-coronavirus-without-the-panic-53b580dee5c1). In summary, the definition of what constitutes a coronavirus case changed a couple of times making it first less than more sensitive. So this ominous shoulder is not \"real\" as the cases will have continued to grow unhindered by legislation change. <br>\n\nOur model, however, does not know these details and it appears to have learned that the coronavirus spreads with these characteristic shoulders. This highlights the issue with real-life data, that can be affected by simple guideline changes.
