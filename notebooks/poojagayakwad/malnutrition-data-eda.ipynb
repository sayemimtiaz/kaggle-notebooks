It usually indicates recent and severe weight loss, because a person has not had enough food to eat and/or they have had an infectious disease.\n\n### severe wasting :\nThis is characterized by a massive loss of body fat and muscle tissue. Children who are severely wasted look almost elderly and their bodies are extremely thin and skeletal.\n\n### stunting : \nStunting is when a child has a low height for their age, usually due to malnutrition, repeated infections, and/or poor social stimulation.If stunting is a low height for a child's weight, wasting is low weight for a child's height. \n\n### Underweight : \nChildren with low weight-for-age are known as underweight. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted, or both.\n\n### Overweight: \nOverweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=est.copy()\nest.isnull().any()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Replacing NaN values of some columns with zero\ndf['Severe Wasting']= df['Severe Wasting'].fillna(0.0)\ndf['Wasting'] = df['Wasting'].fillna(0.0)\ndf['Overweight'] = df['Overweight'].fillna(0.0)\ndf['Stunting'] = df['Stunting'].fillna(0.0)\ndf['Underweight'] = df['Underweight'].fillna(0.0)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#  -> Malnutrition in India\n###  We have data from years 1989, 1992, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2006, 2014, 2015, 2017","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# list of undernutrition parameters\nparam_list =[ 'Overweight','Severe Wasting','Stunting', 'Underweight', 'Wasting']\n\n\ndf2 =df.loc[df.Country == 'INDIA']\n\nind_data =pd.DataFrame(columns =['parameter','Year','value'])\n\nyears =[1989, 1992, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2006, 2014, 2015, 2017]\n\n# storing data year wise\nfor param in param_list:\n    for year in years:\n        value=df2.loc[df2.Year == year][param]\n        value_dict = {'parameter':param,'Year':year,'value':value}\n        ind_data = pd.concat([ind_data, pd.DataFrame(data=[value_dict])])\n    \n        \nplt.figure(figsize =(10,8))\nsns.barplot(data =ind_data, x='Year', y='value', hue='parameter')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Observations from this plotting:\nA significant %  of children still have 'Stunting','Underweight' and 'Wasting' undernutrition problems in  our country.\n\nThere is a huge decrease in 'Stunting %' (from 65% to 35%) and 'Underweight %'(from 55% to 38%) over the years.\n'Overweight %' is very less in the country around 2-3%.
