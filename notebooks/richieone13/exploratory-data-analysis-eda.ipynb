I hope this is interesting for you as it is for me as I am from the UK.\n\nFeel free to fork for your own learning and edit the code or use in your own submissions.

id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n\n# Conclusion\nThere are a lot of interesting column variables to explore and find relationships to success.\n\nWe have explored fields to determine the high level metrics to enable success of a team, i.e. the scatterplot of how to qualify for the NCAA team, which can be drilled down even further and how it changed over the years.\n\nIt's worth exploring how the NCAA tournament works and the rules and how the teams match up against each other to understand more the underlying reason if we want to call finishing well at a NCAA tournament a factor for success or is it have the best win/game ratio?\n\nFrom being a basketball enthusiast, there a waaay more factors that determine the success for a team, you can see the champion teams, they have lost some games! It can be determine, by the players (note they play college for 1-3 years generally), it can be due to the coaching facility, the head coach, even how adaptable they are towards the game. \n\nThe game of basketball has changed and have a lot more focus and emphasis with shooting the 3-point shot, which is actually driven by data analytics. This is why I find data analytics and data science so interesting because of it's many sources of applications.\n\nThank you all for reading - Richie\n\nI can be connected on LinkedIn.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/richieone/\n\n### What's Next\nI intend to work on finding out these questions along the dataset.\n\n* Finding the underdog teams, and how they progressed throughout the years.\n* How college basketball how progressed throughout the years. i.e. number of 3 point shots taken, how the average offensive and defensive rating has changed."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
