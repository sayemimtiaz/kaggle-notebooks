We recommend that you work on the exercises while reading the corresponding tutorials.  \n\n**To start the first exercise, please click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/587970).**\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to create your own data, along with how to work with data that already exists.  \n\n# Getting started\n\nTo use pandas, you'll typically start with the following line of code.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Creating data\n\nThere are two core objects in pandas: the **DataFrame** and the **Series**.\n\n### DataFrame\n\nA DataFrame is a table.

But, most of the time, we won't actually be creating our own data by hand. Instead, we'll be working with data that already exists.\n\nData can be stored in any of a number of different forms and formats. By far the most basic of these is the humble CSV file. When you open a CSV file you get something that looks like this:\n\n```\nProduct A,Product B,Product C,\n30,21,9,\n35,34,1,\n41,11,11\n```\n\nSo a CSV file is a table of values separated by commas. Hence the name: \"Comma-Separated Values\", or CSV.\n\nLet's now set aside our toy datasets and see what a real dataset looks like when we read it into a DataFrame. We'll use the `pd.read_csv()` function to read the data into a DataFrame.
