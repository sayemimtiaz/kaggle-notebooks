Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n   \n\n<img src=\"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/images/campaign2018/GHD-UVLight-1080x1080.gif\" width=\"600px\" height=\"600px\">\n   \n   \n   Maintain at least 2 metre (6 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.\n   \n  \n<img src=\"https://d1nakyqvxb9v71.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Social-no-dots-3-27.gif\" width=\"650px\" height=\"650px\">\n\n    \n   Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 2 metre (6 feet).\n   \n   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.\n   \n   <img src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/d2/a8/5dd2a87cd2a8199e1b13630bdbd17ef1.gif\" width=\"550px\" height=\"550px\">\n   \n   \n   Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.\n   \n   Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.\n   \n   <img src=\"https://www.verywellhealth.com/thmb/FXwOsscJpzls46TQPuazu6pkTqA=/400x250/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/what-scientists-know-about-covid-19-4800685_final-94a4fe120b4f416a98ee8b134416c939.gif\" width=\"550px\" height=\"550px\">\n   \n   If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What is COVID-19 ?\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\n\n## How does it spread ?\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.\nYou can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.\n\n## What are the symptoms of COVID-19? \n\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer , are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill. Even people with very mild symptoms of COVID-19 can transmit the virus. People of all ages who experience fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.\n\n## What is the curve?\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wMJBgLczxnQQBsEC9QBmuW-970-80.gif\" width=\"750px\" height=\"750px\">\n\n\nThe \"curve\" researchers are talking about refers to the projected number of people who will contract COVID-19 over a period of time. (To be clear, this is not a hard prediction of how many people will definitely be infected, but a theoretical number that's used to model the virus' spread.)\n\nThe curve takes on different shapes, depending on the virus's infection rate. It could be a steep curve, in which the virus spreads exponentially (that is, case counts keep doubling at a consistent rate), and the total number of cases skyrockets to its peak within a few weeks. Infection curves with a steep rise also have a steep fall; after the virus infects pretty much everyone who can be infected, case numbers begin to drop exponentially, too. \n\n## How do we flatten the curve?\n\n   <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif\" width=\"750px\" height=\"750px\">\n   \nAs there is currently no vaccine or specific medication to treat COVID-19, and because testing is so limited in the U.S., the only way to flatten the curve is through collective action. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that all Americans wash their hands frequently, self-isolate when they're sick or suspect they might be, and start \"social distancing\" (essentially, avoiding other people whenever possible) right away. \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Helpful Resources:\nThe Coronavirus Explained & What You Should Do: https://youtu.be/BtN-goy9VOY \n\nCoronavirus Curves and Different Outcomes:      https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/coronavirus/\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Objective of the Notebook:\n\nObjective of this notebook is to study COVID-19 outbreak with the help of some basic visualizations techniques.
