There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each other. This dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places.\n\nThe Times Higher Education World University Ranking is widely regarded as one of the most influential and widely observed university measures. Founded in the United Kingdom in 2010, it has been criticized for its commercialization and for undermining non-English-instructing institutions.\n\nThe Academic Ranking of World Universities, also known as the Shanghai Ranking, is an equally influential ranking. It was founded in China in 2003 and has been criticized for focusing on raw research power and for undermining humanities and quality of instruction.\n\nThe Center for World University Rankings, is a less well know listing that comes from Saudi Arabia, it was founded in 2012.\n\nHow do these rankings compare to each other?\nAre the various criticisms levied against these rankings fair or not?\nHow does your alma mater fare against the world?\n\n**Supplementary Data**\nTo further extend your analyses, we've also included two sets of supplementary data.\n\nThe first of these is a set of data on educational attainment around the world. It comes from The World Data Bank and comprises information from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and the Barro-Lee Dataset. How does national educational attainment relate to the quality of each nation's universities?\n\nThe second supplementary dataset contains information about public and private direct expenditure on education across nations.

Histogram\n\nA histogram is a graph where the data are stocked and the each stocked is counted and represented. More broadly, in plotly a histogram is an accumulated bar chart, with several possible accumulation functions. The data to be stocked can be numerical data but also categorical or date data. It is commonly used in dealing with large data of sets.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Students-staff ratio in 2011 and 2012 \nx2011 = timesData.student_staff_ratio[timesData.year == 2011]\nx2012 = timesData.student_staff_ratio[timesData.year == 2012]\n\ntrace1 = go.Histogram(\n    x=x2011,\n    opacity=0.75,\n    name = \"2011\",\n    marker=dict(color='rgba(171, 50, 96, 0.6)'))\n\ntrace2 = go.Histogram(\n    x=x2012,\n    opacity=0.75,\n    name = \"2012\",\n    marker=dict(color='rgba(12, 50, 196, 0.6)'))\n\ndata = [trace1, trace2]\nlayout = go.Layout(barmode='overlay',\n                   title=' students-staff ratio in 2011 and 2012',\n                   xaxis=dict(title='students-staff ratio'),\n                   yaxis=dict( title='Count'),\n)\n\nfig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)\nplotly.offline.iplot(fig) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"8\" ></a>\n# 8.
