A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n\nThe dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n\nRun the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project.

For each data point (neighborhood):\n- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.\n- `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\" (working poor).\n- `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.\n\n\n** Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an **increase** in the value of `'MEDV'` or a **decrease** in the value of `'MEDV'`? Justify your answer for each.**\n\n**Hint:** This problem can phrased using examples like below.  \n* Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value(number of rooms) of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?\n* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value(percent of lower class workers) of 15 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value of 20?\n* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'PTRATIO'` value(ratio of students to teachers) of 10 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'PTRATIO'` value of 15?"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"2aa5e98163f393861e8e0c2901a2aca2623ff295"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Answer: ** In my opinion, the value of 'MEDV' will be dependent on these 3 features in the following way:\n\n1) **RM** - The more the value of RM, the more will be the value of 'MEDV'. Because it's pretty evident that with increase in the number of rooms, the price of the house will increase.\n\n2) **LSTAT** - The more the value of LSTAT, the less will be the value of 'MEDV'. Because with increase in the percentage of \"lower class\" homeowners in the neighbourhood, the crime rate in the neighbourhood may increase. Even though LSTAT doesn't have a causal effect on the crime rate in the neighbourhood, they are likely to be positively correlated. One more factor is if there are greater percentages of \"lower class\" homeowners in the neighbourhood, then more likely very expensive real estate owners will not build their housing complexes in that region as most of the people will not be able to afford it. So in average, the houses in that region will be cheaper.\n\n3) **PTRATIO** - The lesser the value of PTRATIO, the more will be the value of 'MEDV'. Because if the students to teacher ratio is low, then that means individual students gets much more attention from the students as opposed to a region where this ratio is high. Over there, as the number of students will be much higher than the number of teachers, teachers will not be able to attend to students individually everytime and hence this may affect the education of the students. So regions with a low PTRATIO will have higher prices for houses."},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"c189a186d89871eda1087ce6c49b079daab3681c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Initial Visualization"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"54dba09fe89619bd0f948c93a621627e46ec5443","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Using pyplot\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 5))\n\n# i: index\nfor i, col in enumerate(features.columns):\n    # 3 plots here hence 1, 3\n    plt.subplot(1, 3, i+1)\n    x = data[col]\n    y = prices\n    plt.plot(x, y, 'o')\n    # Create regression line\n    plt.plot(np.unique(x), np.poly1d(np.polyfit(x, y, 1))(np.unique(x)))\n    plt.title(col)\n    plt.xlabel(col)\n    plt.ylabel('prices')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"13df265ec830bfe1179613c298b54f588e64d953"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"----\n\n## Developing a Model\nIn this second section of the project, we will develop the tools and techniques necessary for a model to make a prediction.

But that creates a problem. Here there is a very high chance of getting a high variance model which may eventually lead to a 100% accuracy rate with addition of new features, but that's only because it is overfitting the data. It has developed such a complex model that it will have limited or no ability to generalize data and so when we use that model on unknown data, it will give us very very low accuracy. So to avoid that, we can split the data into training and testing sets and train the model on the training data. Then the testing accuracy is a much better estimate than the training accuracy. \n\nBut then, the split might create a problem too. If we have a very limited dataset, then even if we take out a small sample of it as testing data, then also , we are losing a portion of the data. So there's an inherent trade off here which might cause underfitting due to limited datasets. This is where we can take advantage of K-fold cross validation where we divide all the datapoints into k number of bins and then run k separate learning experiments. In each of those, we pick one of those k subsets as our testing set and the remaining k-1 bins as our training sets.

But if your training and testing curves are converging with a score above your benchmark threshold, would this be necessary?\nThink about the pros and cons of adding more training points based on if the training and testing curves are converging."},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"2bcdd955693b9270603f6a2deb3ccd82b608aa0a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Answer:\n\nA) max_depth = 1 (High Bias Scenario):  We see that initially the Testing Score(green line)  increases with increase in number of training points. But then it plateaus at a very low accuracy score of 0.4 or 40% and increase in number of training points have no effect. This shows that the model does not generalize well on unseen data. On the other hand, the Training Score(red line)  decreases with increase in the number of training points and gets saturated at a score of approximately 0.4 or 40%. This shows that the model is actually underfitting the data and is not complex enough. In this scenario, adding more training points will not benefit the model. Instead, its complexity should be increased for better fitting the dataset.\n\nB)max_depth = 3 (Best scenario): Testing Score(green line) increases with increase in training points. It reaches a pretty high score of 0.8 and so we can see the model generalizes well. The Training Score(red line) decreases slightly and reaches 0.8 and stays constant. So we see it fits the model well and reaches a pretty high score. The testing score has two significant phases where the rates of change are different. One is the positive rate of change which goes on uptil approximately 200 training points (within this positive rate of change, we again observe two different rates. One is uptil 50 training points where the rate of increase is very high.The other is between 50 - 200 where the rate of increase is much lower.) and the other is the region where it plateaus with no/very little rate of change which is beyond 200 training points. So if we are below 200 training points, adding more training points will definitely improve the score but beyond that adding more training points will not be very useful as the rate plateaus.\n\nC) max_depth = 6 (High Variance Scenario): Testing Score(green line) increases with increase in training points and reaches 0.7. Even though this is not a bad accuracy, it is not generalizing the data as well as max_depth = 3. The Training Score(red line) decrease ever so slightly and stays at 0.9 which is a big sign that it is overfitting the data. It is a High Variance problem. Here also, the testing score show a similar behaviour as the previous one (it plateaus after 200 training points). So once again, we will get an improvement in the testing score by adding more training points when the nuber of training points is less than 200, but after that adding more training points will not benefit us much.\n\nD) max_depth = 10 (Higher Variance Scenario): Testing Score(green line) increases with increase in training points and reaches 0.7. So same problem as the previous one. It is not generalizing the data as well as scenario B). The  Training Score(red line) remains constant throughout showing a perfect accuracy of 100% or a score of 1 which tells us it is definitely overfitting the data. This is also a very High Variance problem. Once again the curve show exactly the same behaviour where adding more training points upto 200 will increase the score but not beyond that.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"af253272e47160270847f617a581ccb6c1b55dd8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Complexity Curves\nThe following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths.

This is because in High Bias scenarios, the model underfits the data and also cannot generalize the data well resulting in both curves converging to a low score.\n\nIf there is High Variance, there will be a large gap between the Training and Testing Scores. This is because in High Variance model, even though the model fits well, it does not generalize well as a result of overfitting. This leads to a high Training Score but a relatively low Testing/Validation Score.\n\nA) Maximum Depth = 1 (High Bias): Here both Training and Testing Scores are low. So the model is not fitting well and so it is not generalizing well. Thus the two curves are very close to each other and hence this is a High Bias situation.\n\nB) Maximum Depth = 10 (High Variance): Here there is a huge gap between Training and Testing Scores. The Training score is almost perfect at 1, but the testing score is much low at around 0.7. So the model is overfitting and hence does not generalize well resulting in a lower Validation Score.

Then we train our machine learning algorithm and just like before test the performance on the testing set. The key thing in cross validation is we run this multiple times (k times) and then we average the k different testing set performances for the k different hold out sets. So we average the test results from those k experiments. So obviously this takes more computation time as now we have to run k separate learning experiments, but the assessment of the learning algorithm will be more accurate.\n\nIf we run Grid Search without running a cross validation set, we will have different sets of optimal hyperparameters because without a cross validation set, the estimate of out-of-sample performance would have a high variance. \n\nSo in summary, without k-fold cross validation, the Grid Search will select hyper parameter values which works really well on the sample train test split data but there is a high risk that it will work poorly for unknown datasets because of high variance.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"caa9510684ac27b4e6a4b8a562f72c47ec3e588b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Implementation: Fitting a Model\nOur final implementation requires that we bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that we are producing an optimized model, we will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n\nIn addition, we will find our implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While we're working on our implementation, we'll think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n\nPlease note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\nFor the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, we will need to implement the following:\n- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable."},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"de5e7d278411c525d71bbfd198f0c310d3dd8f46","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# TODO: Import 'make_scorer', 'DecisionTreeRegressor', and 'GridSearchCV'\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import make_scorer\nfrom sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV\n\ndef fit_model(X, y):\n    \"\"\" Performs grid search over the 'max_depth' parameter for a \n        decision tree regressor trained on the input data [X, y]. \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create cross-validation sets from the training data\n    # sklearn version 0.18: ShuffleSplit(n_splits=10, test_size=0.1, train_size=None, random_state=None)\n    # sklearn versiin 0.17: ShuffleSplit(n, n_iter=10, test_size=0.1, train_size=None, random_state=None)\n    cv_sets = ShuffleSplit(X.shape[0], n_iter = 10, test_size = 0.20, random_state = 0)\n\n    # TODO: Create a decision tree regressor object\n    \n    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state = 1001)\n\n    # TODO: Create a dictionary for the parameter 'max_depth' with a range from 1 to 10\n    tree_range = range(1, 11)\n    params = dict(max_depth=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])\n\n    # TODO: Transform 'performance_metric' into a scoring function using 'make_scorer' \n    scoring_fnc = make_scorer(performance_metric)\n\n    # TODO: Create the grid search cv object --> GridSearchCV()\n    # Make sure to include the right parameters in the object:\n    # (estimator, param_grid, scoring, cv) which have values 'regressor', 'params', 'scoring_fnc', and 'cv_sets' respectively.\n    grid = GridSearchCV(regressor,params,scoring=scoring_fnc,cv=cv_sets)\n\n    # Fit the grid search object to the data to compute the optimal model\n    grid = grid.fit(X, y)\n\n    # Return the optimal model after fitting the data\n    return grid.best_estimator_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"36ee52bb6d430084c3f0a2a4e0545fff99916316"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Making Predictions\nOnce a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used to make predictions on new sets of input data.

This is also reasonable because of very low Poverty Level and Student to Teacher ratio and also a high number of rooms.\n\nSo overall, the prices for all the clients seem reasonable."},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"00218dfe3da410c11f049582b22e812cef1682a1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Perfomance Metric\n\nLet us calculate the R squared value for our model."},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"0113d69f2528fd07047faea91626a2af55f8f865","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"reg = fit_model(X_train, y_train)\npred = reg.predict(X_test)\nscore = performance_metric(y_test,pred)\nprint(\"R Squared Value: \" + str(score))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"f7141377aa6c6225854a7dadad777b5f60ee450e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So we get a pretty good R squared score from our model."},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"ac04d7e5a52fbeb60af4a17966d9561d8de82040"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Visualization"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"b1f1fb15fab90119dbd804d0d7fc295ca5d92c3c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.hist(prices, bins = 20)\nfor price in reg.predict(client_data):\n    plt.axvline(price, lw = 5, c = 'r')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"543f5237d479c96fc446c20091f8c020a4f89215"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Sensitivity\nAn optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given.

Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?\n- Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?\n- Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?\n- Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood?"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"c9e6e63584a79ec5e019f3f31599a7d52086b718"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Answer: ** \n\n1) The data which was collected in 1978 is not so relevant today because demographics and economy has changed a lot since then.\n\n2) The features present in the data is not sufficient to describe a home.

We can add more features like crime rate, transportation avalibility, presence of pool or not, square feet of the plot area, quality of appliances, flooring in the home and more.\n\n3) This model based on its current feature is robust enough to make consistent predictions with a small margin of error.\n\n4) Data collected in an urban city like Boston may not be applicable in a rural city as many properties will change like the Demographics, Economy, Average income etc. So we would have to take in account a lot of other features in order to build an effective model\n\n5) Neighbourhood plays a very vital role in judging the price of a house like the crime rate, schools, transportation etc. But if an individual house has some marked characteristics which can overshadow the factors that neighbourhood plays, then it would not be fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
