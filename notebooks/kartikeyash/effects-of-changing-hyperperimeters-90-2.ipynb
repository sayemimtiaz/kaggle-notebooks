They go for having more data and say nothing better can be done with what they have.\n\nIn this notebook I've tried to explain that what does the change in hyperperimeters of a model have on the accuracy of the model. First I've explained **from where and why the parameters are introduced** after that tried to show the **effect of those parameters** on the model.\n\nThis notebook has a lot more math, so I recommend going slowerly.

"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Naive Bayes\n* Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.\n\n* As we have only two possible values of $y$, we will use Bernoulli Naive Bayes for our case.\n* The decision rule for Bernoulli naive Bayes is based on:\n$\n\\: P(x_i \\mid y) = P(i \\mid y) x_i + (1 - P(i \\mid y)) (1 - x_i)\n$\n. It explicitly penalizes the non-occurrence of a feature  that is an indicator for class $y$.\n\n* Naive Bayes is also Naive in terms of hyperperameters, we can only experiment with smoothing. Let's first see from where this parameter alpha comes.\n\n## Basic Notations:\n* Naive Bayes is a generative learning algorithm. i.e. instead of modeling $p(y|x)$ directly (such as logistic regression), here we try to model $p(x|y)$ (and $p(y)$).\n* For instance, if $y$ indicates whether an example is a dog(0) or an elephant(1), then $p(x|y=0)$ models the distribution of dogs' features, and p(x|y=1) models the distributions of elephants' features.\n* After modeling $p(y)$ (called class priors) and $p(x|y)$, our algorithm can use Bayes rule to derive $p(y|x)$\n$$\n    \\: p(y|x) = \\frac{p(x|y)p(y)}{p(x)}\n$$\n* Here $p(x) = p(x|y=1)p(y=1) + p(x|y=0)p(y=0)$. Thus this can be expressed in terms of the quantities we have learned.\n* In order to make predictions we don't actually need the $p(x)$ term.\n$$\nargmax_y(p(y|x)) = argmax_y \\frac{p(x|y)p(y)}{p(x)}\n$$\n$$\n= argmax_y p(x|y)p(y)\n$$\n\n* Let, \n\n$\ny \\sim Bernoulli(\\phi)\n$\n\n$\np(x_i = 1| y=1) = \\phi_{i|y=1}\n$\n\n$\np(x_i = 1 | y=0) = \\phi_{i|y=0}\n$\n\n$\np(y=1) = \\phi_y\n$\n\n* So parameters we want to learn are $\\phi_{i|y=1}$, $\\phi_{i|y=0}$, $\\phi_y$\n\n* We can write down the joint likelihood of the data as:\n $$\n \\mathcal{L}(\\phi_y, \\phi_{i|y=0}, \\phi_{i|y=1}) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^m{p(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})}\n $$\n* Maximizing the above equation w.r.t  $\\phi_y, \\phi_{i|y=0}, \\phi_{i|y=1}$ we get our trained parameters.\n* To predict new example\n$$\np(y=1|x) = \\frac{p(x|y=1)p(y=1)}{p(x)}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n{p(x_i|y=1)})\\ p(y=1)}{(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n{p(x_i|y=1)})\\ p(y=1)\\ +\\ (\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n{p(x_i|y=0)})\\ p(y=0)}\n$$\n\n## Laplace smoothing\n* Lets take a look at the best explanation I've seen so far: This has been taken from [CS229 Lecture Notes](https://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/cs229-notes2.pdf).\n* Consider spam/email classification, and lets suppose that, after completing CS229 and having done excellent work on the project, you decide around June 2003 to submit the work you did to the NIPS conference for publication.\n(NIPS is one of the top machine learning conferences, and the deadline for submitting a paper is typically in late June or early July.) Because you end up discussing the conference in your emails, you also start getting messages\nwith the word “nips” in it. But this is your first NIPS paper, and until this time, you had not previously seen any emails containing the word “nips”; in particular “nips” did not ever appear in your training set of spam/non-\nspam emails. Assuming that “nips” was the 35000th word in the dictionary, your Naive Bayes spam filter therefore had picked its maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters $\\phi_{35000|y}$ to be\n$$\n\\phi_{35000|y=1} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} 1\\{x_{35000}^{(i)} = 1 \\wedge y^{(i)}=1\\}}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}\\{ y^{(i)}=1\\}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{35000|y=0} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} 1\\{x_{35000}^{(i)} = 1 \\wedge y^{(i)}=0\\}}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}\\{ y^{(i)}=0\\}} = 0\n$$\n\n* I.e. because we have never seen \"npis\" before in either spam or not spam training examples, it thinks the probability of seeing it in either type of email is zero. Hence, when trying to decide if one of these messages containing “nips” is spam, it calculates the class posterior probabilities, and obtain\n$$\np(y=1|x) = \\frac{(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n{p(x_i|y=1)})\\ p(y=1)}{(\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n{p(x_i|y=1)})\\ p(y=1)\\ +\\ (\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n{p(x_i|y=0)})\\ p(y=0)} = \\frac{0}{0}\n$$\n* Hence our algorithm doesnot know how to make a prediction in this case.\n\n* Stating the problem more broadly, it is statistically a bad idea to estimate the probability of some event to be zero just because you haven’t seen it before in your finite training set.\n\n* Take the problem of estimating the mean of a multinomial random variable z taking values in $\\{1, . . . , k\\}$. We can parameterize our multinomial with $\\phi_i = p(z = i)$. Given a set of m independent observations $\\{z (1) , . . . , z (m) \\}$, the maximum likelihood estimates are given by\n\n$$\n\\phi_j = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} 1\\{z^{(i)} = j \\}}{m}\n$$\n\n* As we saw previously, if we were to use these maximum likelihood estimates, then some of the $\\phi_j$’s might end up as zero, which was a problem. To avoid this, we can use Laplace smoothing, which replaces the above estimate with\n$$\n\\phi_j = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} 1\\{z^{(i)} = j \\} + \\alpha}{m+k}\n$$\n\n* Now we have:\n$$\n\\phi_{j|y=1} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} 1\\{x_{j}^{(i)} = 1 \\wedge y^{(i)}=1\\} + \\alpha}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}\\{ y^{(i)}=1\\} + 2}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{j|y=0} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} 1\\{x_{j}^{(i)} = 1 \\wedge y^{(i)}=0\\} + \\alpha}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}\\{ y^{(i)}=0\\} + 2}\n$$\n\n* The parameter $\\alpha$ in the above equation is the one we are going to vary and see how our results vary."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"alpha_values = [0, 0.8, 1.0, 5.0, 100.0, 200.0, 230.0, 300.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 10000.0]\n\naccuracies = []\nfor alpha in alpha_values:\n    clf = BernoulliNB(alpha=alpha)\n\n    # Train\n    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n    # Calculate the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels.\n    accuracies.append(clf.score(X_test, y_test))\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nfig.set_size_inches(14, 4)\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Value of $\\\\alpha$\", fontsize=16)\nax.set_ylabel(\"Accuracy\", fontsize=16)\nax.set_title(\"Naive Bayes\", fontsize=20)\n\nfor i, accuracy in enumerate(accuracies):\n    ax.text(i, accuracy, np.round(accuracies[i], 2), color='black', ha=\"center\", fontsize=14)\n\nsns.barplot(x=alpha_values, y=accuracies, ax=ax)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* If we choose high values of smoothing we will loose a lot of accuracy.

The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to $w_i = 1/N$, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence.\n* There is not much math to explain on where hyperparameters come from in this case. Learning rate is analogous to learning rate in gradient boosting classifier.\n* **base_estimator**: The classifier to be used as weak learner.\n* **n_estimators**: Number of estimators to be used for prediction.\n* **algorithm**: (SAMME, SAMME.R) If ‘SAMME.R’ then use the SAMME.R real boosting algorithm. base_estimator must support calculation of class probabilities.
