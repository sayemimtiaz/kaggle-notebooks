{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is the final portion of an effor to optimize some parameters for a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. We break up this effort into multiple steps in order to speed up testing and making changes. This also uses less memory and is less likely to time out.  There are many parameters we could attempt to optimize.  However, due to processing constraints we limit ourselves to the number of topics and the number of features (word or bigrams).\n\nA topic model learns a topic-feature matrix of abstract topics and features (word or ngrams) and a document-topic matrix of documents and topics, from a document-feature matrix of documents and features. From this factorization we achieve statistical feature vectors for each topic and topic vectors for each document in the training corpus. We can then find topic vectors for the questions we would like to ask the corpus of documents. We will use the closest matching documents in the CORD-19 dataset in an attempt to answer the task questions. LDA assumes a Dirichlet prior on topic-feature and document-topic distributions. In other words it assumes each topic is defined by and small collection of words or ngrams and that each documnent consists of a small number of topics.\n\nThe advantage of trying to find some configurations of LDA training parameters with better coherence scores is that the resulting topic model might perform better under this tasks queries than they would from random parameter selection.  However, coherence is not a human measure (involving humans would be expensive and negate the benifit of first step automation) and we only varied a select few parameters (there are more parameter that could impact human perception of the results).\n\nWe will be relying on paper titles and PIDs as answers to the task's queries.  The papers have the advantage of being written by humans (rather than a generated summary) and therefore is assumed to be understandable.  However, it is up to the person asking the question to then go to the referenced papers and determine if their question is answered."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\n#for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n#    for filename in filenames:\n#        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Additional Imports \nGensim imported for natural language processing tasks; matplotlib imported for plotting; pickle used for opening results saved from previous steps;"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import gensim\nimport matplotlib\nimport pickle\nimport gc","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Definitions from preprocessing kernel\n\nIncluding definitions from the preprocessing step here.

However, we were unable to use this technique because each mumber of the population requires compute and memory resources to evaluate the objective function. \n\nDifferential evolution uses a population to try many different parameters, removes the poor performing population members, makes combinations of the more successfull population members, performs some mutations, and then repeats until some stopping condintion (number of evolutions, or no improvement after a given number of steps).  In this way it hopes to achieve good non-linear optimization.  Differential evolution is similar to genetic algorithms, but skips the chromosome string encoding and acts directly on the variables.   We would need to reserve extra compute resources for this technique.
