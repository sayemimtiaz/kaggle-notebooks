The bank would like to identify these customers early in order to maliciously trap them in a usurous cycle. The goal of this brief investagation will be to try to develope a model which identifes customers who are about to leave their credit card services. While this data can be used by banks in order to retain customers. This data can be utilized by a regulating body such as the SEC in order to integrate into a larger model in order to identify preditory lending techniques and identify at risk consumers. \n\nThis investagation will explore serveral different models and compare the resultant accuracy of these model via a cross validation metric along with a brief discussion.

Additionally, due to some of the warnings yielded, it seems the support vector machines may not have even converged on every itteration. This validated my initial hypothesis as I didn't scale/normalize any of my features. A nonconvergance is an additional demonstration for why you want to normalize utilizing these algorithms. Additionally, the vanilla arguements (learning parameters, ext ...) should be adjusted for less marginal results \n\n\nThe next worst performing algoithm was the GaussianNB which is a Naive Bayes variant, which is not a huge surprise. Naive Bayes relies on an assumption that features are independant of one another, which may not be the case with our dataset. For example there is a possible correlation between Education_Level and Income_Category. The next best performing algorithm is the decission tree classifier. Descission trees benefit from the fact that they are relatively simple models and require relatively little data preparation. Finally, our top perfoming algorithms are the two ensemble algorithms - the random forest classifier and the XGBClassifier. The XGBClassifier was able to predict whether or not a customer was going to churn with an accuracy of 93%.
