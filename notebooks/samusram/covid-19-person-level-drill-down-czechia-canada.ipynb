for both Czech females and males, age groups between 20–29, 40–49, and 50–59 have a significantly higher risk of being exposed to COVID-19 than at random.\n   * What's the likely reason? -> these are active groups which have to go to work even during the official state of emergency\n   * Women and men between 30–39 doesn't have a higher risk. Why? -> It was a puzzling observation at first. Then, I checked that the average age of Czech mothers is 30.1 years at birth (source in Czech). It means that among 30–39-year-old people there are many parents of young children.

Everyone can play a part!\n\n* efficient state policies for protecting older population groups seem to have an effect, thankfully. However, the policies seem to be more efficient for females. So, for men in their 60's and 70's exposure to COVID-19 is not significantly less than at random, while for women of the same age the exposure is significantly less. It might be worth investigating this fact further and see whether or not it might be due to better discipline among women/staying at home with grandchildren more often/other reason.\n* thankfully, the proportion of imported cases is going down justifying the governmental traveling restrictions.\n* it seems that we can be reasonably calm about the youngest of our close ones. I still believe that even people under 19 shouldn't let their guard down, as it is known that people who don't have symptoms can still infect others.\n* the risk groups differ in Canada, there they are more shifted towards older people. The difference might be given by different policies of the Czech and Canadian governments. It might suggest the importance of the governmental policies (like the Czech policy allowing only older population groups to visit groceries, post offices, etc. during the morning hours).\n\n## Limitations discussion\n* As it was noted previously, the data about positive COVID-19 cases are likely to be biased towards people who not only contracted COVID-19, but at the same time had moderate, severe, or critical symptoms. In accordance with the agreement in the Data section, throughout the post by \"contracting COVID-19/be exposed to COVID-19/ect.\" we meant \"contracting COVID-19 and having moderate, severe, or critical symptoms\".\n* Next, the COVID-19 sample in the data is likely to be biased towards people who wanted to be tested themselves. E.g. there might be COVID-19-positive people with moderate symptoms who preferred not to visit health facilities during the epidemic and were undocumented, while there might be COVID-19-positive people with mild symptoms who preferred to visit a testing center.\n* Moreover, in the beginning of epidemic testing capacities could have been insufficient and it likely introduced additional biases, e.g. during early weeks there was a bias towards cases with critical symptoms. \n* Next, we've analyzed data about confirmed COVID-19 positive cases. We didn't have info about the person-level mortality, or consequences of the virus, which would be very important to analyze.\n* Furthermore, we didn't have information about preexisting health conditions of patients, which also are crucially important to analyze.\nOverall, I'd view this exploratory data analysis as relatively preliminary and would suggest to repeat and extend it once better person-level data are available.\n\n\nTake care and stay healthy, everyone!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
