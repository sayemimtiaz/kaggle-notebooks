My main questions are:\n\n- What are his most popular tweets ?\n- How popular its tweets became over the years ?\n- Is is possible to predict a tweet's number of retweets ?\n- What is the distribution of the number of retweets ?\n- What are the most common words used in his tweets ?\n\nFirst, you have to know, I decided that a popular tweet was a tweet with a lot of retweets.
