Retailers typically offer steep discounts on Black Friday to kick off the holiday season.Black friday is the one of the most profitable days for all the retailers and for the buyers too. It’s common for retailers to offer special promotions and open their doors during the pre-dawn hours on Black Friday to attract customers.\n\nTo keep up with the competition, retailers need some insights and cluster of customers to segmantize and to target them. So, retailers can use different marketing strategies to attract different types of customers.\n\nData scientist can help retailers with proper insights based on the historical data of black friday and also give proper data driven solutions by using Data science methods and by following the **CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining)**. Thus, they can achieve thier target/goal.This project is all about this.\n\nIn this Notebook, we are going to follow stages,\n\n1. Business Understanding\n2. Data Understanding\n3. Prepare Data\n4. Data Modeling\n5. Evaluate the Results\n6. Deploy\n\n## 1. Business Understanding\nAs mentioned above, All the retailers' goal is to attract more and more customers for black friday deals. This is like a competition for them to get the customers to thiers online platforms or physical retail stores. So let's start exploring the dataset.\n\nFirst We will import libraries and load the data"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, \n\n# data visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# data preprocessing\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn.impute import KNNImputer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\n\n# Machine Learning Algorithms\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor \nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor\n\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom xgboost.sklearn import XGBRegressor\n\n# utils\nimport os\nimport warnings\nimport pickle\nfrom math import sqrt\n\n\n# To ignore warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# standard scaler object\nstdscaler = StandardScaler()\n\n# check the data files\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# create Training Dataframe\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/black-friday/train.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
