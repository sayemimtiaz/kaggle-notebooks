{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\n**This article** is inspired by [Great Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-height-and-weight-analysis/data)\n\n**Mostly**, nba Players are very bigger than others. Basketball's goal is about 3 meters high, so height is very important for basketball players. However, nba team dosen't need only high player but also small player (nba standard). They are often called as \"Guard\" or \"Back-Court\". Main role and representative players of each position is as bellow.\n\n* Guard: Handling ball, shooting and passing - Magic, Steph, ... \n* Forward: Scoring or attacking to the rim - MJ, KD, ...\n* Big-man: Rebounding - Shaq, DJ ...\n\n**Traditionally**, nba players are as above. But recently, it looks changing. The huge thing is that big-man is getting shooter or play-maker by gradual. Nba teams require players who can do various roles well. Traditional big-man cannot shoot or create other players' shoot chance. Awkward players aren't needed for league like that. This movement is \"Small Ball\". As showing that, nba supporters often say that nba players are getting smaller because of small line-up like Golden State Warriors or Houston Rockets. But, There are high-impact big players for example Lebron, AD, Yokic and so on. This article shows that how Nba Players Build changes and trend of Nba Style."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Preprocessing\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nba-players-data/all_seasons.csv\")\n\n#revise draft data\ndf['drafted'] = np.where(df['draft_year'] != 'Undrafted', 1, 0)\ndf['draft_year'] = df['draft_year'].replace(r'Undrafted', np.nan, regex=True)\n\n#convert datatime\ndf['draft_year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['draft_year'])\ndf['season'] = pd.to_datetime(df['season'].str[:4])\n\nprint(\"complete\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.Defference between Drafted and Undrafted Player"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(13,10), dpi=80)\nsns.boxplot(x=\"age\", y='usg_pct', data=df, hue='drafted')\n\nplt.title('USG% Defference between Drafted or Undrafted', fontsize=22)\nplt.legend(title='Drafted')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Graph illustrates drafted players have larger effect on team offense."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
