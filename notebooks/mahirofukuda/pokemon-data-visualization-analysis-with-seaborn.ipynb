Which is the best Generation?**\n\nPokemon is the japanese icon today. Now there are more than 800 characters and 18 type in Pokemon. Pokemon's status depends on its tribe. For example,　Mewtwo, legendary pokemon has the best status in 1st Generation. Then which generations dose have the best status? \n\n**2. Correlation of Pokemon's Stats**\n\nAre there any correlation among Pokemon's stats? Check and draw heatmap for finding correlation of Pokemon's stats.\n\n**3. The Relation of Type and Stats**\n\nPokemons' tyepe is various. We guess that Pokemon whose type is \"fighting\" is good at \"attack\" or psychic Pokemon is nice for \"special attack\". Dose Pokemon's type affect against their stats? \n\n\n**Pokemons status' summary**\n* **HP**: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting.\n* **Attack**: the base modifier for normal attacks.\n* **Defense**: the base damage resistance against normal attacks.\n* **SP Atk**: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks.\n* **SP Def**: the base damage resistance against special attacks.\n* **Speed**: determines which pokemon attacks first each round.\n******"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Spider Plot Visualization on their Stats\n**In the beginning**, status of *Bulbasaur*, *Ivysaur*, *Venusaur* that ia one of the most common Pokemon are as follow."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom math import pi\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pokemon/Pokemon.csv\")\ndf_status = df[[\"Name\",\"HP\",\"Attack\",\"Defense\",\"Sp.
