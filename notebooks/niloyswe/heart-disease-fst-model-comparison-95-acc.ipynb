common metric is the Area Under the Curve, or AUC. This is a convenient way to capture the performance of a model in a single number, although it's not without certain issues. As a rule of thumb, an AUC can be classed as follows,\n\n - 0.90 - 1.00 = excellent\n - 0.80 - 0.90 = good\n - 0.70 - 0.80 = fair\n - 0.60 - 0.70 = poor\n - 0.50 - 0.60 = fail","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ROC_Curve = {}\n\n# Instantiate the classifiers and make a list\nclassifiers = [LogisticRegression(),\n               DecisionTreeClassifier(),\n               RandomForestClassifier(),\n               SVC(probability=True),\n               GaussianNB(),\n               KNeighborsClassifier()]\n\n# Define a result table as a DataFrame\nresult_table = pd.DataFrame(columns=['classifiers', 'fpr', 'tpr', 'auc'])\n\n# Train the models and record the results\nfor cls in classifiers:\n    model = cls.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    yproba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[::, 1]\n\n    fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, yproba)\n    auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, yproba)\n    \n    print(\"AUC of\", cls ,\" is : \", auc * 100)\n    ROC_Curve[cls] = auc * 100\n    \n    result_table = result_table.append({'classifiers': cls.__class__.__name__,\n                                        'fpr': fpr,\n                                        'tpr': tpr,\n                                        'auc': auc}, ignore_index=True)\n    \n\n# Set name of the classifiers as index labels\nresult_table.set_index('classifiers', inplace=True)\n\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\n\nfor i in result_table.index:\n    plt.plot(result_table.loc[i]['fpr'],\n             result_table.loc[i]['tpr'],\n             label=\"{}, AUC={:.3f}\".format(i, result_table.loc[i]['auc']))\n\nplt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='orange', linestyle='--')\n\nplt.xticks(np.arange(0.0, 1.1, step=0.1))\nplt.xlabel(\"False Positive Rate\", fontsize=11, fontname = 'Times New Roman')\n\nplt.yticks(np.arange(0.0, 1.1, step=0.1))\nplt.ylabel(\"True Positive Rate\", fontsize=11, fontname = 'Times New Roman')\n\n# plt.title('ROC Curve Analysis', fontweight='bold', fontsize=11, fontname = 'Times New Roman')\nplt.legend(prop={'size': 13}, loc='lower right')\n\nplt.savefig('ROC Curve Sf1.pdf')  \nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-07T16:55:34.750395Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-07T16:55:34.750973Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-07T16:55:35.536453Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-07T16:55:34.750939Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-07T16:55:35.535451Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"colors = [\"purple\", \"green\", \"orange\", \"magenta\",\"#CFC60E\",\"#0FBBAE\"]\n\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nplt.figure(figsize=(16,8))\nplt.yticks(np.arange(0,100,10))\nplt.ylabel(\"Accuracy % \", fontsize = 16)\nplt.xlabel(\"Algorithms\", fontsize = 16)\nplt.title(\"ROC Curve of Different Classifier\")\nsns.barplot(x=list(ROC_Curve.keys()), y=list(ROC_Curve.values()), palette=colors)\n\nplt.show()","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-07T16:55:35.538084Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-07T16:55:35.538356Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-07T16:55:35.937661Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-07T16:55:35.538329Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-07T16:55:35.933451Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Log loss\n\nLog loss, also called “logistic loss,” “logarithmic loss,” or “cross entropy” can be used as a measure for evaluating predicted probabilities.\n\nEach predicted probability is compared to the actual class output value (0 or 1) and a score is calculated that penalizes the probability based on the distance from the expected value.
