Although I've been a user of this platform for 2 years now, searching for data, reading notebooks, browsing through users and competitions, I've never participated myself. But this platform has helped me tremendously during my studies and has been a fascinating digital refuge for me, in search of amazing things us humans have learned to do. It is why I also wish to start contributing more to this industry and its community. I will try to make my submisions as thorough as possible, so that others may learn from me, as I have also done. Also, without wanting to seem umprofesional, I would like to keep an easy-going, reader-friendly language and let you be the judges of that. \n\n\n## Objectives, tasks and questions\n\nAs per this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate\">Wikipedia Article</a>, churn \"is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. The general purpose or end-goal of this notebook is to predict if a bank's customer will churn, by making use of Supervised Machine Learning methods. I chose this dataset because I believe it to be an everyday industrial use of these technologies and techniques.Obviously, the dataset is very basic and real corporations from the financial sector probably have a much more thorough and extensive 'case file' on their clientele. But this data will do just fine. Below, I am going to enuntiate a  \n\n\n### Step 1: Data Mining\n- Check database for duplicates and missing values.\n- Check data types.\n- Check dispersion of data\n- Check Pearson's Correlation Matrix \n- Detect outliers \n\n### Step 2: Data analysis \n- What is the range of values for credit scores? \n- Where do our customers come from? \n- What is the gender distribution?\n- Our newest and oldest customers?\n- Active / inactive distribution. \n- Salary in relation to the balance. \n- Plot the results! \n- Come up up interesting numbers?\n- What are the actionable insights?\n\n### Step 3: Machine Learning:\n- Do we have enough data? Is there some way to use data augmentation?\n- Is this a Regression or a Classification problem?\n- Candidates for y: Exited (binary classification) & Credit Score (regression) & Gender (binary classification)\n- Candidates for algorithms: XGBoost & ANN.\n\n\n# I.

It takes a bit of time to run but the end result is worth it. We can even color code the plot's hue by a feature of our choice. In this case, blue is remaining customers and orange is exited customers.\n\n### Insights \n\nExited customers are older, on average, than those still active. This kind of makes sense, as clients who have left must have been with the bank some time. The young ones have not really had the reason or the opportunity to yet leave. The bank should look out for middle aged clients who might be looking for alternatives. \n\nThe exited customers also had higher balances on average. Again, this makes more sense if we look back at the previous ovservation. Having younger clients naturally means that their savings are likely to be lower, and so should their income. Either way, what we can observe is basically two large groups (or sub-distributions) in each distribution (exited/not-exited): those with low balance (actually most of it is absolute zero) and the other ones, which have a Gaussian Bell Shaped distribution of data points, as all data tends to conform to eventually. \n\nThe customers that remain mostly have 0 to 1 products. Those who have exited also held up to 4, in a small proportion. I believe there might be something unexplained in the data here. Perhaps it is because the bank used to have more products but now it doesn't, and older customers, with greater tenure, that have been with them for a long time, benefited from different products/services that are no longer available. Or perhaps the tendency is for clients to not use those products anymore.  \n\nIndeed,there were more exited customers who didn't have a card. This is a sure sign of not sticking with the bank much.

This would make including both features of such pairs redundant, since they influence the result in similar fashion.

This explains the negative correlation.)\n- High correlation between Exited and Age. (The older the client, the higher the probability of having left.)\n- Some small positive correlation between Exited and Balance. \n- Some negative correlation between Exited and Active/Inactive.\n\nOverall, we have heteroscedasticity.

The data is small and clean. The predicted outcome is binary. The data points are labeled and the learning is supervised. Still, there is much to be learned from the Exploratory Data Analysis and from basic Statistical Assumptions about the underlying structure of the data. When I say this, I am referring to the relationships that exists between the studied variables and even about their own individial characteristics such as distribution. \n\nThis type of work could come in handy to an organization that cares about customer retention. I would recommend that machine learning could be used to flag customers that are potentially willing to leave the bank. After this, a case worker cand pick up the person's profile and analyse it. A decision on how to proceed with the client is made by balancing the worker's expertize, experience and guts and insights that were gained through Data Analytics.\n\nWe saw here a brief taste of what it means to search for good hyperparameters, we saw what regularization techniques can do for the model's performance. We saw that re-sampling imbalanced datasets can be used to reduce bias. Basic data visualization on-the-go is great for testing assumptions and getting creative. \n\nI truly hope that you find this notebook useful and that it also finds you in your time of need. ^^ Please leave a comment if you liked it and don't be afraid to question, criticize or direct to my attention any peculiarity that you find here.
