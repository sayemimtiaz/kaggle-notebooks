This notebook focuses on citations related to articles tagged as COVID-19. The goal with this notebook is to give a good starting point in learning more about COVID-19. The more times researchers are citing a paper, the more likely it's to be good quality work that is worth reviewing. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install paperai project\n!pip install git+https://github.com/neuml/paperai","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from paperai.highlights import Highlights\nfrom paperai.tokenizer import Tokenizer\n\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport pycountry\n\nSTOP_WORDS = set(stopwords.words(\"english\")) \n\n# Tokenizes text and removes stopwords\ndef tokenize(text, case_sensitive=False):\n    # Get list of accepted tokens\n    tokens = [token for token in Tokenizer.tokenize(text) if token not in Highlights.STOP_WORDS]\n    \n    if case_sensitive:\n        # Filter original tokens to preserve token casing\n        return [token for token in text.split() if token.lower() in tokens]\n\n    return tokens\n\n# Country data\ncountries = [c.name for c in pycountry.countries]\ncountries = countries + [\"USA\"]\n\n# Lookup country name for alpha code.
