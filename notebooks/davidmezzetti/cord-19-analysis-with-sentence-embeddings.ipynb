Background on this method can be found in this [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-sentence-embedding-index-with-fasttext-and-bm25-f07e7148d240) and an existing repository using this method [codequestion](https://github.com/neuml/codequestion).\n\nThe embeddings index takes each COVID-19 tagged, not labeled a question/fragment, having a detected study type, tokenizes the text, and builds a sentence embedding. A sentence embedding is a BM25 weighted combination of the FastText vectors for each token in the sentence. The embeddings index takes the full corpus of these embeddings and builds a [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) index to enable similarity searching. \n\nImportant source files to highlight\n\n* Indexing Process -> [index.py](https://github.com/neuml/paperai/blob/master/src/python/paperai/index.py)\n* Tokenizer -> [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/src/python/txtai/tokenizer.py)\n* Embeddings Model -> [embeddings.py](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/src/python/txtai/embeddings.py)\n* BM25 Scoring -> [scoring.py](https://github.com/neuml/txtai/blob/master/src/python/txtai/scoring.py)\n\nFastText vectors trained on the full CORD-19 corpus are required. A [dataset with pre-trained vectors](https://www.kaggle.com/davidmezzetti/cord19-fasttext-vectors) is included and used in this notebook. Building the vectors takes a couple of hours when locally trained and would most likely take much longer within a notebook. \n\nVectors can optionally be (re)built by running the following command with the project and articles.sqlite database installed locally:\n\n```\npython -m paperai.vectors\n```\n\nThe following code builds the embeddings index using fastText vectors trained on the full CORD-19 dataset. Alternatively, any [pymagnitude vector file](https://github.com/plasticityai/magnitude#pre-converted-magnitude-formats-of-popular-embeddings-models) can be used the build the sentence embeddings.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import shutil\n\nfrom paperai.index import Index\n\n# Copy vectors locally for predictable performance\nshutil.copy(\"../input/cord19-fasttext-vectors/cord19-300d.magnitude\", \"/tmp\")\n\n# Build the embeddings index, limit to most recent documents\nIndex.run(\"cord19q\", \"/tmp/cord19-300d.magnitude\", 100000)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\n\n# Workaround for mdv terminal width issue\nos.environ[\"COLUMNS\"] = \"80\"\n\nfrom paperai.highlights import Highlights\nfrom txtai.tokenizer import Tokenizer\n\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport pycountry\n\n# Use paperai + NLTK stop words\nSTOPWORDS = Highlights.STOP_WORDS | set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))\n\n# Tokenizes text and removes stopwords\ndef tokenize(text, case_sensitive=False):\n    # Get list of accepted tokens\n    tokens = [token for token in Tokenizer.tokenize(text) if token not in STOPWORDS]\n    \n    if case_sensitive:\n        # Filter original tokens to preserve token casing\n        return [token for token in text.split() if token.lower() in tokens]\n\n    return tokens\n    \n# Country data\ncountries = [c.name for c in pycountry.countries]\ncountries = countries + [\"USA\"]\n\n# Lookup country name for alpha code.
