The answers are wholly generated by the system from the publicatons cited below the answer.  There is also a link with the question pre-loaded to the CORD19 web-based corpus (QA) search.\n\n**PROBLEM:** When a new virus is discovered and causes a pandemic, it is important for scientists to get information coming from all scientific sources that may help them combat the pandemic.  The challenege, however, is that the number of scientific papers created is large and the papers are published very rapidly, making it nearly impossible for scientists to digest and understand important data in this mass of data.\n\n**SOLUTION:** Unsupervised scientific literature understanding system that accepts natural language quesitons and returns specific answers from the CORD19 scientific paper corpus.\n\n**APPROACH:**\n- meta.csv and full text versions (if available) of the COVID-19 relevant documents were exported to a MySQL database \n- the natural language questions for the task are contained in a list \n- the natural language questions are stemmed and stop words removed for passing to the database query\n- the query is run on the MySQL datatbase using NLP mode in MySQL through a custom API\n- The full text results are parsed into sentences and then scored and ordered for relevance\n- raw_score = total count of the keywords in the sentence\n- final_score = (raw_score/len(sentence))*raw_score - if all terms are in a sentence it recieves +1\n- a csv file is returned to the notebook as a pandas dataframe\n- if the question calls for a specific answer, the quesiton_answer module is sent the first 5 sentences and the original question - shout out to Dave Mezzetti for suggesting this QA impelmentation from huggingface.\n- https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow2-question-answering/discussion/123434\n- if the question calls for a summary, the first 50 sentences are sent to the prepare summary answer.\n- https://pypi.org/project/bert-extractive-summarizer/\n- The question,answers and table of relevant scientific papers are returned in HTML format.\n\n**Pros:** The system provides very responsive and seemingly accurate answers to specific questions. \n\n**Cons:** The system currently does not indicate anything regarding the study type, study design or author ratings about the articles relied on in the answers.  This is a work in progress - still working on the summarizer to provide better answers."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"###################### LOAD PACKAGES ##########################\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk import PorterStemmer\nfrom IPython.core.display import display, HTML\nimport torch\n#!pip install -q transformers --upgrade\nfrom transformers import *\n!pip install bert-extractive-summarizer\nfrom summarizer import Summarizer\n#from transformers import pipeline\nimport pandas as pd\n\n#https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rN0CS0hoxeByoPZu6_zF-AFJijYLsPw3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def remove_stopwords(query,stopwords):\n    qstr=''\n    qstr=qstr.join(query)\n    #remove punctuaiton\n    qstr = \"\".join(c for c in qstr if c not in ('!','.',',','?','(',')','-'))\n    text_tokens = word_tokenize(qstr)\n    #remove stopwords\n    tokens_without_sw = [word for word in text_tokens if not word in stopwords.words()]\n    #stem words\n    tokens_without_sw=stem_words(tokens_without_sw)\n    str1=''\n    str1=' '.join(word for word in tokens_without_sw)\n    return str1\n\ndef stem_words(words):\n    stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n    singles=[]\n    for w in words:\n        singles.append(stemmer.stem(w))\n    return singles\n\n# query MySQL database returns most relevant paper sentences in dataframe\ndef get_search_table(query):\n    query=query.replace(\" \",\"+\")\n    urls=r\"https://edocdiscovery.com/covid_19/covid_19_search_api.php?search_string=\"+query\n    table = pd.read_csv(urls,encoding= 'unicode_escape')\n    return table\n\n# BERT pretrained question answering module\ndef answer_question(question,text):\n    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n    model = BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad')\n    input_text = \"[CLS] \" + question + \" [SEP] \" + text + \" [SEP]\"\n    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text)\n    token_type_ids = [0 if i <= input_ids.index(102) else 1 for i in range(len(input_ids))]\n    start_scores, end_scores = model(torch.tensor([input_ids]), token_type_ids=torch.tensor([token_type_ids]))\n    all_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids)\n    #print(' '.join(all_tokens[torch.argmax(start_scores) : torch.argmax(end_scores)+1]))\n    answer=(' '.join(all_tokens[torch.argmax(start_scores) : torch.argmax(end_scores)+1]))\n    #
