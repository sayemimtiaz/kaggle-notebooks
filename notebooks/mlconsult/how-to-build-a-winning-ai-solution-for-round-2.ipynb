The good news is, many people have been successful getting answers to question from the text of the documents and some folks have had success getting data to fill the review tables. This notebook will discuss and give you an overview of some of the solutions to table filling that I have built and seen and then will demonstrate some techniques for how to make calculations that will be needed to win round 2 - I hope this helps.\n\n**As you read this, particulalry the table extraction section, keep in mind that it sounds like AI2 will extract the table data from the papers and that the table data will be provided in the document files.  However, it is unclear how the table data will be presented in the dataset and regardless, we will still have to be able to extract that data. In addition, my STRONG belief is that a true AI solution MUST be able to deal with raw PDF documents and extract the data to answer questions and fill tables just like a human researcher - so I wanted to put this out there in hopes it helps me or someone else win round 2 and/or inspires someone to create something cool and useful - this is the fun stuff **\n\n\n# Successful Round 1 solutions answering questions\n\nHere is a link to all the round 1 [winning solutions](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/discussion/148807) so you can see the approaches, the results and how they were implemented. I think round 2 will not have much question answering and will be based on \"table filling\" discussed below - the only thing I think that will carry over from round 1 is the task topic/questions.\n\n# Secret to winning solution for round 2 is - Table Filling\n\nTo have a winning submission for round 2, your agent is going to have to fill review tables.  Currenlty, there are two types of tables that we have been attempting to fill in data - Risk Factors and Key Scientific questions.\n\n**Here are examples of columns of tables that will need to be filled with an explanation of what it is and where to find it - this example is for a risk factor table see link below to cancer risk factor table:\n**\n\n- Date: this is the publication date of the paper which is in the metadata.csv file.\n- Title: Title of the paper also in the metadata.csv file.\n- URL: this is http://doi.org/ + the DOI column from the metadata.csv file\n- Journal - name of the publication the paper is in - from the metadata.csv file\n- Severe is the odds ratio discussed below (or other ratio HR AR etc.) for patients that have severe cases vs. not with hypertension - example of odds ratio - hypertension: or = 2.72, 95% ci (1.60,4.64), p = 0.0002;\n- Severe lower ratio: would be the 1.60 for this example OR\n- Severe upper ratio: is 4.64 for this example\n- Severe p-value: here the p value is 0.0002 (P < 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference between groups. P > 0.05 indicates there is not a statistically significant difference between groups)\n- severe statistically significant: if the range contains 1, the differences in the severe group and not is not statistically significant - if 1 is not in the range, then it is statistically significant.\n- severe adjusted: was it adjusted for age of the patients?\n- severe calculated or extracted - was the OR extracted from the paper or calculated\n- Then you will see that the exact same columns are repeated for fatalities - so you use the same analysis above just fatal or not fatal instead of severe case or not sever case. If available in the paper.\n- Design: this is the type of study used in creating the paper - here is a link that discusses this https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/discussion/139355\n- Sample: this is simply how many patients or cases were included in the study - @davidmezetti has done very good work on this. https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/discussion/140185\n- Study Population: this is the bigger picture of where the sample came from - All symptomatic patients who tested positive in Reggio from February 27 to April 2, 2020.\n\n\nNote on Statistical Significance\nIf an odds ratio (OR) is 1, it means there is no association between the exposure and outcome.  So, if the 95% confidence interval for an OR includes 1, it means the results are not statistically significant.  Example, exposure to colored vs white Christmas lights was associated with an increase in jocularity score, OR = 1.2 (95%CI 0.98-1.45).  Sorry, this is not statistically significant.  Let’s just go with white lights…\n\n\n\nTo see a review table like just discusssed - here is a link to a risk factor table for cancer like one AI agent will need to fill\n[risk factor cancer](https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/aipowered-literature-review-csvs#Cancer.csv)\n\nHere is a link to a key scientific question table that an AI agent will have to fill:\n[Air Temperature Effect Covid-19](https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/aipowered-literature-review-csvs#Air%20Temperature%20and%20COVID%20.csv)\n\nHere is an example of key scientific question table filling by [@davidmezetti](https://www.kaggle.com/davidmezzetti) - he has done amazing work on and is the best at sample size and study type as well as the amazing excerpts his solution have returned. [scientific question table filling](https://www.kaggle.com/davidmezzetti/cord-19-risk-factors)\n\nHere is a good table filling example by [@ajrwhite](https://www.kaggle.com/ajrwhite) [smoking risk factor](https://www.kaggle.com/ajrwhite/covid-19-risk-factors-smoking)\n\nHere is pretty good example of the [incubation period table filler](https://www.kaggle.com/mlconsult/incubation-period-ai-lit-review-w-table) that I built.\n\nTo have a winning solution for round 2, our AI agents will have to be able to fill these types of tables as completely as possible - the problem becomes all the needed data is not in the text of the document as discussed below.\n\n# Pseudo Code for a winning AI solution for round 2 COMING SOON\n** will add Pseudo code with links to notebooks that will help you build your winning AI agent**\n\n\n# Risk Factors, OR and other useful data\n\n**Any of the medical folks, please feel free to correct my on this if I mis-state anything.**\n\nTo fill tables you have to understand risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking etc. and if they make the COVID19 disease worse or deadly.  Researchers want to know an important ratio called the odds ratio (OR).  The problem is, in the scientific papers, this ratio is not always laid out in the text and often the raw data to calculate the OR is contained in one of many tables in a paper - so we have to teach agents to analyze the table data and choose the correct table, then extract the proper data, understanding if it is severity or fatality related or both and then extract or calculate the appropriate OR or ratio.  Here is a link to an odds ratio extractor that shows how to get the OR (and other ratios) from the text of the papers. https://www.kaggle.com/mlconsult/simple-odds-ratio-extractor so you can see them in live papers.\n\nSimply put, the OR is a way to present the strength of association between risk factors/exposures and outcomes.  If the OR is <1, odds are decreased for an outcome; OR >1 means the odds are increased for a given outcome.  Let’s look at the examples again and consider odds.\n\nOdds ratios are often shown in this format:\n\nhypertension: or = 2.72, 95% ci (1.60,4.64), p = 0.0002;\n\nthanks to [@savannareid](https://www.kaggle.com/savannareid) for making this all easier to understand - here is a link to some of @savannareid hard work https://www.kaggle.com/covid-19-contributions#Hypertension\n\nHere is a calculator to help you understand how to calculate the odds ratio. https://www.medcalc.org/calc/odds_ratio.php  We will dig into this calculation further once we have extracted useful data from the tables.  Instead of infected vs. noninfected, we will mostly be interested in severe vs. non-severe disease or fatal vs. not fatal (alive) for people with the underlying risk factor.\n\nFor the explanation below, [@savannareid](https://www.kaggle.com/savannareid) used this paper https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2763184\n\n- So for that paper you want the frequencies in Table 3 - table 3 is below here.\n\n- 16 of 117 patients without ARDS had hypertension, whereas 23 of 84 patients with ARDS had hypertension\n\n- so in the medcalc odds ratio calculator, a=23, b=(84-23)=61, c=16, d=(117-16)=101. OR= 2.38 (95% CI: 1.17 - 4.85)\n\nTo read more about calculating and understanding the OR see this page - https://journalfeed.org/article-a-day/2018/idiots-guide-to-odds-ratios\n\n**Now, as you can imagine, there can be multiple tables in each paper and the tables can be all over the map design wise, so this is just an experiment to start getting ahead of the task to work with table data. Even if the table data is pre-extracted to CSV or other format, there will need to be an understanding of how to manipulate the desired data to provide the desired statisitics.**\n\n![TABLE 3](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/intemed/0/ioi200022t3.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=VeyowRn~q8NcwYqtg4tCkVDkTU54N-m3rZC87DsvXGvE6~466MKXNzSc6DAE73woxWZ2-0tIt1duzPQDNZR~IwpffvadfMbZyT-8n~oOfDX3SgfJXu~6TUeMDfj18QWJvHJ9bf2rpjvM8hDXqWerkTGh~JhCMufLcqpNtDxcAIFvr6X66M5wBN2WpXcswjYgACkKka6BCo5Vjmv1vRtdokbp8fr2HvcQwF8QX-1fbgdK4gtymk09IUFFCGIF8balrEKhvntRdxBJRfA7l5uCnKSrTwkrIQhjL9SOEvYNH58wyaYRdKDvLVR2mV-1LbHa-RGBTopqa-Z3VtrYSKjGFg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)\n\n# So now let's try and extract some data from a paper's table \n\nWe will load the tabula-py and the other packages needed to get the table data into dataframes\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install tabula-py\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tabula import read_pdf,convert_into\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('packages loaded')\nprint('')\nfile='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067587v1.full.pdf'\nprint ('this is the document we are testing ', file)\nprint('')\ntables = read_pdf(file, pages = 'all', multiple_tables = True)\n\nprint('tables extracted')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Now we will return the table data from the PDF and learn how many tables were returned","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.core.display import display, HTML\n\noutput='table dataframes returned '+str(len(tables))\ndisplay(HTML('<h3>'+output+'</h3>'))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Now we can isolate tables that have our risk factor or other topic we are interested in - for this example hypertension\n\n- the system can quickly analyze ten tables and return the only line item from the table that has the risk factor we are interested in.\n\n# Table 1 example\n\n2020-04-22 - Impact of blood analysis and immune function on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (medRxiv)\n\nBenchmark(s): fatality: † § OR 1.96, 95%CI: (0.62,6.23); p=0.26","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"i=0\n\ndf_names=['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L']\n\nfor table in tables:\n    df='df'+df_names[i]\n    df = pd.DataFrame(table)\n    df=df.fillna('missing data')\n    df=df[df[df.columns[0]].str.lower().str.contains('hypertension')]\n    if df.empty==False:\n        df_table_show=HTML(df.to_html(escape=False,index=False))\n        display(df_table_show)\n    i=i+1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Now let's extract a few more tables from other articles to help understand formats\n\nTo get to a point where we understand how the table data is formatted, we need to examine a few more tables to see differences and similarities.
