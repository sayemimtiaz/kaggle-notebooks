Spasticity was defined by Jim Lance in 1980, as a velocity-dependent increase in muscle stretch reflexes associated with increased muscle tone as a component of upper motor neuron syndrome. Spasticity has a wide range of etiologies, including brain injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, trauma, and spinal cord injury. \n\n\"In 1964, Bryan Ashworth published the Ashworth Scale as a method of grading spasticity while working with multiple sclerosis patients. The original Ashworth scale was a 5 point numerical scale that graded spasticity from 0 to 4, with 0 being no resistance and 4 being a limb rigid in flexion or extension. In 1987, while performing a study to exam interrater reliability of manual tests of elbow flexor muscle spasticity, Bohannon and Smith modified the Ashworth scale by adding 1+ to the scale to increase sensitivity. Since its modification, the modified Ashworth scale (MAS), has been applied in clinical practice and research as a measure of spasticity. The modified Ashworth scale purpose is to grade muscle spasticity.\"\n\n0: No increase in muscle tone\n\n1: Slight increase in muscle tone, with a catch and release or minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when an affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension.\n\n1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested as a catch, followed by minimal resistance through the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion.\n\n2: A marked increase in muscle tone throughout most of the range of motion, but affected part(s) are still easily moved.\n\n3: Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.\n\n4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554572/#:~:text=In%201964%2C%20Bryan%20Ashworth%20published,rigid%20in%20flexion%20or%20extension."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/end-als/end-als/clinical-data/filtered-metadata/metadata/clinical/Ashworth_Spasticity_Scale.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% / 10% 40%\">Correlation of falls in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with objective measures of balance, strength, and spasticity</h1>\n\nAuthors: Wendy E.

Prepublished online 2019 Jan 29. doi: 10.3233/NRE-182531\n\n\"Persons diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) often demonstrate neurological deficits that predispose them to repeated falls and associated adverse consequences. Determining contributing factors to falls in this population is critical to improve safety and patient outcomes.\"\n\n\"The purpose of that study was to correlate clinical measures of gait speed, balance, strength, spasticity, and a self-reported rating scale of function with fall incidence in individuals with ALS.\"\n\n\"METHODS:\nThirty-one participants with a confirmed ALS diagnosis were recruited from an outpatient clinic. Each participant performed the following tests: timed gait speed, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), manual muscle testing (MMT) for lower extremity (LE) strength, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) for LE spasticity, and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). Each participant reported number of falls that occurred in the past three months. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between variables.\"\n\n\"In conclusion, LE (lower extremity) strength was determined to have a significant positive relationship with number of recent falls within the past three months reported by people with ALS. The authors believe the study contributes to the body of literature that exists to inform clinicians and the community about functional limitations and safety considerations for individuals with ALS.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6398543/"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Location and severity of Spasticity.\n\nThe location of spasticity in terms of upper and lower limb involvement is shown.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):cannabidiol (CBD) oromucosal spray (THC:CBD), approved for the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis, serves as a complementary off-label treatment option in ALS-related spasticity. However, few structured data are available on THC:CBD in the treatment of spasticity in ALS.\"\n\n\"THC:CBD is used in a wide dose range suggesting that the drug was applied on the basis of individual patients’ needs and preferences. Contributing to this notion, moderate to severe spasticity was associated with an elevated number of daily THC:CBD actuations and stronger recommendation rate (NPS) as compared to patients with mild spasticity. \n\nOverall, treatment satisfaction (TSQM-9) was high. The results suggest that THC:CBD may serve as a valuable addition in the spectrum of symptomatic therapy in ALS. However, prospective studies and head-to-head comparisons to other spasticity medications are of interest to further explore the effectiveness of THC:CBD in the management of spasticity, and other ALS-related symptoms.\"\n\nhttps://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-019-1443-y"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#A8A8A8; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% / 10% 40%\"></h1>"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
