Dean - Science  13 Nov 2020: Vol. 370, Issue 6518, pp. 763-765\nDOI: 10.1126/science.abe5938\n\nThe elderly and people with comorbidities are at greatest risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A safe and effective vaccine could help to protect these groups in two distinct ways: direct protection, where high-risk groups are vaccinated to prevent disease, and indirect protection, where those in contact with high-risk individuals are vaccinated to reduce transmission.\n\n### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\"> Direct and Indirect Protection </font></mark></b>\n\n\nInfluenza vaccine campaigns initially targeted the elderly, in an effort at direct protection, but more recently have focused on the general population, in part to enhance indirect protection. Because influenza vaccines induce weaker, shorter-lived immune responses in the elderly than in young adults, increasing indirect protection may be a more effective strategy. It is unknown whether the same is true for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\n<font color=\"#9B59B6\">How, and How well, these Vaccines work and in Which groups of people?</font>\n\nFor COVID-19, age-structured mathematical models with realistic contact patterns are being used to explore different vaccination plans, with the recognition that vaccine doses may be limited at first and so should be deployed strategically. But as supplies grow large enough to contemplate an indirect protection strategy, the recommendations of these models depend on the details of how, and how well, these vaccines work and in which groups of people. How can the evidence needed to inform strategic decisions be generated for COVID-19 vaccines?\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6518/763"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Mcintyre4/publication/9080141/figure/fig3/AS:651514842464256@1532344651114/Formula-for-assessing-vaccine-effectiveness-using-screening-method.png)researchgate.net"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <font color=\"#E74C3C\">Codes by Radoslav Kirkov https://www.kaggle.com/rkirkov/bcg-vaccine-strain-types</font>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/BCG-Strain.csv', encoding='utf8')\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\"> Phase 3 vaccine trials </font></mark></b>\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Individual-level Efficacy and safety  </font>\n\n\nPhase 3 vaccine trials are designed to assess individual-level efficacy and safety. These trials typically focus on a primary endpoint of virologically confirmed, symptomatic disease to capture the direct benefit of the vaccine that forms the basis for regulatory decisions.\n\nSecondary endpoints, such as infection or viral shedding, provide supporting data, along with analyses of vaccine efficacy in subgroups. Nonetheless, unanswered questions about COVID-19 vaccine characteristics are likely to remain even after trials are completed.\n\nFirst, trials are typically not powered to establish subgroup-specific efficacy, yet the performance of the vaccine in high-risk groups affects the success of a direct-protection strategy. Second, can vaccines prevent infection or reduce contagiousness? This matters for achieving indirect protection. Expanding ongoing efforts or planning new studies may generate the data needed to address these questions.\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\"> Estimating Subgroup-Specific Efficacy  </font>\n\nFor estimating subgroup-specific efficacy, randomized controlled trials can provide early estimates, yet these will have wide confidence intervals, leaving substantial uncertainty about true effects in high-risk subgroups. This uncertainty would be greater in interim analyses that are based on the number of events across the whole trial population and may be exacerbated if high-risk participants are more cautious and have lower exposure to infection, reducing their contribution to the efficacy estimates.\n\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6518/763"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig ,ax = plt.subplots(2,2,figsize=(16,16))\nax1,ax2,ax3,ax4 = ax.flatten()\nsns.countplot(data=df,x='Resistance to TCH\\n1',hue='T Cell Epitopes Group 3',palette='gist_rainbow',ax=ax1)\nsns.countplot(data=df,x='Catalase (room temperature)\\nBubble column \\n(mm)',hue='T Cell Epitopes Group 3',palette='viridis',ax=ax2)\nsns.countplot(data=df,x='Resistance to TCH\\n10',hue='T Cell Epitopes Group 3',palette='viridis',ax=ax3)\nsns.countplot(data=df,x='Catalase (room temperature)\\nActivity',hue='T Cell Epitopes Group 3',palette='gist_rainbow',ax=ax4)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Strategies to address Subgroup-Specific Efficacy </font>\n\nThere are several strategies to address subgroup-specific efficacy, some of them already in place. Ensuring that high-risk adults are well represented in the trial population can be achieved by setting minimum enrollment targets for older adults and/or adults with comorbidities.\n\nAnother consideration relates to the stopping rules for interim analyses in trials. Vaccine trials with early interim analyses that are planning to discontinue randomization and vaccinate placebo participants after declaring efficacy are most prone to subgroup uncertainty. \n\nTo improve the precision of efficacy estimates in high-risk subgroups, regulators could insist that interim analyses be performed only after a certain number of confirmed disease cases occur in these subgroups, in addition to existing monitoring of the overall number of events in the study.\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Blinded follow-up </font>\n\nTrials that maintain blinded follow-up to assess long-term efficacy and safety may also generate more-reliable evidence on age-specific effects. For example, the World Health Organization's Solidarity Vaccines Trial will preserve placebo-controlled follow-up through month 12 or when an effective vaccine is deployed locally.\n\nHowever, depending on where the trials are being done and whether the vaccine becomes rapidly available in sufficient quantities after emergency-use authorization in the population undergoing the trial, it may become unethical and/or impractical to ask participants in some subgroups to forego access to an available vaccine.\n\nFor vaccine candidates evaluated in multiple trials, such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being studied in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and the United States, meta-analyses can synthesize results across locations to improve precision of subgroup-specific effect estimates.\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6518/763"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get the latest BCG vaccine policy information for each contry\nbcg_strain_country_policy = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/hackathon/task_2-BCG_strain_per_country-8Nov2020.csv', delimiter=',')\nbcg_strain_country_policy.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\"> Regulatory Approval, Deployment and Postapproval studies. </font>\n\nIdeally, the phase 3 trials in progress will identify more than one safe, effective vaccine for regulatory approval and deployment.\n\nPostapproval studies will then take on an important role for continued assessment of vaccine effectiveness. These may include individual- or community-level randomized trials to compare different active vaccines without a control arm, as in the U.S. Department of Defense's individually randomized Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the DoD (PAIVED) trial, which assesses the relative merits of three licensed influenza vaccines (NCT03734237).\n\nAnother approach to amass evidence on subgroup-specific efficacy is post-approval observational studies.This includes active surveillance of high-priority cohorts from, for example, nursing homes or assisted living facilities, as has been done for influenza. \n\nThis also includes test-negative designs, which are routinely used to assess vaccine effectiveness.

Relationship between Viral Loads and Infectiousness </font>\n\nA key limitation of observational studies is confounding. There may be many differences between individuals who do and do not get vaccinated, which may create noncausal correlations between vaccine status and outcomes. Although such biases can threaten any observational study of vaccine effectiveness, there are some approaches to detect such biases and reduce their magnitude.\n\nThe clearest evidence of indirect protection is from a vaccine that prevents infection entirely, thereby reducing transmission. These data will be generated in efficacy trials that include infection as a secondary endpoint. This endpoint is measured by a specialized assay to distinguish an infection-induced response from a vaccine-induced antibody response.\n\nA vaccine can provide indirect protection even if it does not fully prevent infection . Vaccines that reduce disease severity can also reduce infectiousness by reducing viral shedding and/or symptoms that increase viral spread (e.g., coughing and sneezing). A worst-case scenario is a vaccine that reduces disease while permitting viral shedding; this could fail to reduce transmission or conceivably even increase transmission if it suppressed symptoms.\n\nTo assess a vaccine's impact on infectiousness, some phase 3 trials examine the amount or duration of viral shedding in laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic participants by home collection of saliva samples and frequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. However, this would not capture any change in viral shedding for asymptomatic participants.\n\nMoreover, serology tests detect previous infection and cannot reconstruct shedding during active infection. To measure viral load in both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, it is necessary to conduct frequent (e.g., weekly) viral testing, irrespective of symptoms, to capture participants during their period of acute infectiousness. \n\nEven weekly testing will not give detailed information about the effect of the vaccine on viral shedding, and the relationship between viral loads and infectiousness is unknown; nonetheless, this approach is likely to provide some evidence if viral loads are on average lower among vaccinated people. Human challenge vaccine studies, in which individuals in a randomized controlled trial are deliberately exposed to the virus, could generate high-quality data on the effect of vaccines on viral shedding.\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6518/763"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get the COVID-19 mortality statistics\ncovid_death_cases = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/hackathon/task_2-COVID-19-death_cases_per_country_after_fifth_death-till_22_September_2020.csv', delimiter=',')\ncovid_death_cases.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Long-term Safety. Duration of Protection. Efficacy. </font>\n\nOther open questions about the rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccines include long-term safety (indicating the critical need for pharmacovigilance activities), the duration of vaccine protection, the efficacy of a partial vaccination series or of lower doses, the vaccine's level of protection against severe infection and death, efficacy by baseline serostatus, and the potential for the virus to evolve to escape vaccine-induced immunity. The answers to such questions inform the optimal use of any vaccine.\n\nAvailability of a COVID-19 vaccine will initially be limited, and so several expert committees are exploring strategic prioritization plans. \n\nHealth care workers are a common first-tier group, which in turn preserves health care systems by protecting those who run them . \n\nA next priority is to directly protect those who are at highest risk of death or hospitalization when infected: specifically, those over 65 and people with certain comorbid conditions. This strategy may be optimal for reducing mortality even if the vaccine is somewhat less effective in these groups. But if a vaccine offers little to no protection in high-risk groups yet is able to reduce infection or infectiousness in younger adults, an indirect strategy could be preferred as vaccine supplies become large enough.\n\nA worst-case scenario for an effective vaccine is one that reduces disease in younger adults but provides neither direct nor indirect protection to high-risk groups, leaving the most vulnerable at risk. Knowing these vaccine characteristics is important when evaluating the relative merits of other products. Fortunately, there are many vaccine candidates in development that use a mixture of innovative and existing technologies. Although vaccines may vary in their characteristics, having reliable evidence on direct and indirect protection can help plan how to use these vaccines in a coordinated way.\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6518/763"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get country related information which might be useful for the COVID-19 analysis, e.g. income group, median age, \ncountry_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/hackathon/BCG_country_data.csv', delimiter=',')\ncountry_data.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#GRAPHIC: KELLIE HOLOSKI/SCIENCE\n\n![](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6518/763/F1.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1)https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6518/763"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get \"alpha 2 code\" for each country in covid_death_cases\ncovid_death_cases_country = pd.merge(covid_death_cases, country_data, left_on='alpha_3_code',right_on='alpha_3_code',how='left',\n        suffixes=('_left','_right'))\ncovid_death_cases_country[[\"country_name_left\", \n                            \"alpha_2_code\", \n                            \"alpha_3_code\",                             \n                            \"deaths_per_million_50_days_after_fifth_death\", \n                            \"deaths_per_million_100_days_after_fifth_death\", \n                            \"deaths_per_million_150_days_after_fifth_death\"]].tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Randomized Controlled Trials and Observational Studies. </font>\n\nHow do we measure how well influenza vaccines work? Two general types of studies are used to determine how well vaccines work: randomized controlled trials and observational studies.\n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs)\n\nThe first type of study design is called a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a RCT, volunteers are assigned randomly to receive a vaccine or a placebo (e.g., a shot of saline). Vaccine efficacy is measured by comparing the frequency of influenza illness in the vaccinated and the unvaccinated (placebo) groups. The RCT study design minimizes bias that could lead to invalid study results. Bias is an unintended systematic error in the way researchers select study participants, measure outcomes, or analyze data that can lead to inaccurate results. In a RCT, vaccine allocation is usually double-blinded, which means neither the study volunteers nor the researchers know if a given person has received vaccine or placebo. National regulatory authorities, require RCTs to be conducted and to demonstrate the protective benefits of a new vaccine before the vaccine is licensed for routine use. However, some vaccines are licensed based on RCTs that use antibody response to the vaccine as measured in the laboratory, rather than decreases in influenza disease among people who were vaccinated.\n\nObservational Studies\n\nThe second type of study design is an observational study. There are several types of observational studies, including cohort and case-control studies. Observational studies assess how influenza vaccines work by comparing the occurrence of influenza among people who have been vaccinated compared to people not vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness is the percent reduction in the frequency of influenza illness among vaccinated people compared to people not vaccinated, usually with adjustment for factors (like presence of chronic medical conditions) that are related to both influenza illness and vaccination. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectivenessqa.htm"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Merge country, covid-19 and bcg policy information\ncovid_death_cases_bcg_strain = pd.merge(covid_death_cases_country, df_country_policy, left_on='alpha_2_code',right_on='country_code',how='left',suffixes=('_left','_right'))\ncovid_death_cases_bcg_strain.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"#E74C3C\">How do vaccine effectiveness studies differ from vaccine efficacy studies? </font>\n\nVaccine efficacy refers to vaccine protection measured in RCTs usually under optimal conditions where vaccine storage and delivery are monitored and participants are usually healthy.

Both fractions were small, but the fraction of unvaccinated volunteers who got sick was much bigger than the fraction of vaccinated ones. The scientists then determined the relative difference between those two fractions. Scientists express that difference with a value they call efficacy.

But if previous vaccines are any guide, effectiveness may prove somewhat lower.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cats = [c for c in covid_death_cases_bcg_strain_filtered[[\n    \"country_name_left\",     \n    \"population_per_km2\",\n    \"mandatory_bcg_strain_2015_2020\", \n    \"Class\", \"T_Cell_Epitopes_Group_3\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_50_days_after_fifth_death\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_100_days_after_fifth_death\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_150_days_after_fifth_death\"]].columns if covid_death_cases_bcg_strain_filtered[[\n    \"country_name_left\",     \n    \"population_per_km2\",\n    \"mandatory_bcg_strain_2015_2020\", \n    \"Class\", \"T_Cell_Epitopes_Group_3\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_50_days_after_fifth_death\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_100_days_after_fifth_death\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_150_days_after_fifth_death\"]][c].dtypes == 'object']\nnums = [c for c in covid_death_cases_bcg_strain_filtered[[\n    \"country_name_left\",     \n    \"population_per_km2\",\n    \"mandatory_bcg_strain_2015_2020\", \n    \"Class\", \"T_Cell_Epitopes_Group_3\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_50_days_after_fifth_death\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_100_days_after_fifth_death\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_150_days_after_fifth_death\"]].columns if c not in cats]\ncats","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What exactly are these vaccines effective at doing?\n\nThe clinical trials run by Pfizer and other companies were specifically designed to see whether vaccines protect people from getting sick from Covid-19. If volunteers developed symptoms like a fever or cough, they were then tested for the coronavirus.\n\nBut there’s abundant evidence that people can get infected with the coronavirus without ever showing symptoms. And so it’s possible that a number of people who got vaccinated in the clinical trials got infected, too, without ever realizing it. If those cases indeed exist, none of them are reflected in the 95 percent efficacy rate.\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Stop taking safety measures: Chances of spreading the coronavirus to others could increase. </font>\n\nPeople who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus to others. Some studies suggest that they produce fewer viruses, making them less of a threat than infected people who go on to develop symptoms. But if people get vaccinated and then stop wearing masks and taking other safety measures, their chances of spreading the coronavirus to others could increase.\n\nWill these vaccines put a dent in the epidemic?\n\nVaccines don’t protect only the people who get them. Because they slow the spread of the virus, they can, over time, also drive down new infection rates and protect society as a whole.\n\nScientists call this broad form of effectiveness a vaccine’s impact. The smallpox vaccine had the greatest impact of all, driving the virus into oblivion in the 1970s. But even a vaccine with extremely high efficacy in clinical trials will have a small impact if only a few people end up getting it.\n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">Vaccination Programs save lives </font>\n\n“Vaccines don’t save lives,”  “Vaccination programs save lives.”\n\nDr. Paltiel and his colleagues published a study in the journal Health Affairs in which they simulated the coming rollout of coronavirus vaccines. They modeled vaccines with efficacy rates ranging from high to low, but also considered how quickly and widely a vaccine could be distributed as the pandemic continues to rage.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"target = covid_death_cases_bcg_strain_filtered[[\n    \"country_name_left\",     \n    \"population_per_km2\",\n    \"mandatory_bcg_strain_2015_2020\", \n    \"Class\", \"T_Cell_Epitopes_Group_3\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_50_days_after_fifth_death\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_100_days_after_fifth_death\", \n    \"deaths_per_million_150_days_after_fifth_death\"]].pop('mandatory_bcg_strain_2015_2020')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The results, Dr. Paltiel said, were heartbreaking.
