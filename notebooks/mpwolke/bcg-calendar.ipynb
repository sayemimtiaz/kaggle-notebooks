Signals of BCG vaccination effect on COVID-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed. That study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to protect from severe COVID-19.\n\nThey reviewed evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refined the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; P = 8 × 10−7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected there, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 were discussed.https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/07/2008410117","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/task_2-BCG_world_atlas_data-bcg_strain-7July2020.csv', encoding='utf8')\ndf1.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Even though the BCG vaccine has been in use for more than 90 years, with proven safety, its efficacy is still controversial. BCG vaccination has shown clear protection in children, but, in adults, its effects have been inconsistent. Many countries initiated national BCG vaccination in the middle of the twentieth century with variable levels of coverage using different BCG strains, number of doses, and delivery method.\n\nAs the prevalence of TB decreased, countries like France, Germany, and Spain stopped mass vaccination of children and moved to vaccinate only individuals at high risk. Other countries like Russia, Ukraine, and China have continued national BCG vaccination to date. Some countries never established national universal BCG vaccination, including the United States and Italy, and only target high-risk individuals.https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/07/2008410117","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nsns.countplot(df1['vaccination_timing'],linewidth=3,palette=\"Set2\",edgecolor='black')\nplt.title('Vaccination Timing')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nfigsize=(16, 10)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There is ample epidemiological evidence that BCG vaccination has broad protective effects that are not specific to M. tuberculosis infection. For example, in 1927, Swedish children who received BCG vaccination at birth had a mortality rate almost threefold lower than unvaccinated children. This decrease of mortality could not be explained by TB infection, and thus, early on, it was suggested that the very low mortality among BCG-vaccinated children may be caused by nonspecific immunity.\n\nIn West Africa, a BCG vaccination scar and a positive tuberculin reaction were associated with better survival during early childhood in an area with high mortality; this was not observed with other childhood vaccines. A general reduction in neonatal mortality linked to BCG vaccination was also reported in children from Guinea-Bissau, mainly due to fewer cases of neonatal sepsis, respiratory infection, and fever. The BCG vaccine appears to confer broad enhanced immunity to respiratory infections, as infants from Guinea-Bissau with acute viral infections of the lower respiratory tract were more likely to not have received BCG vaccination than matched controls.\n\nIn Spain, hospitalizations due to respiratory infections in 0- to 14-y-old children not attributable to TB were significantly lower in BCG-vaccinated compared to non-BCG-vaccinated children. The observation that this protection was still present in 14-y-old children suggests that the broad protective effect of BCG can be long lasting. Taken together, our current understanding of broad immune protection mediated by trained immunity and the epidemiologic evidence of long-lasting protection from viral infections of the respiratory tract, conferred by BCG vaccination, offer a rational biological basis for the potential protective effect of BCG vaccination from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/07/2008410117","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nsns.countplot(df1['were_revaccinations_recommended'],linewidth=3,palette=\"Set2\",edgecolor='black')\nplt.title('Were Revaccinations Recommended?')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nfigsize=(16, 10)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Considering the cross-protection reported for BCG vaccination on viral respiratory infections, recent publications have proposed that BCG vaccination could have protective effects against COVID-19 infection.

M. tuberculosis infection can remain latent for decades and reactivate in the elderly when a senescent immune system loses the ability to contain the infection. Nevertheless, a small study found that vaccination of adults ≥ 65 y old with BCG prevented acute upper respiratory tract infections, and there is an active clinical trial vaccinating adults aged >65 y with BCG to boost immunity.\n\nIf the BCG protection hypothesis holds true, it would have great implications for regions with ongoing universal vaccination programs, including most developing countries, as they may experience lower morbidity and mortality during the pandemic than in Europe and North America. They found that the number of years that universal BCG vaccination has been implemented in a given country and the level of vaccination coverage may play key roles in reducing of COVID-19 severity. \n\nSimilarly, individuals born in years with low BCG vaccine coverage would be populations at risk. Most Asian countries have active universal BCG vaccination programs. If BCG is conferring some basal level of protection from COVID-19, it is possible that some of the social distancing roll-back strategies taken by Asian countries, in order to restart their economies, may not be effective in North America and western European countries, and could result in a second wave of infections.\n\nThe understanding of the biology of innate immune training is in its infancy . Little is known about the capacity of BCG vaccination to confer broad immune enhancement and the functional correlates of protection. The inability to confirm the null hypothesis of no effect of BCG on COVID-19 mortality could be explained by an alternative hypothesis of cross-protection mediated by BCG vaccination. They note, however, that the data used in that epidemiological study have important sampling biases, and that the statistical signal detected at the country level may not explain COVID-19 mortality at the local level. The possibility that a single exposure to an attenuated pathogen during infancy could result in lifelong enhancement in immune surveillance is remarkable, but the available epidemiological data, in the absence of direct evidence from clinical trials, is not sufficient to recommend the use of BCG for the control and prevention of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious diseases.https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/07/2008410117","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata  @mpwolke ","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
