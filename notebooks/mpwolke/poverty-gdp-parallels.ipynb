The report introduces the indicators of safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, which go beyond use of improved facilities, to include consideration of the quality of services provided. For the first time, hygiene estimates are reported for 70 countries. https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/jmp-2017/en","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTLA7Mdz9Q49AMLvCbiK1SRFimx-ur3u3Iwhg&usqp=CAU)\n\nslideplayer.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/task_2-owid_covid_data-21_June_2020.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Brazilian Senate approves new legal framework for basic sanitation in Brazil\n\nby Eliane Oliveira and Manoel Ventura,24/06/2020. \n\nThe measure, approved by the Chamber at the end of last year , may open up more space for private agents and attract investments in the sector. \n\nThe project must change a dramatic picture: more than half of the Brazilian population has `no treated sewage` and about 35 million Brazilians do `not have access to drinking water.`\n\nThe estimate by the government and private sector experts is that around R $ 700 billion will be needed for this situation to be corrected by 2033, reducing infrastructure deficiencies that leave 104 million Brazilians `without sewage services`.\n\nThe new sanitation regulatory framework in the country is also seen as important for attracting investments in the post-pandemic. Basic sanitation is the last infrastructure sector that has not been liberalized, unlike segments such as telephony and energy.  \n\nThe text provides for bids for the contracting of water and sewage companies, which opens the way for the entry of private initiative in the sector, which will now compete on equal terms with state-owned companies.\n\nBoth public and private companies will have to meet universalization goals, to be achieved by the end of 2033.

Janssens, H. L. Rieder-European Respiratory Journal 2008 32: 1415-1416; DOI: 10.1183/09031936.00078708 \n\nIn 2006, an estimated 9 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) emerged worldwide 1. Of these, only 1% occurred in the European Union and North America combined, while Africa and South-East Asia contributed >65 per cent. Among the 22 high-burden countries, 17 were in Africa, 16 of which were in the lowest quartile in terms of per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Since 2001, the fight against poverty has been a major theme in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) “Stop TB” strategy. Indeed, poverty “fuels” TB by facilitating transmission through crowded working and living conditions, it may increase the risk of progression to disease through malnutrition, and imposes barriers to accessing health services.\n\nThe World Bank publishes yearly estimates of per capita GDP per country. Similarly, the WHO provides annual estimates for TB incidence for each country by WHO region. Of the 211 WHO member states and 177 countries with reports by the World Bank, there were 171 pairs with information on both GDP and TB. For uniformity of the denominator, United Nations population estimates for 2004 were used to obtain per capita figures for GDP and TB, respectively.\n\nThe choice of the same denominator permitted a direct regression on the numerators (rather than on rates), using population size as a weight. Linear regression on the logarithm of both TB (2004) and GDP (2005) was chosen as the intuitively simplest model. Both unweighted (not shown) and weighted regression gave similar results.\nhttps://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/5/1415","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/32/5/1415/F1.medium.gif)\n\nRelationship between per capita gross domestic product (GDP; Wold Bank data, 2005) and incidence of tuberculosis per 100,000 population. For graphical presentation, the third root of the population (millions) divided by 10 was used to determine the size of the symbols. This arbitrary choice provides a visual appreciation that large sized populations do not bear an excessive weight at the extremes of the axes, but are rather distributed across the entire scale. Both abscissa and ordinate were drawn logarithmically. 1; India; 2: China; 3: UK.https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/5/1415","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://georank.org/assets/photo/gdp-per-capita.png)\n\nhttps://georank.org/articles/gdppc-covid-correlation","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"georank.org -Proof that COVID-19 Data Accuracy depends on countries' development levels\n\nIf COVID-19 data accuracy did not depend on countries' levels of development, then there would be no correlation between the number of countries' confirmed coronavirus cases per 100,000 people and GDP per capita, the Human Freedom Index, or the Corruption Perceptions Index.\n\nA correlation coefficient values range from -1 to 1 and indicate relationships between two variables, where -1 is the absolute negative correlation, 0 is the absence of correlation, and 1 is the absolute correlation.\n\nThere is a strong statistically significant correlation between countries' confirmed COVID-19 cases and GDP per capita.
