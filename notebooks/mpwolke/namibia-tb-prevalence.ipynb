Of the 38,353 who were eligible to participate, 29,495 (76.9%) actually participated in symptom interview and/or CXR screening. This was 86.8% of the desired sample size. Of the participants, 10,884 (36.9%) were eligible for sputum collection based on symptoms, abnormal CXR or inability to perform CXR.\n\nOf the sputum tested in the field, 115 participants had positive results, while 52 had a positive central culture result; 18 had a positive central Xpert result and four had both positive central Xpert and central culture result. In all, 138 participants had positive bacteriological results, but 119 fit the original survey case definition. A revised case definition during the analysis brought this up to 123 individuals. \n\nApplying multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting, the final prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB in Namibia is 465 per 100,000 (95%CI, 340-590), which is within the range previously estimated by WHO. The prevalence is higher in males (643/100,000) than females (304/100,000). According to this survey, the prevalence of TB in Namibia falls within the range previously estimated by the World Health Organisation confirming Namibia’s high TB-burden status. The higher prevalence in males suggests a male-driven TB epidemic, as has been observed in other studies. Targeted interventions need to specifically address TB in males, given both the high prevalence and their lower participation in health-seeking activities. Additionally, the country should invest in strategies to find and treat undiagnosed TB patients, as the majority of TB cases found during this survey were not on\ntreatment.http://www.mhss.gov.na/documents/119527/120633/Namibia+TB+Prevalence+Survey+Report+2019.pdf/d787e607-ccd6-4919-9eef-6cf0307e8cc6","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Numerical features\nNumerical_feat = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].dtypes != 'O']\nprint('Total numerical features: ', len(Numerical_feat))\nprint('\\nNumerical Features: ', Numerical_feat)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Burden of tuberculosis in Namibia\n\nTuberculosis notifications\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease of major public health significance in Namibia.

Despite this decline, Namibia did not reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Stop TB target of reducing incidence by 50% relative to the 1990 levels.

ART coverage has improved to 96% in 2017 owing to revisions to the eligibility criteria for starting ART in HIV-infected TB patients over the years. Figure 8 shows the trends on coverage of HIV care services for TB patients from 2007 to 2017 in Namibia.\n\n#Drug Resistant Tuberculosis\n\nThe first anti-TB drug resistance survey conducted in 2008-9 showed a Multi Drug resistant-TB (MDRTB) prevalence of 3.8% (95% CI: 2.8%-5.1%) among patients newly diagnosed with TB and 16.5% (95% CI: 13.0%-20.8%) in patients previously treated for TB.\n\nThe second survey in 2014-15 showed the prevalence of MDR-TB to be 3.9% (95% CI: 3.1%-4.7%) among patients newly diagnosed with TB and 9.2% (95% CI: 7.1%-10.3 %) among patients previously treated for TB. In 2017, Namibia reported 417 confirmed DR-TB cases. This is higher than cases reported in earlier years, which may be attributed to improved diagnosis as the new diagnostic algorithm for TB\nintroduced in 2017 allows more sensitive rapid molecular tests (Xpert MTB/RIF) to be performed on the first sample from all presumptive cases.http://www.mhss.gov.na/documents/119527/120633/Namibia+TB+Prevalence+Survey+Report+2019.pdf/d787e607-ccd6-4919-9eef-6cf0307e8cc6","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"index_str = ['country', 'iso2', 'iso3', 'g_whoregion']\n\nplt.figure(figsize=[30,10])\ni = 1\nfor col in index_str :\n    plt.subplot(4,10,i)\n    sns.scatterplot(x=col, y = 'mdr_died' ,data= df)\n    sns.despine()\n    i = i+1\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The Namibian Health Sector\n\nThe Primary Health Care (PHC) approach guides the formulation and development of health policies in Namibia.

The key guiding principles to realise this reduction are: equity, accessibility, availability, affordability, community involvement, sustainability, inter-sectoral collaboration and quality of care.

The MoHSS has 14 regional health directorates and 35 health districts. The NTLP operates within this hierarchical management framework.

The missed TB cases are generally responsible for the growing spread of TB. Consequently, the high number of TB cases places a burden on health and social services infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, TB cases in Namibia are primarily detected through passive surveillance with infrequent active surveillance among selected groups. While the number of people diagnosed and reported through the country’s surveillance system for TB is well documented, the number of people with active TB at any given time is unknown. There is limited or no data on the following groups:\npatients with TB treated outside the public health sector, patients with symptoms compatible with TB at any given time, including the proportion who are being appropriately investigated, and patients with TB but have not accessed the available health services.\n \nA prevalence survey is the best tool currently available to measure a country’s true TB burden, critical for informing resource allocation and public health interventions. It was, therefore, pertinent that Namibia conducts a TB prevalence survey in order to address knowledge gaps that existed in addressing the national TB burden.http://www.mhss.gov.na/documents/119527/120633/Namibia+TB+Prevalence+Survey+Report+2019.pdf/d787e607-ccd6-4919-9eef-6cf0307e8cc6","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_count(\"mdr_fail\",
