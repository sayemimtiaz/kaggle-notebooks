Work conducted in the basic research laboratory forms the scientific foundation for all subsequent investigation. Applied R&D then moves to the clinical research setting, and from there to pilot production and full-scale manufacture. The vaccine must then be purchased, distributed, and used. Finally, a surveillance system is established to monitor immunization coverage, efficacy, and any adverse health effects related to vaccine administration. The surveillance system also may detect fluctuations in disease incidence or new disease entities requiring a realignment of public health priorities.\n\nIn reality, the stages of vaccine development are not so neatly divided. For instance, although basic research is the starting point, it does not end when applied R&D begins; basic research findings continue to inform the process of vaccine development, even during clinical testing. Likewise, findings at the applied and clinical levels feed observations and questions back to the basic research laboratory.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236428/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/230099_8416ba0822844a159981448dd878f674~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1000,h_500,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/230099_8416ba0822844a159981448dd878f674~mv2.png)eara.eu"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Market and Feasibility\n\nMarket potential and technical feasibility, both of which influence the decision to invest in the development of new or improved vaccines.

Once a basic scientific finding is thought to have significant and practical applications, the research moves on to applied R&D (the exploratory development phase). Much applied research and almost all product-development activity are conducted by private industry. Both biotechnology firms and vaccine manufacturers invest in developing new technologies to deliver and enhance the quality and efficacy of vaccines. Unfortunately, some CVI-specific vaccine technologies (e.g., heat stabilization of viral vaccines) are unlikely to be pursued by U.S. firms, because such technologies would have little comparative advantage in the domestic market.
