Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defences to build protection.

Immunization currently prevents 2-3 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles.\n\nImmunization is a key component of primary health care and an indisputable human right. It’s also one of the best health investments money can buy. Vaccines are also critical to the prevention and control of infectious-disease outbreaks. They underpin global health security and will be a vital tool in the battle against antimicrobial resistance.\n\nYet despite tremendous progress, far too many people around the world – including nearly 20 million infants each year – have insufficient access to vaccines. In some countries, progress has stalled or even reversed, and there is a real risk that complacency will undermine past achievements.\n\nGlobal vaccination coverage – the proportion of the world’s children who receive recommended vaccines – has remained the same over the past few years. https://www.who.int/health-topics/vaccines-and-immunization#tab=tab_1"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS7-Tn41yp--jVq8zMQ3rdaybwqZVG0RjsXGjFWA7ugbmR9b3G-0HT4jOtxX4_mlmLXU_LBXp5sXeM5N7HRbdukcF64n7egPLI&usqp=CAU&ec=45732301)health.baltimorecity.gov"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Vaccination and Immunization\n\nVaccination is an administration used to give vaccines i.e giving oral vaccines or injections to improve immune system development and fight against diseases.\n\nImmunization is the process in which the individual immune system is improved to fight against the infected agents.

The classic schedule for vaccines that target proteins like the spike protein on the surface of this coronavirus, Moore said, is three shots — “prime, prime, boost” — with the second and third shots coming one and six months after the first injection. Each of the first two shots primes the immune system and is typically followed by a modest drop-off in antibodies. The third shot, usually at least six months after the first one, can give long-term protection by boosting the immune system’s memory cells, which by that point have matured and are ready to respond.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/two-shots-covid-vaccine/2020/11/27/b852a19a-2f24-11eb-bae0-50bb17126614_story.html"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(30,10))\nplt.subplot(131)\nsns.countplot(x= 'TIME_PERIOD', data = BCG, palette=\"gist_stern\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.subplot(132)\nsns.countplot(x= 'OBS_VALUE', data = BCG, palette=\"gnuplot\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The coronavirus vaccines\n\n\"The coronavirus vaccines may give headaches, fevers and other unpleasant symptoms — all good signs of the body’s immune system getting to work — but Talbot is concerned they may prevent people from returning for their second dose.\"\n\n\"Motivated people will come back as long as they are properly prepared to do so.\" \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/two-shots-covid-vaccine/2020/11/27/b852a19a-2f24-11eb-bae0-50bb17126614_story.html\n\n\"With multiple vaccines available, It’s right for policymakers to think about which vaccines might work best in which populations,” “This is not unusual: Three different types of flu vaccine in the UK to children, young adults and the elderly are given, as we know that different vaccine platforms work better in different age groups.”\n\n\"The differences (among the Vaccines), if there are differences, might not exist at all and if they exist they may be due to the case definitions and the way the individual studies were done – they weren’t all the same,” “We have evidence that all three of these vaccines work to prevent disease but we do not yet know which of them will work best in the elderly or whether there will be any difference.\" https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/27/different-age-groups-may-get-different-covid-vaccines-experts-say"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Taha07  https://www.kaggle.com/taha07/data-scientists-jobs-analysis-visualization/notebook\n\ncolor = plt.cm.flag(np.linspace(0,1,20))\nBCG[\"TIME_PERIOD\"].value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False).head(20).plot.pie(y=\"Indicator\",colors=color,autopct=\"%0.1f%%\")\nplt.title(\"BCG Time Period\")\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Would there be enough Vaccine for everyone?\n\n\"When FDA first authorizes or approves the use of one or more COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, there may be a limited supply.
