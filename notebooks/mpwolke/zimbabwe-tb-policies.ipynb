When seven babies were stillborn on July 27 at Harare Central Hospital in Zimbabwe, after urgent treatment was delayed because of a nurses' strike, it captured the heart-rending health crisis in the country. But it is nothing new. Stories of chronic drug shortages and avoidable deaths have troubled the country in the past 8 years, and COVID-19 is now worsening the situation.\n\nFor more than a month, 15 000 nurses have been on strike over wages eroded by galloping inflation, and senior doctors have threatened to join them. “This has affected all health-care services…obstetric, dialysis, acute medical and surgical, and chronic HIV care”, “This of course also has affected service delivery for COVID-19—the numbers are rising in Zimbabwe and there is now rapid established community transmission.” As of Aug 10, Zimbabwe has reported 4649 cases of COVID-19, but this is thought to be a large underestimate.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said on July 28 that 200 health workers in Zimbabwe had so far tested positive for COVID-19. Zimbabwe has made significant efforts to prepare for COVID-19. Testing services were expanded, isolation and treatment centres were established in every district, and returning residents were quarantined. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31751-7/fulltext#%20","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Call made for Leaders for a TB free Zimbabwe\n\n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRwhAf69lSsT7ummYYzViAGy9LjYoZWdYp9hA&usqp=CAU)afro.who.int https://www.afro.who.int/news/call-made-leaders-tb-free-zimbabwe","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot\nimport seaborn\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Coronavirus: in Zimbabwe, people risk Covid-19 death just to fetch water\n\nSpread of coronavirus will be harder to control without running water, essential for hygiene.

Microbiol., 14 August 2018 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01858\n\nDifferences in Characteristics Between Relapse and Reinfection Cases\n\nTuberculosis (TB) recurrence can result from either relapse of an original infection or exogenous reinfection with a new strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The aim of this study was to assess the roles of relapse and reinfection among recurrent TB cases characterized by a high prevalence rate of drug-resistant TB within a hospital setting.\n\nFor reinfection cases, reemergence of rifampicin-resistant isolates harboring double gene mutations. In conclusion, their data demonstrate that relapse is a major mechanism leading to TB recurrence. Moreover, male patients are at higher risk for reinfection. The extremely high rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among reinfection cases reflects more successful transmission of MDR-TB strains versus non-resistant strains overall.\n\nPerson chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test were used to compare proportions of patients in each subgroup or rates of drug resistance. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated in the univariate analyses. The multivariate models were carried out by forward stepwise logistic regression procedures to identify factors that independently affected reinfection.\n\nThey further compared characteristics between relapse cases and reinfection cases. Overall, there were significantly more reinfection cases among male versus female patients, indicating that male gender is a risk factor for TB reinfection (OR 95%). In contrast, ages, drug resistant profiles, the presence of comorbidities and the timing of a recurrent episode had no influence on percentage of relapse cases. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01858/full","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Numerical features\nNumerical_feat = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].dtypes != 'O']\nprint('Total numerical features: ', len(Numerical_feat))\nprint('\\nNumerical Features: ', Numerical_feat)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#TB control and early detection among migrants\n\nDesignated by WHO as high TB burden countries, Zimbabwe ranks 17th with an estimated TB incidence rate of 562/100,000. The TB epidemic in Zimbabwe is fuelled by the severe parallel HIV pandemic (adult HIV prevalence rate 15.2%), making TB the second leading cause of death. The TB mortality rate (excluding HIV+TB) is 33/100,000, increasing four-fold among patients with both TB and HIV\n(132/100,000). Seventy percent of people living with TB also have HIV.\n\nZimbabwe has a low coverage of TB diagnostic services with only two TB laboratories offering TB sputum culture microscopy. The other available laboratory facilities are scarce and only conduct smear microscopy which has a lower sensitivity, especially in cases of TB/HIV co-infection and which cannot detect drug resistance. \n\nZimbabwean migrants often do not have access to facilities due to their transient behavior. When crossborder Zimbabwean migrants live in neighboring countries such as Botswana and South Africa, they are particularly hard-to-reach. This is because of the many challenges they may encounter as they try to access health services. For instance: irregular migrants often avoid using public ealth facilities in host countries out of fear of being intercepted and deported; long distances between the health facilities and the main road network affects attendance; negative attitudes of health workers can impact turnout; lack of time, the cost of travel and health services, and opportunity cost also have a negative impact.\n\nIn addition, poverty and a poor understanding of TB disease can cause migrants to put off care seeking. The overcrowded living conditions in host countries render them more susceptible to TB infection. In many cases, presumptive TB cases of this hard-to-reach group are initiated on TB treatment without the requisite  diagnostic tests and with poor follow-up due to their mobility patterns.\n\nEfficiently monitoring TB incidence and prevalence in this population requires innovative approaches and active case finding.\nhttp://www.stoptb.org/assets/documents/global/awards/tbreach/w4docs/International%20Organization%20for%20Migration%20(IOM),%20Zimbabwe.pdf","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes from Viswanadth Bolla  https://www.kaggle.com/viswanadthbolla/female-diabetes-patient-analysis","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n\nfig = make_subplots(rows=3, cols=3, subplot_titles=('hcw_tb_infected', 'pulm_spec_available', 'mdrxdr_fail_morphine', 'pub_new_dx', 'priv_new_dx', 'lf_urine_lam', 'newinc_con_prevtx', 'prevtx_short_rifamycin', 'newrel_ep_mbovis'\n       ))\n\ntrace0= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['hcw_tb_infected'],\n    name=\"hcw_tb_infected\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\ntrace1= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['pulm_spec_available'],\n    name=\"pulm_spec_available\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\ntrace2= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['mdrxdr_fail_morphine'],\n    name=\"mdrxdr_fail_morphine\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\ntrace3= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['pub_new_dx'],\n    name=\"pub_new_dx\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\ntrace4= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['priv_new_dx'],\n    name=\"priv_new_dx\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\ntrace5= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['lf_urine_lam'],\n    name=\"lf_urine_lam\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\ntrace6= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['newinc_con_prevtx'],\n    name=\"newinc_con_prevtx\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\ntrace7= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['prevtx_short_rifamycin'],\n    name=\"prevtx_short_rifamycin\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\ntrace8= go.Histogram(\n    \n    x=df['newrel_ep_mbovis'],\n    name=\"newrel_ep_mbovis\",\n    opacity=0.75\n)\n\nfig.append_trace(trace0,1,1)\nfig.append_trace(trace1,1,2)\nfig.append_trace(trace2,1,3)\nfig.append_trace(trace3,2,1)\nfig.append_trace(trace4,2,2)\nfig.append_trace(trace5,2,3)\nfig.append_trace(trace6,3,1)\nfig.append_trace(trace7,3,2)\nfig.append_trace(trace8,3,3)\n\nfig.update_layout(template=\"plotly_dark\",title_text='<b>Visualization before dealing Nan values</b>',font=dict(family=\"Arial,Balto,Courier new,Droid sans\",color='white'))\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Relapse and Reinfection - Recurrent TB\n\nThe results collectively illustrate that greater understanding of the differences between relapse and reinfection types of recurrent TB can provide important information for the design of more effective downstream TB control interventions.
