Methods for predicting continuous antibody epitope from protein sequences\n\nGeneral basis: Parameters such as hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, turns, exposed surface, polarity and antigenic propensity of polypeptides chains have been correlated with the location of continuous epitopes. This has led to a search for empirical rules that would allow the position of continuous epitopes to be predicted from certain features of the protein sequence. All prediction calculations are based on propensity scales for each of the 20 amino acids. Each scale consists of 20 values assigned to each of the amino acid residues on the basis of their relative propensity to possess the property described by the scale.\nGeneral method: When computing the score for a given residue i, the amino acids in an interval of the chosen length, centered around residue i, are considered. In other words, for a window size n, the i - (n-1)/2 neighboring residues on each side of residue i were used to compute the score for residue i. Unless specified, the score for residue i is the average of the scale values for these amino acids (see table 1 for specific method implementation details). In general, a window size of 5 to 7 is appropriate for finding regions that may potentially be antigenic.\n\nInterpretation of output graphs and tables: On the graphs, the Y-axes depicts for each residue the correspondent score (averaged in the specified window), be it a BepiPred score or a residue score on the Karplus and Schulz flexibility scale; while the X-axes depicts the residue positions in the sequence. The tables provide values of calculated scores for each residue. The larger score for the residues might be interpreted as that the residue might have a higher probability to be part of epitope (those residues are colored in yellow on the graphs). However, the presented methods do not predict the epitopes per se, either linear or discontinuous, -- they might only guide the researchers to further explore the protein regions on being genuine epitopes.http://tools.iedb.org/bcell/help/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRe9oro6cBfFoQvBOOyQ_BkLV00V1CgerDTIQ&usqp=CAU)slideplayer.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns #visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualization\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport cv2\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#B-Cell\n\n![](https://askabiologist.asu.edu/sites/default/files/resources/activities/body_depot/viral_attack/duck3.gif)You might think B-cells got their name because they are made inside your bones.

The residues with scores above the threshold (default value is 0.35) are predicted to be part of an epitope and colored in yellow on the graph (where Y-axes depicts residue scores and X-axes residue positions in the sequence) and marked with \"E\" in the output table. TheÊvaluesÊof the scores are not affected by the selected threshold. The table below shows the relationship between selected thresholds and the sensitivity/specificity of the prediction method, calculated on basis of the epitope/non-epitope predictions. The table is based on a large benchmark calculation containing close to 85 B cell epitopes.\n\nBepiPred-2.0: Sequential B-Cell Epitope Predictor\nReference: Jespersen MC, Peters B, Nielsen M, Marcatili P.
