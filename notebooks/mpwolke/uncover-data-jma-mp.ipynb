For those over age 60, the fatality rate jumps to 4.5 percent. The older the population, the higher the fatality rate. For those 80 and over, Covid-19 appears to have a 13.4 percent fatality rate.\n\nUnderlying conditions like diabetes and heart disease appear to be risk factors. Seventy-eight percent of all people put into intensive care for Covid-19 in the US have had an underlying condition like diabetes or heart disease: 32 percent had diabetes, 29 percent had heart disease, 21 percent had chronic lung disease, and 9 percent had compromised immune systems.  \nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/4/8/21207269/covid-19-coronavirus-risk-factors\n\nThe China Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s report of 44 000 people with laboratory confirmed covid-19. Older age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer were all associated with an increased risk of death.2 A meta-analysis of eight studies including 46 248 patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19 indicated that those with the most severe disease were more likely to have hypertension (odds ratio 2.36 (95% confidence interval 1.46 to 3.83)), respiratory disease (2.46 (1.76 to 3.44)), and cardiovascular disease (3.42 (1.88 to 6.22)).12. \n\nIn other studies, obesity and smoking were associated with increased risks.1011 In Italy, higher risks have also been reported in men than in women,13 which could be partly due to their higher smoking rates and subsequent comorbidities.\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1198"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR6ai8THI0siaak5Xa_n9E90Etq1oiA5Ah9IlArHGLvwmdPbSXK&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n%matplotlib inline\nimport missingno as msno \n\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nimport cufflinks as cf\nfrom plotly import __version__\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\n\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\nprint(__version__) #
