Evaluating muscle strength is therefore an important way to monitor disease progression in clinical trials. This is usually done in the hospital by means of a ‘hand-held dynamometer’.

Setting: Private practice clinic.\"\n\n\"The intraclass correlation coefficients for the intrarater reliability ranged from .89 to .96.

Although it appears that the relationship between HHD and isokinetic measurement is poor for the participants with tetraplegia, the variability of the isokinetic scores indicates that this observation may be a function of the method of isokinetic measurements.\"\n\n\"An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if significant differences existed for the results of each side for both rotation movements and under both test conditions (p < .05).

Currently, there are few data showing whether the left and right limbs progress at the same or different rates. That study addresses rates of decline in specific muscle groups of patients with ALS and assesses whether there is a relationship between left and right muscles in the same patient, regardless of overall progression.\"\n\n\"That report shows that linearized progression models can predict general slopes of decline with good accuracy. Critically, the data demonstrate that while overall decline is variable, there is a high degree of correlation between left and right muscle decline in ALS. This implies that irrespective of which muscle starts declining soonest or latest, their rates of decline following onset are more consistent.\"\n\n\"That study demonstrates a high degree of power when using unilateral treatment approaches to detect a slowing in disease progression in smaller groups of patients, thus allowing for paired statistical tests. These findings will be useful in transplantation trials that use muscle decline to track disease progression in ALS. Second, these findings discuss methods, such as tactical selection of muscle groups, which can improve the power efficiency of all ALS clinical trials.\" \n\nhttps://n.neurology.org/content/89/2/196"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"lkfnt\"].value_counts().plot.bar(title='Hand Held Dynamometer Left Knee fnt', color='red')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Linear modeling of individual participants.</span>**\n\n\nA large matrix of general linear models, using the same transformations as applied in linear mixed models previously, were constructed for each set of muscles including side of the body, time, and interactions for each participant.
