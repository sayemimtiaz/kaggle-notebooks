Beck, Ivona Aksentijevich\n\nScience  23 Oct 2020: Vol. 370, Issue 6515, pp. 404-405 - DOI: 10.1126/science.abe7591\n\nOne of the many pressing questions surrounding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is identifying the determinants of the clinical spectrum, from people with asymptomatic disease to patients with severe COVID-19. Up to 40% of infections may be asymptomatic, suggesting that a large proportion of people may be protected from disease. On the other end of the spectrum is severe disease, with an overall estimated fatality rate near 1%.\n\nMany studies have focused on characterizing the heterogeneity of COVID-19 in terms of demographics, with clear evidence of higher mortality in men and older individuals. \n\nThe adaptive immune system, including both B and T cells, has recently been recognized to play a critical role in providing preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2. These studies have highlighted mechanisms that protect against severe symptoms but have not revealed factors that predispose to mortality. Consequently, acquired immune responses to prior infections may account for a large percentage of the variability in disease presentation, although questions remain about additional determinants of disease, such as preexisting comorbidities.\n\nHost genetic risk factors have also emerged as a potential explanation for clinical heterogeneity and additionally offer the potential for understanding molecular pathways for tailored therapeutic intervention.\n\nSmall-scale studies have implicated the type I interferon (IFN) pathway as protective against SARS-CoV-2. The type I IFN pathway plays a crucial role in mediating innate immune responses to viral infection. Recently, multiple studies demonstrated that impaired type 1 IFN responses may be a hallmark of severe COVID-19, but why this pathway was suppressed remained unclear.\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6515/404"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://data.lustich.de/bilder/l/30323-der-schrei-der-natur.jpg)lustich.de"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Underlying medical conditions\n\nWe are learning more about COVID-19 every day.
