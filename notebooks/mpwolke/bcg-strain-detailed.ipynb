BCG strains comprise natural mutants of major virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and that BCG sub-strains differ markedly in virulence levels.\n\nThe typical features of spinal tuberculosis (TB) had been identified in Egyptian mummies dated between 3000 and 2400 BC. The first evidence of the infection in humans was found in a cemetery near Heidelberg, in the Neolithic bone remains and some scholars call TB the first disease known to mankind.\n\nIn 1882, Robert Koch discovered the disease-causing agent, known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1908, Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin, at the Institute Pasteur in Lille, isolated a virulent mycobacterium from a cow with tuberculous mastitis and attenuated the purified strain by serial passage over thirteen years on a glycerol-potato-bile medium. The Bacille de Calmette et Guérin (BCG) vaccine was first used to immunize humans in 1921.\n\nBCG became widespread after its introduction into World Health Organization (WHO) Expended Program on Immunization (EPI) in 1974.

Once safety had been\nconfirmed, BCG was disseminated between 1921 and Calmette’s death in 1933. Different laboratories maintained their own daughter strains by passaging, until the introduction of archival seed lots in the 1960s. \n\nPresent Pasteur strain was lyophilized in 1961, thus M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P corresponds to the archive established after 1,173 passages. Genomic comparisons indicate that BCG Pasteur has undergone two duplications, one SNP, and four deletions between Pasteur 1921 and 1961.\n\nThe entire genome sequences of BCG Pasteur 1173P has been published in 2007. The Pasteur strain contains two copies of DU1 which is restricted to BCG Pasteur only. There are several Countries and Institutes where they using BCG-Pasteur 1173P strains for vaccine production.\n\n#BCG Vaccine in Korea \n\nDuring the Korean War, Korean government began the national BCG vaccination project in 1952, where the vaccine was provided by Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association (JATA).\n\nIn 1953, Korean National Tuberculosis Association (KNTA) was established and BCG vaccination project expanded significantly in a more systematical way.\n\nIn 1954, Korean government dispatched Mr. Hyun-gyu Kim,the bacteriologist of National Institution of Prevention & Epidemiology (NIPE, now changed to National Institute of Health), to SSI in Copenhagen under the support of United Nations\nKorean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA). After Mr. Hyun-gyu Kim’s visit, he stopped off at Pasteur Institution his wayover\nhe brought BCG-Pasteur strain to Korea.\n\nIn 1956, research on a liquid BCG vaccine production had begun in NIPE, and the mass production of liquid BCG vaccine (20,000 mL) was initiated in 1960.

IL-6 pathways: the classic (anti-inflammatory) and the trans-signaling (pro-inflammatory). SGP130Fc could block the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway(pro-inflammatory) in COVID-19. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway activated by IL-6: Ruxolitinib and Baricitinib.\n\nIn some Covid-19 patients, disease progression leads to an enormous secretion of cytokines, known as cytokine storm, among those cytokines IL-6 plays an important role. The author shows how IL-6 has both pro and anti-inflammatory properties, depending on the pathway of transduction: soluble (trans-signaling) or membrane-related (classic signaling), and suggests how targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway, with SGP130Fc, could be a better option then targeting them both. Other possible IL-6 pathway inhibitors such as Ruxolitinib and Baricinitib are then analyzed, underlying how they lack the benefit of targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590153220300094\n\n\nInterleukin-8 Secretion from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Infected Monocytes Is Regulated by Protein Tyrosine Kinases but Not by ERK1/2 or p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases\n\nCitation:Ameixa C, Friedland JS.

It was evaluated the potential for phorbol myristate acetate-differentiated THP-1 cells to mimic this response of primary macrophages. Consistent with the behavior of alveolar macrophages, attenuated M. tuberculosis H37Ra and Mycobacterium bovis BCG strongly induce THP-1 apoptosis, which requires endogenous TNF. \n\nTHP-1 apoptosis is associated with reduced viability of infecting BCG. In contrast, virulent wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis do not increase THP-1 apoptosis over baseline. In contrast, wild-type M. bovis infection failed to activate any caspases in THP-1 cells. \n\nBCG-induced THP-1 apoptosis is blocked by retroviral transduction with vectors expressing crmA but not bcl-2.

At the National Institute of Health, the 172nd passage of BCG was freeze-dried in 1961, named BCG-Tokyo 172 strain.\n\nIn 1965, the Tokyo strain was registered as an International reference preparation of BCG vaccine by the WHO. In 1967, a multiple puncture method using a plastic cylinder was introduced to Japan, thereafter; the multiple puncture vaccination method replaced intradermal injections in Japan. The present countries using Tokyo 172 strain are Japan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and Thailand, etc https://www.ecevr.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/9995CEVR/cevr-2-83.pdf"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\n\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15, 15)\nwordcloud = WordCloud(background_color = 'white', width = 1200,  height = 1200, max_words = 100).generate(str(df[\"Unnamed: 49\"]))\nplt.imshow(wordcloud)\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.title('BCG Strain',fontsize = 20)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Gabriel Preda\n#plt.style.use('dark_background')\ndef plot_count(feature, title, df, size=1):\n    f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(4*size,4))\n    total = float(len(df))\n    g = sns.countplot(df[feature], order = df[feature].value_counts().index[:20], palette= ('#32a852', '#a84e32', '#3242a8'))\n    g.set_title(\"Number and percentage of {}\".format(title))\n    if(size > 2):\n        plt.xticks(rotation=90, size=8)\n    for p in ax.patches:\n        height = p.get_height()\n        ax.text(p.get_x()+p.get_width()/2.,\n                height + 3,\n                '{:1.2f}%'.format(100*height/total),\n                ha=\"center\") \n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_count(\"Unnamed: 49\", \"Unnamed: 49\", df,4)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Click on the bars to read column \"Unnamed: 49\".
