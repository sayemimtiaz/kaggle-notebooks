Adam Czaplinski, Albert Yen,   Stanley H. Appel, Dale J. Lange \nFirst published: 20 February 2008 https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.20977\n\n\"Progression of disease and effectiveness of therapy in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are determined by both questionnaire‐ and examination‐based measures. To determine whether both types of measurement tools are equally predictive at all stages of disease, the authors compared questionnaire‐based ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) scores to the examination‐based Appel ALS (AALS) scores at different stages of disease.\"\n\n\"Same‐day scores were obtained during 174 visits in 62 patients with definite or probable ALS. Using normalized scores, correlation between the scales and predictability were best in mildly affected patients. Predictions of ALSFRS based on AALS scores were less than half as precise in the later stages of disease. Both scales showed significant change with disease progression, but ALSFRS consistently underestimated disease severity defined by AALS (P < 0.001). Questionnaire‐based measurements should be compared against objective scales at all stages of disease severity before they are accepted as primary endpoint measures.\"\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mus.20977"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df =

Gordon, Boaz Lerner\nOctober 2019 Journal of Clinical Medicine 8(10):1578 - DOI: 10.3390/jcm8101578\n\n\"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease state prediction usually assumes linear progression and uses a classifier evaluated by its accuracy. Since disease progression is not linear, and the accuracy measurement cannot tell large from small prediction errors, the authors dispense with the linearity assumption and apply ordinal classification that accounts for error severity. In addition, they identify the most influential variables in predicting and explaining the disease.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, in contrast to conventional modeling of the patient’s total functionality, they also model separate patient functionalities (e.g., in walking or speaking). Methods: Using data from 3772 patients from the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database, they introduce and train ordinal classifiers to predict patients’ disease state in their last clinic visit, while accounting differently for different error severities.\"\n\n\"The authors used feature-selection methods and the classifiers themselves to determine the most influential variables in predicting the disease from demographic, clinical, and laboratory data collected in either the first, last, or both clinic visits, and the Bayesian network classifier to identify interrelations among these variables and their relations with the disease state. They apply these methods to model each of the patient functionalities. Results: They show the error distribution in ALS state prediction and demonstrate that ordinal classifiers outperform classifiers that do not account for error severity. They identify clinical and lab test variables influential to prediction of different ALS functionalities and their interrelations, and specific value combinations of these variables that occur more frequently in patients with severe deterioration than in patients with mild deterioration and vice versa.\"\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/336206153_Insights_into_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis_from_a_Machine_Learning_Perspective"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df = pd.get_dummies(df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Confusion matrices for each of the ALSFRS items</span>**\n\nConfusion matrices for each of the ALSFRS items when predicting disease state using only information from the first clinic visit.\n\nAuthors: Jonathan Gordon, Boaz Lerner.\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336206153/figure/fig3/AS:809368148795399@1569979812441/Confusion-matrices-for-each-of-the-ALSFRS-items-when-predicting-disease-state-using-only.png)https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Confusion-matrices-for-each-of-the-ALSFRS-items-when-predicting-disease-state-using-only_fig3_336206153"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Arun Luke Dsouza https://www.kaggle.com/arunlukedsouza/tps-apr-auto-sklearn/notebook\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder\n\ndef preprocess(df, encoder=None,\n               scaler=None, cols_to_drop=None,\n               cols_to_encode=None, cols_to_scale=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Preprocess input data\n    :param df: DataFrame with data\n    :param encoder: encoder object with fit_transform method\n    :param scaler: scaler object with fit_transform method\n    :param cols_to_drop: columns to be removed\n    :param cols_to_encode: columns to be encoded\n    :param cols_to_scale: columns to be scaled\n    :return: DataFrame\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if encoder:\n        for col in cols_to_encode:\n            df[col] = encoder.fit_transform(df[col])\n\n    if scaler:\n        for col in cols_to_scale:\n            df[col] = scaler.fit_transform(df[col].values.reshape(-1, 1))\n\n    if cols_to_drop:\n        df = df.drop(cols_to_drop, axis=1)\n\n    return df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Arun Luke Dsouza https://www.kaggle.com/arunlukedsouza/tps-apr-auto-sklearn/notebook\n\ncat_cols = ['Participant_ID', 'SubjectUID', 'Form_Name', 'Visit_Name', 'alsfdnsp', 'alsfrssp', 'sourcesp']\ncont_cols = ['alsfrs1', 'alsfrs4', 'alsfrs6', 'alsfrs7', 'alsfrs8']\n\ntrain = preprocess(df, encoder=LabelEncoder(), scaler=StandardScaler(),\n                  cols_to_drop=['alsfdn'], cols_to_encode=cat_cols,\n                  cols_to_scale=cont_cols)\n\n#test = preprocess(df, encoder=LabelEncoder(), scaler=StandardScaler(),\n #                cols_to_encode=cat_cols,\n  #               cols_to_scale=cont_cols)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Arun Luke Dsouza https://www.kaggle.com/arunlukedsouza/tps-apr-auto-sklearn/notebook\n\nimport copy\n\nX_train = df.copy()\ny_train = target.copy()\nX_test = df.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Model Definition"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/examples/40_advanced/example_metrics.html\n\nimport autosklearn.classification\ncls = autosklearn.classification.AutoSklearnClassifier(\n    time_left_for_this_task=10*60,\n    per_run_time_limit=60,\n    n_jobs=-1\n)\ncls.fit(X_train, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Much more than 4:42\n# Print the final ensemble constructed by auto-sklearn\nprint(cls.show_models())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"predictions = cls.predict(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Arun Luke Dsouza https://www.kaggle.com/arunlukedsouza/tps-apr-auto-sklearn/notebook\n\n#No need to make submisions here since there is no Submission file.\n\nsubmissions = pd.read_csv(\"../input/end-als/end-als/clinical-data/filtered-metadata/metadata/clinical/ALSFRS_R.csv\")\nsubmissions['alsfdn'] = predictions\nsubmissions.to_csv('submission_4.csv', index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\"Ordinal classification of ALS state is superior to conventional classification.
