(In 2005 \"The year of bird flu\") H5N1 avian influenza epizootics associated with sporadic human fatalities have heightened concern that a new influenza pandemic, one at least as lethal as that of 1918, could be developing.\n    \nIn early 2009, a novel pandemic H1N1 influenza virus appeared, but it has not exhibited unusually high pathogenicity. Nevertheless, because this virus spreads globally, some scientists predict that mutations will increase its lethality. Therefore, to accurately predict, plan, and respond to current and future influenza pandemics, we must first better-understand the events and experiences of 1918.\n    \nAlthough the entire genome of the 1918 influenza virus has been sequenced, many questions about the pandemic it caused remain unanswered.\n    \nIn this review, the authors discussed the origin of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, the pandemic’s unusual epidemiologic features and the causes and demographic patterns of fatality, and how this information should impact our response to the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic and future pandemics.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">In 2020 it's 103 yrs of Research!</p>\n    \nAfter 92 years of research (In 2020 it's 103 yrs of Research!), fundamental questions about influenza pandemics remain unanswered. Thus, we must remain vigilant and use the knowledge we have gained from 1918 and other influenza pandemics to direct targeted research and pandemic influenza preparedness planning, emphasizing prevention, containment, and treatment.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180813/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport cv2, glob, os\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport time\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:black; background-color:#424ef5\">\n          Questions posed by the 1918 Pandemic.\n     </h2>\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Where did the 1918 virus originate?\tAn unknown source; unlike H5N1, from an avian influenza-like lineage genetically distinct from those currently known.\n\nWhat was the pathogenesis and why did so many people die?\tDifferent pathogenesis in 1918 not documented: causes of death in 1918 similar to other pandemics; most fatalities had secondary pneumonias caused by common bacteria, ARDS-like syndromes in a minority of cases; higher proportion of severe cases at all ages seen; 1918 virus virulence determinants not yet fully mapped.\n\nWhy were there so many deaths among the young and healthy?\tUnknown; unappreciated host or environmental variables possible, such as a robust immunologic response to the virus in younger individuals resulting in enhanced tissue damage.\n\nWhy was mortality among the elderly lower than expected?\tUnknown; evidence is consistent with previous exposure to a virus eliciting protective immunity, conceivably the virus associated with the 1847 pandemic.\n\nWhy were there three pandemic waves in 1918 to 1919, and what are the implications for predicting future pandemic spread?\tUnknown; at least two virus variants in second wave; identity of viruses in first and third waves not known; epidemiology of rapidly recurrent waves not understood.\n\nDo influenza pandemics occur in predictable cycles?\tInsufficient evidence for pandemic cyclicity; steps in pandemic emergence not fully understood.\n\nAre we better able to prevent morbidity and mortality today?\tYes, in developed world with advanced medical care, antibiotics, antivirals, and effective public health; preventive vaccines would be critical if available in time, but developing world still at great risk.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180813/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading and understanding a single image\nimg = cv2.imread(\"../input/monochrome-image-dataset/Pandemics-in-History-Spanish-Flu.jpg\")\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\nplt.imshow(img, cmap = 'Pastel2'), plt.axis('off'), plt.title('Pandemics in History Spanish Flu',fontsize=20),plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Influenza Infections Symptoms</p>\n\nTypical seasonal influenza infections cause classic symptoms, such as 4 to 5 days of fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, weakness, and sometimes upper respiratory symptoms and cough.\n\nOther influenza infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild or vague symptoms.

Unlike all previous and subsequent influenza pandemics, the 1918 to 1919 pandemic seems to have spread in up to three distinct “waves” within a 9-months period.\n\nNot all influenza pandemics have had such prominent recurrences, and those that did tended to return at yearly intervals (e.g., 1889–1893), making them difficult to distinguish in kind if not in impact from normal seasonal influenza. \n\nGlobally, the first wave of the 1918 pandemic (W1), as measured by pneumonia and influenza mortality, occurred in only a few mostly Northern European countries in the summer of 1918 (as recognized in the Northern hemisphere), largely in July and August, and was associated with modest mortality. The two following waves in summer to autumn 1918 (W2) and winter 1918 to 1919 (W3) were seen in most of the world. Both were more deadly than the first wave, perhaps because of higher attack rates or higher case-fatality rates.\n\nAs noted, almost all countries experienced only one or two waves (approximately October 1918 and February–March 1919), although several other confusing patterns also were seen, including summer to autumn 1918 epidemics with very low mortality and fatal waves delayed for several years beyond 1918.\n\nThe effect of season on pandemic virus transmission is incompletely understood. Conceivably, viral, host, and environmental factors may interact in complex ways, e.g., a changing balance between aerosol vs. droplet/contact/fomite transmission during different seasons, expressed in the context of gradual virus evolution and growing population immunity.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180813/"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from PIL import Image\n\nimg = Image.open(\"../input/monochrome-image-dataset/Pandemics-in-History-Spanish-Flu.jpg\")\nimg","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Predicting Influenza Pandemics</p>\n\nLong ago, experts concluded that influenza pandemics occur in cycles, with accepted intervals varying from as long as 31 years (as articulated in 1792) to as short as 10 yrs (as articulated in 1841). After the 1889 to 1893 pandemic, interest in examining such influenza recurrence patterns was renewed but the unexpected emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has again demonstrated difficulties in prediction of cycles.\n\nBy the 1950s, cumulative historical information seemed to confirm the notions of early 18th and 19th century observers that pandemics appear in regular cycles. \n\nAt that time, this seemed to make biological sense. Before the current pandemic, the most recent pandemics (in 1889, 1918, and 1957) had apparently been caused by different viruses with novel HA genes imported from a large, naturally existing avian pool.\n\nAt approximately the same time, high population immunity seemed to pressure postpandemic viruses to drift antigenically, and surface protein-encoding genes potentially could mix with other HA and neuraminidase genes, to which humans lacked immunity. Given these facts, it was reasonable to assume that such an intimate viral–immunologic relationship would have a predictable life span.\n\nThe events of 2009 have complicated the picture even further. We now find ourselves in an era in which a direct descendant of the 1918 H1N1 virus circulates endemically, along with two of its progeny: the postpandemic 1968 H3N2 reassortant virus, which had been updated at least twice by avian influenza genes before reaching humans, and the 2009 swine-origin pandemic influenza virus, which apparently jumped from pigs to humans after “triple” reassortment-associated updating by avian, other swine, and human influenza genes. \n\nInfluenza authorities now express fading belief in pandemic cycles. There is no predictable periodicity or pattern of major influenza epidemics and … all differ from one another”. Without pandemic cycles, there can be little basis for predicting pandemic emergence.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Pandemic emergence: Three different mechanisms</p>\n\nAlthough other scenarios have been suggested, pandemic emergence can probably result from at least three very different mechanisms: de novo emergence of a unique avian-descended virus (as perhaps occurred in 1918), modification of a circulating human-adapted virus by importation via genetic reassortment of a novel HA, and adaptation to humans of nonhuman mammalian adapted viruses (2009 H1N1).\n\nThere is no reason to suppose that these three different pandemic mechanisms could produce the same cyclic intervals or that other competing adaptation mechanisms, such as reassortment with closely related HA or viral drift caused by changing population immunity induced by natural infection and increasing use of immunologically complex vaccines, could not disrupt cycles that might otherwise occur. Several “pseudopandemics” (pandemics by definition as applied to other infectious agents) have occurred by these mechanisms. Despite a large catalog of naturally occurring influenza surface protein genes theoretically capable of causing new pandemics, only three of 16 known HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two of nine neuraminidases (N1 and N2) are known to have done so in the past 120 years.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180813/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180813/bin/nihms320487f4.jpg)\n\nInfluenza pandemic occurrence, 1500 to 2009.

Pandemics are associated with abrupt and widespread epidemicity in multiple locales in two or more geographic regions, rapid progression through large open populations, high clinical illness rates affecting a broad age range, and no other pandemic activity within 5 years (to adjust for the possibility of slow and interrupted pandemic spread before the mid 19th century).\n\nEspecially before 1697, pandemics may be difficult to verify and track because of slower spread as a result of slower and less frequent human travel. Some cited sources suggest different interpretations than those presented here. The 1977 re-emergence and global spread of an “extinct” descendant of the 1918 pandemic virus is included here as a pandemic emergence, although it might also be considered to reflect continuing spread of the original pandemic virus.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180813/"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"_,axs = subplots(1,2)\nshow_image(img, ctx=axs[0], title='original')\nshow_image(img.flip_lr(), ctx=axs[1], title='flipped');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Preventing M and M in Future Pandemics</p>\n\n\nSince the 1918 pandemic, pharmaceutical advances in both antibacterial and antiviral therapy have included two classes of antiviral drugs (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) proven clinically effective against most influenza viruses. \n\nHowever, antiviral resistance has appeared fairly rapidly in both seasonal and pandemic viruses, and development of resistance during the 2009 pandemic is possible. Almost all severely ill and hospitalized patients are treated with antivirals, but the clinical effects have been modest, and their utility in reducing mortality in a pandemic is unclear.\n\nBecause studies are still ongoing to determine the optimal doses and the effect on outcome, decisions about antiviral prophylaxis or treatment need to be individualized based on a variety of factors, including the patient’s risk status for influenza illness, complications, and transmission to others at risk.\n\nThe care of severely ill patients continues to evolve. Hospital and critical care have improved greatly since 1918, but many aspects of such advanced care are controversial, including studies evaluating the treatment of systemic inflammatory response syndrome with drug interventions such as steroids and activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa), ventilator management strategies such as limited use of sedation and low tidal volumes, and other interventions such as tight glucose control and newer modes of ventilation such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The continued ongoing careful evaluation of critical care medicine techniques will likely have a further positive impact on future patients in whom severe disease develops.\n\nBecause of concern about the spread of H5N1, efforts over the past decade by both the US government and international health agencies have improved pandemic preparedness with stockpiles of antivirals, vaccines, and antibiotics, as well as increasing surge capacity of hospitals and emergency medical facilities.\n\nWe are better-prepared than we ever have been, but providing widespread access to medications and medical care, particularly in impoverished regions, is still a sobering challenge. So far, the 2009 pandemic has been neither as explosive nor as fatal as many earlier pandemics. Furthermore, the age distribution of cases, concentrated in children and young and middle-aged adults, has spared the elderly.\n\nUndoubtedly, improved standards of living and quality health care constitute the best hope for lowering global pandemic influenza deaths, especially for persons in developing regions of the world, and more so when supplemented by the development and stockpiling of broadly efficacious vaccines. \n\nTruly universal influenza vaccines based on either immunogenic antigens shared by all influenza viruses or multivalent HA and neuraminidases, both currently undergoing development, would provide broad protection. \n\nIn the meantime, multidisciplinary approaches that include preventive medicine, treatment of acute and chronic disease, and good public health measures remain important components of any pandemic preparedness strategy. Furthermore, efforts must be directed toward prevention based on improved understanding of pandemic risks, increased surveillance, development of countermeasures, logistic planning, and an aggressive and broad research agenda. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180813/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#That paper is from 2010.
