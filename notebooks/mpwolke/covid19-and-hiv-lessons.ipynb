SARS-CoV-2 has certainly cracked ours. Think of this virus as an intelligent biological machine continuously running DNA experiments to adapt to the ecological niche it inhabits. This virus has caused a pandemic in large part because it acted on three of our most human vulnerabilities.\n\n#Human issues: Our biological defenses, our clustering patterns of social behavior and our simmering political divides.\n\nSeveral lessons from the long battle with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, suggest what may lie ahead. HIV/AIDS is one of the worst scourges humans have encountered. As a code cracker, HIV is an expert. By the end of 2019 the global death toll from this virus was roughly 33 million people. In all, 76 million people have been infected, and scientists estimate another 1.7 million people acquire the virus every year.\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lessons-from-aids-for-the-covid-19-pandemic/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/covid_hiv_cover_960_0.jpg)unaids.org"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Just as with AIDS and cancer, we will need a combination of medicines to treat this disease\n\nOf the nearly 38 million people currently living with HIV/AIDS, 25 million are receiving full antiretroviral treatments that prevent disease and suppress the virus so well they are unlikely to pass it along. I would wager that another 25 million or more infections never happened, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, because these treatments became available in most countries.\n\nFrom fighting this epic war against AIDS, doctors, virologists, epidemiologists and public health experts have learned crucial lessons that we can apply to the battle we are currently waging. For instance, we saw that vaccines are never a guarantee but that treatments can be our most important weapon. We discovered that human behavior plays a vital role in any disease-fighting effort and that we cannot overlook human nature. We have also seen how critical it is to build on knowledge and tools gained fighting earlier outbreaks—a strategy only possible if we continue funding research in between pandemics.\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lessons-from-aids-for-the-covid-19-pandemic/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadssurveillancecsv/surveillance.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'surveillance.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSLd7XlU6z9ornp1KchLi5__B0vc9rMbGfZhw&usqp=CAU)msfaccess.org"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Columns Names\n\n\"tbhiv_sentin_cil\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Lower limit (95% confidence interval) of prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using sentinel sites\"\n\n\"tbhiv_sentin_ciu\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Upper limit (95% confidence interval) of prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using sentinel sites\"\n\n\"tbhiv_sentin_prev\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using sentinel sites\"\n\n\"tbhiv_sentin_yr\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Year in which prevalence of HIV in TB patients was estimated using sentinel sites\"\n\n\"tbhiv_surv_cil\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Lower limit (95% confidence interval) of prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using nationwide representative surveys\"\n\n\"tbhiv_surv_ciu\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Upper limit (95% confidence interval) of prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using nationwide representative surveys\"\n\n\"tbhiv_surv_prev\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Prevalence (%) of HIV in TB patients estimated using nationwide representative surveys\"\n\n\"tbhiv_surv_yr\",\"Non-routine HIV surveillance\",,\"Year in which prevalence of HIV in TB patients was estimated using nationwide representative surveys\" https://gitlab.procc.fiocruz.br/oswaldo/DS_2017/blob/4e8f97ebbd15bdba60c2e3c0d91298a24801a2c5/exemplos/TB_data_dictionary_2017-10-23.csv"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#VACCINE CHALLENGES\n\nUnlike the hit-and-run polio virus, which evokes long-term immunity after an infection, HIV is a “catch it and keep it” virus—if you are infected, the pathogen stays in your body until it destroys the immune system, leaving you undefended against even mild infections. Moreover, HIV continually evolves a shrewd opponent seeking ways to elude our immune responses. Although this does not mean a vaccine is impossible, it certainly meant developing one, especially when the virus hit in the 1980s, would not be easy. “Unfortunately, no one can predict with certainty that an AIDS vaccine can ever be made,” “That is not to say it is impossible to make such a vaccine, only that we are not certain of success.” More than 30 years later there still is no effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection.\n\n#Covid-19 reinfection by the same Strain? Transient immune protection? \n\nFrom what we have seen of SARS-CoV-2, it interacts with our immune system in complex ways, resembling polio in some of its behavior and HIV in others. We know from nearly 60 years of observing coronaviruses that a body's immune system can clear them. That seems to be generally the case for SARS-CoV-2 as well. But the cold-causing coronaviruses, just like HIV, also have their tricks. Infection from one of them never seems to confer immunity to reinfection or symptoms by the same strain of virus—that is why the same cold viruses return each season. \n\nThese coronaviruses are not a hit-and-run virus like polio or a catch-it-and-keep-it virus like HIV. I call them “get it and forget it” viruses—once cleared, your body tends to forget it ever fought this foe. Early studies with SARS-CoV-2 suggest it might behave much like its cousins, raising transient immune protection.\n\nThe path to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may be filled with obstacles. Whereas some people with COVID-19 make neutralizing antibodies that can clear the virus, not everybody does. Whether a vaccine will stimulate such antibodies in everyone is still unknown. Moreover, we do not know how long those antibodies can protect someone from infection. It may be two or three years before we will have the data to tell us and any confidence in the outcome.\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lessons-from-aids-for-the-covid-19-pandemic/"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# categorical features with missing values\ncategorical_nan = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].isna().sum()>0 and df[feature].dtypes=='O']\nprint(categorical_nan)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Vaccines Success: Will it work? Will it be safe? Will it be long lasting?\n\nAnother challenge is how this virus enters the body: through the nasal mucosal membranes. No COVID-19 vaccine currently in development has shown an ability to prevent infection through the nose. In nonhuman primates, some vaccines can prevent the disease from spreading efficiently to the lungs. But those studies do not tell us much about how the same drug will work in humans; the disease in our species is very different from what it is in monkeys, which do not become noticeably ill.\n\nWe learned with HIV that attempts to prevent virus entry altogether do not work well—not for HIV and not for many other viruses, including influenza and even polio. Vaccines act more like fire alarms: rather than preventing fires from breaking out, they call the immune system for help once a fire has ignited.\n\nThe hopes of the world rest on a COVID-19 vaccine. It seems likely that scientists will announce a “success” sometime this year, but success is not as simple as it sounds. As I write, officials in Russia have reported approving a COVID-19 vaccine. Will it work? Will it be safe? Will it be long lasting? No one will be able to provide convincing answers to these questions for any forthcoming vaccine soon, perhaps not for at least several years.\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lessons-from-aids-for-the-covid-19-pandemic/"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# replacing missing values in categorical features\nfor feature in categorical_nan:\n    df[feature] = df[feature].fillna('None')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[categorical_nan].isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#FOCUS ON TREATMENTS - Resistance to Single Drugs\n\n\"Thirty thousand volunteers around the world participate in networks built by the National Institutes of Health for studies of new HIV vaccine candidates, and these networks are being tapped for initial testing of COVID-19 vaccines, too.\"\n\n\"The gold standard for AIDS treatment now is called antiretroviral therapy—essentially patients take a cocktail of at least three different drugs that attack the HIV virus in different ways.

It is part of what is driving people out of their homes and into bars and parties. Anyone with a craving for a beer can quench their thirst in the safety of their own home, but gratification comes less easily for other desires, especially when one is young, single and living alone. Our public health strategies should not ignore this fact.\n\nThe same lessons we learned in the midst of the HIV epidemic to help young people change their behaviors apply today to COVID-19: know your risk, know your partners and take necessary precautions. Many young people operate under the false assumption that even if they become infected, they will not become severely ill. Not only is this belief untrue, but even people with asymptomatic infections can suffer serious, lasting damage. But the more people understand the risk (younger people especially) the greater likelihood they will take the steps necessary to protect themselves and others.
