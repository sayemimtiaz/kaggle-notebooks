Duke University anticipated that the FDA could move quickly so they are preparing for an expected early shipment of the Pfizer vaccine to Duke, along with final guidance from the FDA, later this month.\n\nBased on guidelines developed by the state, Duke healthcare workers who are most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-2) in the course of fulfilling their job responsibilities will be among the first group eligible to receive a vaccine. This includes employees in both clinical and research areas. It is important to note that:\n\nEligible faculty and staff in clinical and research areas will be contacted in the coming weeks with additional information \n    \nInitial supplies will be limited.\n    \nCurrently, there are no plans to require COVID-19 vaccination.\n    \nThe vaccine will be provided at no cost.   \nhttps://today.duke.edu/2020/12/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-information-duke-community    "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Codes by Shrushrita Sharma\n     </h2>\n\n\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/shrushritasharma/understanding-basic-image-operations/comments"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing essential libraries\nimport cv2, glob, os\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom PIL import Image","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing essential datasets\nBASE = '../input/cusersmarildownloads23660jpeg/'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Most frequently questions during the FDA review process:\n     </h2>\n\nThe initial safety and efficacy data released by Pfizer for this first vaccine are very promising. Unlike traditional vaccines that use inactive parts of the virus to trigger the immune system, the Pfizer vaccine uses messenger RNA, or mRNA, to produce protective antibodies.\n    \nWhile this type of vaccine is new and will represent a medical breakthrough if authorized for emergency use, the approach of using mRNA to trigger the immune system has already been shown to be safe and effective in peer-reviewed medical research.\n    \nThe Pfizer vaccine requires ultra-cold storage and precise handling, and Duke University is fortunate to have the equipment and expertise to administer it safely and effectively.\n    \nThe vaccine will initially be available at Duke University Hospital, Duke Regional Hospital and Duke Raleigh Hospital, as well as through county health departments. In later months, as the vaccine becomes more widely available, they expect to expand to additional vaccination sites in the Duke system.\n    \nThe Pfizer vaccine requires two doses administered three weeks apart to be effective.\n    \nAfter receiving each dose of the vaccination, team members will need to wait under observation for a short period of time. Some individuals will experience side effects, similar to most of our current vaccines.\n    \nRegardless of their vaccination status, they will all need to be vigilant about wearing masks, observing physical distancing and washing hands until the pandemic subsides. They are still months away from vaccines being available widely to their community.\n    \nOver time, the more people who are vaccinated, the less likely it is that any of us will develop COVID-19 disease.

By Niall McCarthy - Dec 1, 2020 \n    \nThe research shows that the U.S. had secured 1.01 billion doses from six different companies up to November 20 which represents the highest quantity of any government apart from India which has made agreements for 1.6 billion.   \n    \nPfizer/BioNTech and Moderna both account for 100 million U.S. doses each while the U.S. is also set for 500 million doses of the vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. It offers 70 percent protection according to trials, though it is believed this can be increased to 90 percent by tweaking the dose. \n    \nThe rest of the U.S. supply is made up of candidates that have not reported detailed testing results and it includes vaccines developed by Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and Sanofi-GSK.\n    \nModerna has reported some more good news from its trials, stating that its Covid-19 vaccine candidate has a final efficacy of just over 94 percent with nobody who received it during trials falling severely ill. That has paved the way for the company to apply for emergency usage authorization in the U.S. and Europe. That puts Moderna around a week behind Pfizer and BioNTech who already took that step with their own vaccine that emerged from trials with an efficacy of 95 percent.\n    \nWith the pandemic worsening and the race to roll out the first vaccine heating up, governments around the world have already reserved close to 10 billion doses before a single candidate has even reached the market. 2.6 billion further doses are under negotiation or reserved as optional expansions of existing deals. The findings come from Duke University who have been aggregating and analyzing publicly available data on vaccine procurement and manufacturing.  \nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/23660/umber-of-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-secured-by-the-us/\n    \n    "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading the image\n\nimage_01 = cv2.imread(BASE+'23660.jpeg')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Visualizing the image histogram for first image\ncounts,bins,_ = plt.hist(image_01.ravel(),density = False, alpha = 0.8, histtype = 'stepfilled', color = 'BurlyWood', edgecolor = 'Brown')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          When will the general public have access to a COVID-19 vaccine?\n     </h2>\n\nBy Josh Chapin - Wednesday, November 25, 2020  \n    \n\nAn infectious diseases doctor at Duke University Hospital is thrilled with some of the results coming in about a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna have reported that they should have enough efficacy and safety data to apply for an Emergency Use Authorization by the end of November.\n\n\"The flu vaccine efficacy is very dependent on what the strains are circulating at any given time so to hit a 90% in a flu vaccine would be a banner year,\" \n\nSome have shown to have a 95% efficacy which is much more than was expected.

Therefore, it is important that flexibility is implemented and realistic expectations by federal officials on initial supply are set forth.\n\nAnother major issue with current vaccines is that several of them must be preserved at extremely cold temperatures, which requires specialized equipment not readily available at many sites.\n\nBut one solution to combat this issue is to implement a distribution approach that involves distributed networks of federally managed cold chain sites and use of mass vaccination to reach target populations, KFF stated.\n    \n\n    \n#Two-doses for immunization - Careful tracking of doses and follow-up with each individual \n    \n    \nCurrently, many of the leading vaccine candidates require two-doses for immunization and will require careful tracking of doses and follow-up with each individual. But this presents its own set of challenges.\n\nTo address this issue, the CDC and local jurisdictions are currently in the process of implementing a new vaccine tracking system to monitor COVID-19 vaccine administration and help with multiple dose tracking.\n\nFinally, vaccines may be released on an accelerated schedule and some may be administered under an emergency use authorization without having gone through a full safety review initially. \n\nTherefore, the government is planning on implementing enhanced safety monitoring to track vaccine adverse events, researchers noted. This will ensure the safety of the vaccines and establish evidence of any adverse events in the months following administration. \n\nThe pandemic has had devastating health and economic impact and disproportionate impact in some communities, particularly communities of color.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">49% of Black Americans would NOT GET a COVID-19 vaccine</p>\n    \n    \nA KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) report released last week found that 49 percent of Black Americans would not get a COVID-19 vaccine even if it was determined safe and effective. \n\nBut one simple way to combat this issue is effective outreach strategies developed in partnership with and directed toward black communities. This will be critical to building public trust and willingness to get vaccinated, researchers stated.\n\nCommunication and trust of all Americans are also major issues in the current pandemic, specifically regarding a COVID-19 vaccine.\nhttps://pharmanewsintel.com/news/overcoming-the-top-challenges-of-covid-19-vaccine-distribution"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Gaussian filtering the images\nplt.figure(figsize=(20,10))\nplt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(cv2.GaussianBlur(image_01,(5,5),0), cmap = 'hsv'), plt.axis('off'), plt.title('Covid-19 Vaccines',fontsize=30)\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Safety and Efficacy of the Vaccine.\n     </h2>\n\nNearly half (51 percent) of Americans said they would definitely or probably get a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available today, a September KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) report found.
