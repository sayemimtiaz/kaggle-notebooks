So I'm still a beginner in the Data Science field, if you have any recommendations or suggestions please put them in the comments down below! Thanks :D \n\nToday in our analysis we will look at the \"Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016\" dataset. This dataset contains 12 features: \n- country: The country of residence of the individual\n- year: The year the suicide happend \n- sex: The gender of the individual (male/female)\n- age group: The age group of the individual \n- count of suicides: The count number of suicides that happend \n- population: The overall population of the country \n- suicide rate: The number of suicides per 100,000 person\n- country-year composite key: A code containing the country name plus the year of the suicide \n- HDI for year: Human Development Index is a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators.\n- gdpforyear: The GDP of the country at that year\n- gdppercapita: The GDP per capita of the country at that year\n- generation: The name of the corresponding generation \n\nDuring this analysis, we will first clean our data and make the needed transformation(We will keep transforming our data whenever it's needed during the analysis). Second, we will perform an exploratory data analysis where we will try to extract a few usefull insights from our dataset. Finally we will try to predict the number of suicides given the features we have. \n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a4c78412b69220001d82c7d/5a4c78412b69220001d82dc2_171128_cropped_tsis-lowres.jpg)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Preprocessing:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing needed packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns \nsns.set()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- First, we'll start by importing our data.
