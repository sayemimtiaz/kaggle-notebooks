Employees of the department transfer the technology to the industry by different mechanisms including project deliverables, dissertations, technology licencing, and spin-off companies (see figure below). In this notebook I cast some light on on the last two mechanisms - licensing and spin-offs. These tech transfer mechanisms are normally collaboration projects of the department and [TTO](https://www.ntnutto.no/home/) (Technology Transfer Office NTNU). The major role of TTO is to facilitate the projects including, among others, business development and evaluation of project ideas received from NTNU's employees. This notebook shows some statistics and simple analysis of the innovative project ideas that has been submitted to TTO in the last 14 years - between 2006 and 2019. It is based on a dataset provided by courtesy of TTO in December 2019 and supplied by additional information by the author of the notebook."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nImage(\"../input/images/chart_tt.png\", width=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport squarify\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\nfrom pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters\nregister_matplotlib_converters()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Path of the file to read\nfilepath = \"../input/innovat/tto_public_comma.csv\"\n\n# Read the file into a variable\ndata = pd.read_csv(filepath)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset\nThe dataset consists of some details of the ideas submitted to TTO by the employees.
