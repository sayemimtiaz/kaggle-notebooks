From these human proteins, the were able to \"identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical\ncompounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays.\"\n\nThis approach looks specifically at SARS-CoV proteins, their interaction partners, and the compounds that have been shown to inhibit them. The massive amount of research material contained in Kaggle's CORD-19 research challenge contains published papers of both SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as well as SARS-CoV (SARS), making it a major resource to discover new inhibitors or drugs. Because the current outbreak of the virus SARS-CoV-2 has high biochemical similarity to SARS-CoV, we believe this literature dataset likely contains a significant amount of information about protein-protein interactions as well as protein-inhibitor interactions that relate to these viruses. \n\nOur process will go as follows:\n1. Parse through abstract excerpts to collect a subset of papers that mention proteins in either SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV.\n2.

To date, potential antiviral treatments for MERS-CoV have shown limited efficacy in animal studies. Here, we tested the efficacy of the broad-acting antiviral remdesivir in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection. Remdesivir reduced the severity of disease, virus replication, and damage to the lungs when administered either before or after animals were infected with MERS-CoV. Our data show that remdesivir is a promising antiviral treatment against MERS that could be considered for implementation in clinical trials. It may also have utility for related coronaviruses such as the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emerging from Wuhan, China.\", \n              \"The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), for which there is no vaccine or any known effective treatment created a sense of urgency for novel drug discovery approaches. One of the most important COVID-19 protein targets is the 3C-like protease for which the crystal structure is known. Most of the immediate efforts are focused on drug repurposing of known clinically-approved drugs and virtual screening for the molecules available from chemical libraries that may not work well. For example, the IC50 of lopinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, against the 3C-like protease is approximately 50 micromolar, which is far from ideal. In an attempt to address this challenge, on January 28th, 2020 Insilico Medicine decided to utilize a part of its generative chemistry pipeline to design novel drug-like inhibitors of COVID-19 and started generation on January 30th. It utilized three of its previously validated generative chemistry approaches: crystal-derived pocked-based generator, homology modelling-based generation, and ligand-based generation. Novel druglike compounds generated using these approaches were published at www.insilico.com/ncov-sprint/. Several molecules will be synthesized and tested using the internal resources; however, the team is seeking collaborations to synthesize, test, and, if needed, optimize the published molecules\"]},index=[1,2])\ndata_df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#how to index a specific row in \ndata_df.abstract[2]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here, we move into Natural Language Processing to analyze the words in the abstract data frame.

= [\"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), continues to cause severe respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate. To date, potential antiviral treatments for MERS-CoV have shown limited efficacy in animal studies. Here, we tested the efficacy of the broad-acting antiviral remdesivir in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection. Remdesivir reduced the severity of disease, virus replication, and damage to the lungs when administered either before or after animals were infected with MERS-CoV. Our data show that remdesivir is a promising antiviral treatment against MERS that could be considered for implementation in clinical trials. It may also have utility for related coronaviruses such as the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emerging from Wuhan, China.\"]\nwords = set(nltk.corpus.words.words())\nnew = \" \".join(w for w in nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(test) if w.lower() in words or not w.isalpha())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(stopwords.words('english'))\nprint(all_stopwords)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"word_tokens = word_tokenize(abstract) \n  \nfiltered_sentence = [w for w in word_tokens if not w in all_stopwords] \n  \nfiltered_sentence = [] \n  \nfor w in word_tokens: \n    if w not in all_stopwords: \n        filtered_sentence.append(w) \n  \nprint(word_tokens) \nprint(filtered_sentence)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ID","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"len(token)\nprint(abstract)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
