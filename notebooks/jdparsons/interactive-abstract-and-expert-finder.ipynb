Methodology\n \n 1. **Load data**\n   * Remove duplicate publications\n   * For each row of data, combine the Title and Abstract into the \"document\" that is used for all further processing and analysis.\n 2. **Clean text** - the goal is to simplify the text as much as possible. This means removing things that seem useful to us humans, like numbers, verb conjugations, and special characters, but that don't provide much signal to the machine\n   * Replace newlines with spaces\n     * except if a newline is preceded by a hyphen, which indicates that a long word was broken by a line break\n   * Remove non-ASCII characters\n   * Remove numbers\n   * Remove known character patterns that provide no value. Ex: \"[Image: see text]\"\n   * Lemmatize words - reduces all conjugations and pluralizations down to a single word. This reduces the total number of unique words the machine has to process while preserving the essence of the word's meaning \n     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation\n   * Remove stopwords\n     * Remove common English stopwords like \"and\", \"it\", \"the\" and many others\n     * Remove any custom stopwords that don't contribute useful signal\n   * Create ngrams\n     * When 2 tokens frequently appear side-by-side, treat them as the same token.\n     * Example \"public health\" should be treated as a single token. Replace both words with the single token of \"public_health\". The words \"public\" and \"health\" still appear as single tokens, but not when they occur directly next to each other.\n     * When 2 token are joined, that's called a \"bigram\". When 3 tokens are joined, that's called a \"trigram\". In this notebook, I only do bigrams and trigrams, but you could continue joining n number of tokens, which is generally called an \"ngram\".\n   * Dedupe sentences within each document\n     * Just in case the Title is the same as the opening line of the Abstract, dedupe and drop any later sentences that have already appeared.\n     * After all the cleanup above, some sentences may now appear as identical sets of tokens, which implies they don't contribute any additional valuable signal.\n   * Remove extremely rare words and extremely common words\n     * The machine needs many example of how words are used before it can \"understand\" what a word means. For this reason, we must remove words that do not appear very frequently across all documents.\n     * Conversely, words like \"virus\" or \"infection\" appear in a third of all documents, so the machine would treat those words as unhelpful noise. Remove these common words, which leaves us only with \"interesting\" words that help differentiate the documents from one another.\n   * Example of the final processing:\n     * Original text: *\"Cruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing. On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25 January. By 4 February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented.\"*\n     * Result seen by the machine: *['cruise', 'ship', 'carry', 'large_number', 'people', 'confine', 'space', 'relative', 'homogeneous', 'mix', 'february', 'outbreak', 'covid', 'cruise', 'ship', 'report', 'initial', 'case', 'follow', 'index', 'case', 'board', 'around', 'january', 'february', 'public_health', 'measure', 'removal', 'isolation', 'ill', 'passenger', 'quarantine', 'passenger', 'implement']*\n 3. **Use CorEx to assign topic-liklihood scores to each document**\n   * This allows us to filter search results that somehow have a strong cosine distance score, but that are not relevant to the topic of the question.\n 4. **Train TF-IDF model**\n   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf\n   * I first attempted to train a Doc2Vec model, but the results were weak. Perhaps there wasn't enough training data. I am curious if anyone knows of a finetuned BERT (or other model) based on medical literature?\n   * Once the model is trained, we can convert a document into a numerical vector. This allows us to use cosine distance to measure the similarity between documents.\n   * Any other form of vectorizing text could be used here. If you had success training a Doc2Vec model, or some other model, I'd love to hear about it in the comments!\n 5. **Interactive widget to explore the results**\n \n \n A big thank you to the following resources:\n\n * https://www.kaggle.com/morrisb/ipython-magic-functions\n * https://www.kaggle.com/gkaraman/topic-modeling-lda-on-cord-19-paper-abstracts\n * https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/lemmatization-examples-python/\n * https://towardsdatascience.com/make-your-own-super-pandas-using-multiproc-1c04f41944a1\n * https://www.kaggle.com/dgunning/browsing-research-papers-with-a-bm25-search-engine"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

Drag the topic_threshold slider to filter out results that don't strongly align to the topic.\n   * Interestingly, if you lower the threshold slider all the way to -20, with the default query of \"cruise ship spread rate\", the top result is not what you'd expect. Apparently, there's an all-caps acronym SHIP that stands for something not boat related. This is why the CorEx topic thresholds can be useful to filter out these unexpectedly good TF-IDF matches.\n\nHere are a few of the Kaggle-provided questions:\n\n* What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?
