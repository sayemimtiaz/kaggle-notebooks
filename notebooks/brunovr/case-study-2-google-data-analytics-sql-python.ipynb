Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Oﬃcer of **Bellabeat**, believes that analyzing smart device ﬁtness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.\n\n## The task\n\nAnalyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. These insights will help guide marketing strategy for the company.\n\n## About the company\n \nUrška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.\nSršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around\nthe world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with\nknowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly\npositioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\nBy 2016, Bellabeat had opened oﬃces around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available\nthrough a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their [website](https://bellabeat.com/). The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.\n\nSršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat's available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has\nasked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain\ninsight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level\nrecommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n\n# The report\n\nThe insights will be presented following the data analysis process steps:\n\n* 🤔**Ask**: Identify the problem to be solved and how our insights can drive business decisions.\n* 💻**Prepare**: Gather the relevant data, organize it and store it. Verify data integrity and credibility.\n* 🧰**Process**: Choose tools to handle the data and identify its advantages. Clean our data and ensure it is ready for analysis. Document the cleaning process and save cleaned data.\n* 🧑🏻‍💻**Analyze**: Organize and format the data to answer our questions. Perform calculations and identify trends and relationships within the data.\n* 📊**Share**: Create visualizations to share most relevant findings. Relate findings to original questions.\n* 🎬**Act**: present final conclusions and suggested approach to deal with findings and next steps.\n\n---\n\n# 🤔**Ask**:\n\n## The business task\n\nAnalyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices.

reminder, we phrased our question as\n> **How current user trends can guide marketing strategy?**\n\n---\n\nBefore we start *telling our story with the data*, let's set the color palette for our graphs to match that of the company logo (as seen to the left). We can easily do this with Seaborn's `set_pallete()` method. To improve readability, we will also increase overall font sizes with the `set_context()` method.\n\nWe'll start our sharing with some basic descriptions.

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0324-daily-step-count.html):\n    > ...higher daily step counts were associated with lower mortality risk from all causes.\n\n    If our product can output the number of steps in real time, we can **motivate users to reach a certain number of steps daily**! Once again, the CDC informs us that\n    \n    > ...compared with taking 4,000 steps per day, a number considered to be low for adults, taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps.\n* If the goal is to burn some calories, there is a **linear relation between steps taken and calories burned**. Our step monitor could use user data to fit a model and predict how many steps a user should take to reach a certain amount of calories burned. Further investigation into the *MET* data could be very useful to this.\n* Regarding sleeping habits, there was a clear decrease of sedentary minutes as the number of minutes asleep increased. So, another goal of the product could be to motivate users to keep a consistent and sufficient sleeping schedule. Going back to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0324-daily-step-count.html):\n    > Being physically active has many benefits, including reducing a person’s risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.
