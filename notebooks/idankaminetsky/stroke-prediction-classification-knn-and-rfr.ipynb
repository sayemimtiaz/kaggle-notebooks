Task definition and general information </ins> \n\n## Classificastion task - Predict Stroke\nOur top priority in this health problem is to identify patients with a stroke. Therefore, we would like to identify any observation that may be a stroke.<br>\nThe data represents the population that comes to the emergency room with some suspicion of stroke. About 1/20 of them actually have a stroke. The aim of the model is to identify as many as possible of those who actually have a stroke and at the same time increase as much as possible the 1 \\ X ratio between those who have a stroke and those who do not have a stroke (20> X as much as possible) of all people who identify the model as having a stroke.<br>\nI chose this data and this task out of a personal touch on the matter. As an MDA medic, I think that already during the initial treatment, with the help of the ML model, the patient's problem can be better established.\nIn addition, the model will be able to provide a quick response to physicians and thus save time, reduce the amount of people with a reasonable suspicion of stroke and treat stroke cases more quickly."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## general knowledge:\n\nA stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths, accounting for 6.2 million deaths. Approximately 17 million people had a stroke in 2010 and 33 million people have previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world.\n\nThe main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation.\n\n(source - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke)\n\nHigh blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and diabetes are leading causes of stroke. 1 in 3 US adults has at least one of these conditions or habits.

confusion matrix\nA confusion matrix gives a useful information about how well the model does. However, its elements can be used to calculate many performance metrics to get even more information. Among the most popular:\n\n1. Accuracy is the most intuitive performance measure, and defined as the ratio of the number of correctly classified objects to the total number of objects evaluated.\n\n2. Precision it is simply a ratio of correctly predicted positive data objects to the total predicted positive data objects.\n\n3. Recall it is defined by the number of correct positive results divided by the total number of relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive).\n\n4. F-score it can be defined as a weighted average of the precision and recall. An F-score is considered perfect when reaches its best value at 1, while the model is a total failure when it reaches the 0 value.\n\n5. The F-beta-score is a generalization of the F-score that adds a configuration parameter called beta. A default beta value is 1.0, which is the same as the F-score. A smaller beta value, such as 0.5, gives more weight to precision and less to recall, whereas a larger beta value, such as 2.0, gives less weight to precision and more weight to recall in the calculation of the score.\n\n(source - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-019-1356-9)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are few options for performence measure.

Therefore, we will use F beta when beta = 4. Supposedly, re-call is 4 times more important than precision.\n\n$$ Fbeta(4) = \\frac{(1+4^2) X precision X recall}{(4^2) X precision+recall} $$\n\nAccuracy will not be appropriate for 2 reasons: a. It is impossible to make sure that we predict all the strokes cases. B. If we define the zero model according to the division of yes/no stroke in the data or if we define that it will always say that there is no stroke - it will succeed in about 95% of the cases (because of the distribution of targets attribute). 95% is a false accuracy that will be very difficult to circumvent.\nF-SCORE will not fit because the recall and percision not equal in weight in this task."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <ins> F.
