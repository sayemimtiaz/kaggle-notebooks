This gave us a good start point for improving the already well-working Question Answering tool for the COVID challenge.\n\nIn addition, credit for setting up the Anserini + BERT framework goes to [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/), Edwin Zhang, and Nikhil Gupta at the University of Waterloo.\nThanks also to [Wonjin Yoon et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08229) for creating and proving the pre-trained BIOASQ model. \n\n## Findings & Results\n\n * In general, the Question Answering results differ only slightly. It is hard for non-experts to determine which results answer a question more accurately. The resulting abstractive summary can be used to see the slight differences on a quick glance.\n * The exact same answer (including span section) is often returned. The resulting confidence is then also the same, as this confidence is computed in both cases using the Universal Sentence Encoder.\n * In other cases, either a complete new result is returned or a result where only the span sections differ. These cases are the ones where the BioASQ model answered a question differently than the BERT-SQuAD. \n\n\n### Example Query - How long is the incubation period for the virus?\n\n#### BioASQ Abstractive Summary: \nThe incubation period for covid-19 is between 2-10 days, according to the world health organization. to avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are
