Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\nThe objective of this dataset is to predict whether a patient has or not diabetes, so this is a **supervised binary classification** problem.\n\nI also report here some additional information about the topic of our analysis, Diabetes, that I found at the following link: https://www.idf.org/aboutdiabetes/what-is-diabetes.html.\n\n#### What is Diabetes?\n\n> Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces.\nInsulin is a hormone made by the pancreas, that acts like a key to let glucose from the food we eat pass from the blood stream into the cells in the body to produce energy. All carbohydrate foods are broken down into glucose in the blood. Insulin helps glucose get into the cells. \nNot being able to produce insulin or use it effectively leads to raised glucose levels in the blood (known as hyperglycaemia). Over the long-term high glucose levels are associated with damage to the body and failure of various organs and tissues."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.1 Features description"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In our dataset, each patient is described by the following 9 features:\n\n- **Pregnancies**: number of times pregnant.\n- **Glucose**: plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.\n- **BloodPressure**: diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).\n- **SkinThickness** triceps skin fold thickness (mm).\n- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).\n- **BMI**: body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).\n- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: diabetes pedigree function.\n- **Age**: age (years).\n- **Diabetes**: class variable (1:diabetes, 0:no diabetes).

Classification](#4.-Classification), in order to estimate the best set of hyperparameters for each classifier I will use Cross-Validation. <br> \nPerforming Cross-Validation using the oversampled training set would result in biased outcomes of the algorithm, because the folds used for validation would contain synthetic samples generated by the oversampling of the original samples contained in the folds used for training, resulting in a leakage of information. <br>\nThe correct way of applying SMOTE using Cross-Validation, as we will see later, is to create a Pipeline so that the oversampling is performed only after the split and esclusively on the folds used for training. So, the oversampled training set that I am going to generate in this section, will never be used in the next chapters._\n\nLet's check what are the effects of applying SMOTE on the training data:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n\nsmote = SMOTE( random_state=RANDOM_STATE_SEED )\nX_train_smote, y_train_smote = smote.fit_resample( X_train_normalized, y_train )\n\ndf_X_train_smote = pd.DataFrame( X_train_smote, columns=cols[ 0:8 ] )\ndf_y_train_smote = pd.DataFrame( y_train_smote, columns = [ cols[ 8 ] ] )\ndf_train_smote = df_X_train_smote.join( df_y_train_smote )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see how many samples belong to the two classes after the oversampling performed by SMOTE:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"num_diabetes_smote = df_train_smote[ \"Diabetes\" ].sum()\nnum_no_diabetes_smote = df_train_smote.shape[ 0 ] - num_diabetes_smote\nperc_diabetes_smote = num_diabetes_smote / df_train_smote.shape[ 0 ] * 100\nperc_no_diabetes_smote = num_no_diabetes_smote / df_train_smote.shape[ 0 ] * 100\n\nprint( \"There are %d (%.2f%%) people with diabetes and %d (%.2f%%) people without diabetes.\" % ( num_diabetes_smote, perc_diabetes_smote, num_no_diabetes_smote, perc_no_diabetes_smote ) )\n\ndef plot_diabetes_value_counts( normalize ):\n    plt.grid( False )\n    df_train_smote[ 'Diabetes' ].value_counts( normalize=normalize ).plot( kind=\"bar\", grid=False, color=[ sns.color_palette()[ 0 ], sns.colors.xkcd_rgb.get( 'dusty orange' ) ] )\n    plt.xticks( [ 0, 1 ], [ 'No', 'Yes' ], rotation=0 )\n    plt.xlabel( \"Diabetes\" )\n    \n    if ( normalize == False ):\n        plt.ylabel( \"Count\" )\n    else:\n        plt.ylabel( \"Percentage\" )    \n        \n    return\n    \nplt.subplot( 1, 2, 1 )\nplot_diabetes_value_counts( False )\nplt.subplot( 1, 2, 2 )\nplot_diabetes_value_counts( True )\nplt.tight_layout( True )\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As expected, the classes are now balanced."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4. Classification"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this part, I will try several classifiers in order to evaluate which of them performs the best with our dataset.\n\nI chose the following classifiers:\n- **k-Nearest Neighbors**\n- **Linear Discriminant Analysis**\n- **Support Vector Machine**\n- **Decision Tree**\n- **Random Forest**\n\nFor each classifier I will fit three different models: one using the original dataset, one using the dataset balanced by SMOTE and one using the dataset reduced with PCA.\n\nIn order to properly select the hyperparameters for each classifier I will use a **GridSearch 5-fold Cross-Validation** approach, which allows to estimate which are the hyperparameters that give the best generalized results in a more reliable way than just trying several hyperparameters' configurations using only the training set and a validation set.\n\nThe **5-fold Cross-Validation** consists of the following steps:\n- splitting the dataset into 5 folds of equal size.\n- building 5 different models using the 5 different possible combinations of 4 of the 5 folds as training data.\n- evaluating each model using the remaining fold that was not used to train that model as validation data and obtaining its score value.\n- averaging all the score values obtained in order to provide a good estimation of the generalization performance of the model.\n\nThe **GridSearch 5-fold Cross-Validation** consists of applying the 5-fold Cross-Validation algorithm explained before for each of the possible configurations of hyperparameters that we want to test. As a result, the mean validation score is obtained for each parameter setting and the one that gave the best results is chosen.\n\nGiven the class imbalance, I decided to use different validation scores depending on the type of dataset used: \n- for the original dataset and the dataset reduced by PCA I selected the F1 score, which takes into account the class imbalance and the Precision-Recall trade-off.\n- for the dataset oversampled by SMOTE I selected the Accuracy because the samples of both classes are balanced by the algorithm.\n\nFinally, after having fitted the models using the hypermaters' configurations suggested by the GridSearch 5-fold Cross-Validation, I will evaluate them by having them make predictions on the data samples of the test set.\n\nIn order to properly evaluate each model I will use several metrics, which are defined through the following values:\n- **TP**: the number of true positive samples that have been correctly classified as positives. In our case the positive samples are those with a positive diagnosis of diabetes.\n- **TN**: the number of true negatives samples that have been correctly classified as negatives. In our case the negative samples are those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes.\n- **FP**: the number of true negatives samples that have been wrongly classified as positives.\n- **FN**: the number of true positives samples that have been wrongly classified as negatives.\n\nThe metrics that I will use are the following:\n- **Accuracy**: ${ \\displaystyle \\frac{ \\mathsf{ TP + TN } }{ \\mathsf{ TP + TN + FP + FN } } }$\n\n\n- **Precision**: ${ \\displaystyle \\frac{ \\mathsf{ TP } }{ \\mathsf{ TP + FP } } }$\n\n\n- **Recall**: ${ \\displaystyle \\frac{ \\mathsf{ TP } }{ \\mathsf{ TP + FN } } }$\n\n\n- **F1 Score**: ${ \\displaystyle \\frac{ \\mathsf{ 2TP } }{ \\mathsf{ 2TP + FP + FN } } }$\n\n\n- **Confusion matrix**: it is a square matrix that visually reports the counts of the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions of a classifier.\n\nEach of those metrics provides different information about the performace of a classifier: Accuracy is usually a good metric when dealing with balanced datasets while the other ones are more suitable when there is a class skew or when there are differential misclassification costs, like in our case.\n\nIn fact, predicting an healthy patient as affected by Diabetes would result in further useless analysis and costs, but predicting a deseased one as healthy could result in serious consequences for the health of that person. So, I will give more importance at detecting as many deseased patients as possible (higher Recall score) at the expense of a lower classification accuracy (lower Precision score).\n\nLastly, after having chosen the best classifier among the three built in the previous steps, I will also plot its **learning curve**, which shows the training and the validation scores for several sizes of the training set, for detecting wheter the model suffers from high bias or high variance."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import

Instead, it is possible to replace all the inner products using kernel functions, which are functions that, given two vectors in ${ \\displaystyle \\mathbb{ R }^D }$, implicitly compute the dot product between them in an higher-dimensional space ${ \\displaystyle \\mathbb{ R }^M }$, without explicitly transforming the vectors to ${ \\displaystyle \\mathbb{ R }^M }$.\n\n${ \\displaystyle \\kappa( \\vec{ x }_i, \\vec{ x }_j ) = \\langle \\phi( \\vec{ x }_i ), \\phi( \\vec{ x }_j ) \\rangle }$\n\nOne of the most popular kernel functions for SVMs is the Radial Basis Function:\n\n${ \\displaystyle \\kappa( \\vec{ x }_i, \\vec{ x }_j ) = e^{ - \\gamma || \\space \\vec{ x }_i - \\vec{ x }_j \\space ||^2 } }$\n\nThe hyperparameters that I will test using the GridSearch Cross-Validation are the following:\n- `kernel`: defines the kernel function to be used.\n- `C`: the regularization parameter of the Support Vector Classifier.\n- `gamma`: the parameter of the Radial Basis Kernel.\n- `class_weight`: wheter or not to take in account the class imbalance."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 4.3.1 Model Selection"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.svm import SVC\n\nsvc_param_grid = [ \n    {\n     'kernel': [ 'linear' ],\n     'C': [ 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ],\n     'class_weight': [ None, 'balanced' ] },\n    {\n     'kernel': [ 'rbf' ],\n     'C': [ 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ],\n     'gamma': [ 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ],\n     'class_weight': [ None, 'balanced' ] } ]\n\n\n\nsvc_estimator_names = get_estimator_names( \"SVM\" )\nsvc_best_estimators = grid_search_cross_validation( SVC( random_state=RANDOM_STATE_SEED ), svc_param_grid, svc_estimator_names )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 4.3.2 Model Evaluation"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"svc_test_predictions = test_predictions( svc_best_estimators )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print_compared_cofusion_matrices( svc_test_predictions, svc_estimator_names )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_svc_overall_results = evaluate_test_results( svc_test_predictions, svc_estimator_names )\ndf_svc_overall_results","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The test results clearly show that the SVC trained on the original dataset outperformed the other two.
