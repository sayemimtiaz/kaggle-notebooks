If you're unsure how to do this or would like to work with your own data, please revisit the instructions in the previous tutorial.\n\nOnce you have selected a dataset, click on the **[+ Add Data]** option in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window that you can use to search for your chosen dataset.  \n\n![ex6_search_dataset](https://i.imgur.com/cIIWPUS.png)\n\nOnce you have found the dataset, click on the **[Add]** button to attach it to the notebook.  You can check that it was successful by looking at the **Data** dropdown menu to the right of the notebook -- look for an **input** folder containing a subfolder that matches the name of the dataset.\n\n![ex6_dataset_added](https://i.imgur.com/XOCpdak.png)\n\nYou can click on the carat to the right of the name of the dataset to double-check that it contains a CSV file.  For instance, the image below shows that the example dataset contains two CSV files: (1) **dc-wikia-data.csv**, and (2) **marvel-wikia-data.csv**.\n\n![ex6_dataset_dropdown](https://i.imgur.com/UZOsR6S.png)\n\nOnce you've uploaded a dataset with a CSV file, run the code cell below **without changes** to receive credit for your work!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check for a dataset with a CSV file\nstep_1.check()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 2: Specify the filepath\n\nNow that the dataset is attached to the notebook, you can find its filepath.

You can find the filepath towards the top of this new tab.  \n\n![ex6_filepath](https://i.imgur.com/EssGpuJ.png)\n\nAfter you find the filepath corresponding to your dataset, fill it in as the value for `my_filepath` in the code cell below, and run the code cell to check that you've provided a valid filepath.
