A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n\nThe dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n\nRun the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project.

It can be viewed as a directly proportional relationship.\n* Generally, if there is a high percentage of lower class homeowners in a neighborhood, the prices of the houses in the neighborhood will be less as poor people can't afford expensive houses. Therefore, with the increase in the value of `'LSAT'`, the value of `'MEDV'` should also decrease and vice-versa. It can be viewed as an inversely proportional relationship.\n* According to me the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood mustn't be that detrimental to the price of the houses in the neighborhood. There might be some variation in the prices because of `'PTRATO'` but won't be that substantial when compared with the effects of `'RM'` and `'LSAT'`.

Some questions to answering:\n- How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?\n- Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?\n- Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?\n- Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?\n- Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Answer: **\n* The data collected from 1978 is definitely not that relevant as a lot as changed since then including the demographics, economic strata, inflation rate, per capita income and many more things.\n<br>\n* Currently, there are only three features present in the data, which is definitely not enough to describe a home. Factors such as total income, number of family members, crime rate, distances from public amenities, quality of home appliances, square feet of the plot area, e.t.c. should also factor in. With all these we would be able to create a very accurate model.\n<br>\n* With the given set of features it can be said that the model is robust enough and predicts prices with a less margin of error.\n<br>\n* No, the data collected in an urban city like Boston will not be applicable in a rural city as this would be like comparing apples with oranges. The demographics, economic status, standards of living, requirements and many other major factors are different for a rural city when compared with a city like Boston.\n<br>\n* Mostly, the price of an individual home can be judged based on the characteristics of an entire neighborhood as all the houses in a particular neighborhood are more or less the similar.
