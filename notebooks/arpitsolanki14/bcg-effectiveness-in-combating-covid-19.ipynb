This led to a wider debate on the topic and certain countries starting clinical trials to prove if BCG vaccine may actually provide some protection from Covid in absence of a reliable vaccine or medication. \n\nFew weeks ago I came across this challenge where the purpose is to find insights that might help in the ongoing clinical trials for BCG. Since then I have been working on this hack, the purpose of this notebook is to understand the impact of Covid across the globe and determine if there is any impact on severity of the disease based on BCG vaccine policy within the country. During my research for this problem, I came across number of ongoing clinical trials as well as analysis to study the impact of BCG vaccine and to prove if it can be used to reduce the deaths caused due to Covid. Since the ongoing clinical trials might take some time to be completed, hopefully these insights would be useful in providing some useful information.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"44bfe065-9508-4a23-8179-9e863f05ae83","_cell_guid":"9bd60a65-33f2-486c-a486-9fcbf30ca6f6","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents - \n* [Importing the raw datasets & basic overview of datasets](#introduction)\n* [Potential Areas of Analysis](#analysis)\n* [Status of Covid Pandemic Across the world](#global)\n* [BCG - Impact of Vaccination on Covid-19](#bcg)\n* [Spain vs Portugal](#spain)\n* [Ireland - Cork vs Derry](#ireland)\n* [East Germany vs West Germany](#germany)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c774d5e3-e4ae-4215-a91c-940f6677dfc9","_cell_guid":"10a6711d-5b73-4891-8ef9-a9102c59c25d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing the Raw Datasets<a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n\nThe Competiton provides the following files - \n\n```covid_data.csv```- Contains information about the daily Covid related Confirmed Cases & Deaths for all countries across the globe, sourced from Our World in Data and contains data till 20 June\n\n```bcg_world_atlas.csv``` - Contains the information about BCG policies across countries, start & end date of BCG vaccination, BCG strain used etc.\n\n```germany_province_data.csv``` - Contains information Covid related cases across Germany.\n\nIn addition to these files I also came gathered some datasets from the internet based on the questions that I was looking to answer through my analysis-\n\n```bcg_pnas.csv``` - Dataset used for PNAS research containing details on BCG Coverage and minimum and maximum age groups vaccinated across European countries.\n\n```unicef_bcg_coverage.csv``` - Dataset obtained from UNICEF data warehouse providing stats on BCG coverage from 1980-1920 by country\n\n\n```ireland_data.csv``` - Contains information about the covid cases in Ireland across different counties\n\n```spain_age_group.csv``` - Contains information about the covid cases in Spain for different age groups, contains stats like Hospitalization, ICU & Deaths across age groups. \n\n```portugal_age_group.csv``` - Contains information Covid deaths in Portugal across different age groups.

Divergent BCG vaccination policies existed in the politically divided country (1949–1989) before German reunification in 1990. In East Germany, BCG vaccination programs were established by the communist government in 1951, and soon became compulsory in 1953, leading to near-universal (99.8%) BCG vaccination of newborns by day 3. By contrast, voluntary BCG vaccination (recommended since 1955) was far less common in West Germany, due to low incidence of the disease after the Second World War. In early years, only 7–20% of all newborns became BCG-vaccinated in Western Germany, with almost complete cessation of vaccination between 1975 and 1977.
