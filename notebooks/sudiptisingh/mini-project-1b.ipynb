{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Context\n\nAnimal Crossing is a video game series on Nintendo which allows you to create an island and grow a little village. You start the game with a random set of 3 villagers, and you can find other villagers to invite to your town by visiting mystery islands. You can also add villagers by purchasing amiibo products. You're able to have conversations with your villagers, and you're able to visit their homes. You can even give them gifts within the game, and it helps to choose gifts that are more accurate to their personality/interests. Many users seem to form attachments with their villagers, which is why I'm interested in this research area.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Overview\nThe study of this data stems greatly from the datasets available to compare with, and from my interest in better understanding the villagers' personalities. I am re-using my villagers.csv datafile from A5, which I found from an online Google Doc, and am also incorporating a second dataset that offers 4 different CSV files for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which include user reviews, critic reviews, villager data, and item data (the only data I'm not using from this is the item data). After doing the zodiac analysis on my original villager dataset, I realized I had more questions about villagers from past versions of the game, so I incorporated a third dataset that shows villager data from Animal Crossing: New Leaf.\n\nMy overarching goal for both Mini Project 1 and 2 is to gain a better understanding of the personalities of villagers and how their personalities relate to experiences/attachment of users with villagers. I'd like to ask questions like the following:\n* What do users and critics have to say about the games? Is there any reference to villagers?\n* What traits are most commonly found in villagers?\n* What impact do these traits have on likability by users, and the overall experience of the game?\n* Is there some reason why some villagers are more or less liked by users?","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Profile\nI would like to extract data from the villagers and compare it against common astrology themes to learn more about different aspects of the villagers' personalities. From this, I would utilize the columns that describe the villager name, birthday, and personality type. I may also be interested in exploring things like favorite colors or songs. \n\nThe limits to this may be that there is no column with an interpretation of the labels. For example, it might be nice to have data about what genre their favorite songs fall into, or what the color theory of their favorite colors are. This could help further my analysis, but would need to be entered manually if I wanted to study it (I mean, technically I could use Python to add an extra column but that would only be helpful if the songs reappeared multiple times--it would be helpful if I wanted to do this for the colors). Things I wouldn’t need from this dataset are information about the items, wallpaper, flooring, furniture, filename, and unique entry ID. These are not needed because either they look like gibberish (random numbers that don’t mean anything in this context), or because they are not repetitive themes. For example, colors reappear for various villagers, but only a few may have the same wallpaper/flooring overlap. This makes it harder to identify patterns. \n\nI’m interested in this data because I’ve been playing a LOT of Animal Crossing: New Horizons lately and the fanbase is super fascinating to me. Some people get really attached to the villagers in the game, and there’s a bit of astrology within the game (star fragment types vary based on what astrology season it is). I also don’t believe in astrology, so I find this extra interesting because it means I need to find meaning or patterns in something I don’t quite understand. It’ll be a fun exercise to learn more about how these villagers were created and if there are identifiable patterns that can help us learn more about them (for example, maybe this information could help users pick better “gifts” for their villagers, as that’s a sizable part of the game/interaction with villagers for many users).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Setup**\n\nI'm starting with some initial checks to familiarize myself with the data, to have a place to double-check what datasets are in the file, and to import the necessary libraries.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np #linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd #data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport os\n\n#read and list all files in input\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n#read and list all files in output\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/working'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#import another library (we don't need all of matplotlib) and give it a shorthand name\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom os import path\n#import image to be able to export wordclouds\nfrom PIL import Image\n#import wordcloud library for special visualizations\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator\n\n#state the plot style to be used throughout\nplt.style.use('seaborn')\n\n#create a variable to read the dataframes we're interested in exploring\ndf_critic = pd.read_csv('../input/animal-crossing/critic.csv')\ndf_user = pd.read_csv('../input/animal-crossing/user_reviews.csv')\n#this is a revised version of the new villager dataset, not the one I used in A5\n#the revision was done by opening Excel and changing formatting of the birthday column\n#the revision is just a change in the formatting of the villagers birthdates so I can use them to check against my zodiac sign lists\ndf_villagers = pd.read_csv('../input/animalcrossingrevised/villagers.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#for a quick overview of data in the critic review dataset\ndf_critic.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analysis #1: WordCloud Exploration\nHere, I'm studying the different ways of exploring user and critic reviews through wordclouds.

Analysis 1 shows that the main points of discussion around critic and user reviews have to do with \"one island\" or \"per island\", which refers to the fact that you can only have one island per Switch console. This seems to be a popular point of contention around how people view the platform. \"Villager\" appears on both word clouds but is not particularly large point of discussion. I wonder if this has to do with villagers not being something people tend to complain about, or something that works so well that it's not something notable enough for a review?\n\nAnalysis 2 shows the trends in villager personalities, and how these have changed in the last two major games of the series. I think this is more helpful if you have some zodiac sign data to compare to, so here's a short snippet of zodiac descriptions I pulled from the first Google link that shows up when searching \"zodiac sign and description\" (accuracy or looking for a specific link to explain the signs doesn't seem important here as, in my opinion, a lot of astrology feels made up...). You can check it out in-depth here: https://www.allure.com/story/zodiac-sign-personality-traits-dates This analysis raised many questions about directions for future work, which I will elaborate on below.\n\n**Aries (March 21 - April 19)**\n\nAries loves to be number one, so it’s no surprise that these audacious rams are the first sign of the zodiac.

Here's a few of the questions I'd like to explore, if I had more time to learn how to try to answer these:\n\n**Question 1: Which zodiac signs are found most often within certain personality types?**\nI would try to do this by doing multiple-bar graphs which would show, for example, how many Leo, Capricorn, Aries, etc. villagers are of the \"Snooty\" personality type or the \"Cranky\" personality type. I think this would be fascinating to see if the zodiac sign their personality relates to is indeed a representative of the personality type they are.\n\n**Question 2: Which zodiac signs are found most often within certain style types?**\nThis would be done the same way as question 1, but I might need to find a way to reconcile the fact that there are two different style types. Would I only use \"Style 1\" data? Maybe a second graph would show \"Style 2\"? Is there a way to relate the combination of three different datasets and how many times they occur in a similar grouping (for example, \"Pisces\" but also \"Cool\" and \"Simple\" style should appear as 1 count and \"Pisces\" with \"Simple\" and \"Cool\" should also count as a 2nd occurrence)?\n\n**Question 3: Which zodiac signs prefer which songs the most?**\nThis one sounds super fun because first I'd want to run a script that dictates what genre each song belongs to. Then, I'd want to graph the data similar to Question 1 where I'd want to see which songs are most common for which zodiac signs (for example, how many and what genres occur under the \"Aries\" zodiac sign?). \n\nFor mini project 2, I would continue this work not necessarily by answering the questions below, but by running a sentiment analysis on some set of tweets relating to Animal Crossing and villagers. I'm very interested in the topic of personalities of villagers and am mostly trying to figure out how I can continue to analyze that from a machine learning perspective.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
