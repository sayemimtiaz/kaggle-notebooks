has to be examined properly at the EDA stage;\n- One new column (`age-types`) was added to the data; \n- We have ten categorical including the target column (income) and six quantitative columns. \n\nThe main:\n\n- The min age is 17, the max age is 90;\n- The top worklass is 'Private';\n- the most frequent education type is \"Prof-specialty\";\n- White race and male sex are top in the
