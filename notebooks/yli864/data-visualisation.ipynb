The data set can be accessed by the link: https://www.kaggle.com/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates\nAs the website showed, the data is from The Nobel Foundation. It contains 969 rows and 18 columns, mainly ordered by year. However, as there is a long history of the Nobel Prize, some of the data in this data set are not updated, like some country or area is changed their name by history reason. A small part of laureates‘ information is missing, including the birth date, birth location, and gender information. I tried to filter the missing information and also corrected the location name before visualization. Overall, the data set is had high usability.\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
