Find articles relevant to Coronavirus and Covid-19 by matching abstracts using **TF-IDF**\n\n### Loading Data into DF\nWe load data from both summary csv file and all availiable text / abstracts from additional .json files. A quick scan through all the artcles in the dataset reveals that only a fraction in the dataset are pertaining to Coronaviruses. We thus propose the following:\n* Perform a query on all Abstracts to find matches of articles discussing Coronavirus and dump the rest. We make the assumption that if Coronavirus/Covid is not mentioned in the abstract, the article is likely not about Coronavirus/Covid.\n* After finding the relevant abstracts, we extract the body/full-text of the article to perform Q&A subsequently. Since not all abstracts have a full-text, we will only look for abstracts with full-text via their SHA.

As opposed to current state-of-the-art language models that makes use of attention mechanisms to learn contextual representations, a simple Bag-of-Words representation has poor contextual representation.\n* For convenience, we used the BERT-finetuned-on-SQuAD model available from Huggingface transformers. This model was pretrained on corpora of texts from Wikipedia and fine-tuned on questions posed on Wikipedia articles (SQuAD). A possible improvement would be to use models that are pre-trained on more relevant domain-specific corpus such as BioBERT or SciBERT (which have been pre-trained on biomedical and scientific publications respectively), and/or further fine-tuning on domain-specific Q&A datasets. One such example could be the PubMedQA Dataset (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06146).
