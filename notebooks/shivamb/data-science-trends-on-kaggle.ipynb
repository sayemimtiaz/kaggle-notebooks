The generel trend is that number of discussions are increasing every month. \n> - One indication is that there are more number of classification problems than regression problems on Kaggle including the most popular **Titanic Survival Prediction competition**. This competition has most number of discussions and is one of the longest running compeition on Kaggle. There is a regression competition as well : House Prices advanced regression, but people more often start it after titanic only.     \n> - The number of logistic regression discussions on forums, kernel comments, and replies boomed to high numbers in October 2017 and March 2018.

But when XgBoost was open sourced in 2014, it gained popularty quickly and **dominated the kaggle competitions and kernels**. Today, xgboost is still used exhaustively in compeitions and is the part of the winning models of many competitions. Some examples are **Otto Group Classification Competition** in which first place solution made use of xgboost. \n> - However with the arrival of **Lightgbm in 2016**, the useage of xgboost dipped to some extent and popularity of lightgbm started rising very quickly. Based on the recent increasing trend of lightgbm (shown in red), one can forecast that it will dominate next few years as well, unless any other company opensources a better model.  For example, lightgbm was used in the winning solution of **Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction** . One of the reason for light gbm popularity is the faster implementation and simple interface as compared to xgboost.  \n> - For instance, Catboost was recently released and is starting gaining popularity.  \n\n\n## 3.

The number of discussions related to deep learning is increasing regularly and are always more than neural networks. Also, many cloud instance providers such as **Amazon AWS, Google cloud** etc showcases their capabilities of training very deep neural networks on clouds.  \n> - The deeplearning models also became popular because of a number of Image Classification competitions on Kaggle such as :  **Data Science Bowl**, competitions from Google etc. Also, deeplearning models became popular for text classification problems for example **Quora Duplicate Questions Classification**.  \n> - Deep learning is also become populary every month because of different variants of models such as RNNs, CNNs have shown great improvements in the kernels. Also, **transfer learning and pre-trained models** have shown great results in competitions.  \n> - Kaggle can launch more competitions / playgrounds related to Image Classification Modelling as people wants to learn from them alot.  Not to forget that Kaggle have added the GPU support in kernels which facilitates the Deep Learning useage on kaggle.  \n\n## 4.

These two tasks have the most important significance in the best and accurate models.
