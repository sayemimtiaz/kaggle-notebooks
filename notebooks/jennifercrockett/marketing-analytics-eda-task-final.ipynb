You need to analyze the data set to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions.  \n\n**Section 01: Exploratory Data Analysis**  \n* Are there any null values or outliers? How will you wrangle/handle them?\n* Are there any variables that warrant transformations?\n* Are there any useful variables that you can engineer with the given data?\n* Do you notice any patterns or anomalies in the data? Can you plot them?\n\n**Section 02: Statistical Analysis**  \nPlease run statistical tests in the form of regressions to answer these questions & propose data-driven action recommendations to your CMO. Make sure to interpret your results with non-statistical jargon so your CMO can understand your findings.  \n\n* What factors are significantly related to the number of store purchases?\n* Does US fare significantly better than the Rest of the World in terms of total purchases?\n* Your supervisor insists that people who buy gold are more conservative. Therefore, people who spent an above average amount on gold in the last 2 years would have more in store purchases. Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test\n* Fish has Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for the brain. Accordingly, do \"Married PhD candidates\" have a significant relation with amount spent on fish? What other factors are significantly related to amount spent on fish? (Hint: use your knowledge of interaction variables/effects)\n* Is there a significant relationship between geographical regional and success of a campaign?\n\n**Section 03: Data Visualization**  \nPlease plot and visualize the answers to the below questions.  \n\n* Which marketing campaign is most successful?\n* What does the average customer look like for this company?\n* Which products are performing best?\n* Which channels are underperforming?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset\n\nBefore beginning the analysis, we will load and view the dataset, and perform some initial cleaning.\n\n* View the dataset info:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load libraries\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set_context('notebook')\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\nsns.set_palette('Blues_r')\n\n# turn off warnings for final notebook\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# load dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/marketing-data/marketing_data.csv')\nprint(df.info())\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Clean up column names\n* Transform selected columns to numeric format:\n    - `Income` to float"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# clean up column names that contain whitespace\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.replace(' ', '')\n\n# transform Income column to a numerical\ndf['Income'] = df['Income'].str.replace('$', '')\ndf['Income'] = df['Income'].str.replace(',', '').astype('float')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* The cleaned dataset:"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Section 01: Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n### Are there any null values or outliers?
