Many researchers use **Prophet** (from Facebook). But for some reason, no one takes into account the holidays impact. After all, despite all the prohibitions, it is difficult for people to stay at home and they still somehow celebrate the **holidays** to which they are accustomed. The desire to celebrate is especially strong when people are sitting at home all the time looking for something to do. In our opinion, the impact of the holidays is manifested in the fact that within 4-10 days after these holidays there may be a jump in the number of confirmed cases, due to the fact that people went shopping, and even visiting each other, perhaps even in violation of quarantine requirements. \n\nThe Prophet uses the library [holidays](https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays) with information about the main holidays of 67 countries, but and its package has some disadvantages. That's why I created a more perfect own dataset and plan to update it periodically. My graduate students ( ) help me fill it. Now my dataset [COVID-19: Holidays of countries](https://www.kaggle.com/vbmokin/covid19-holidays-of-countries) has holidays for 70 countries and more adapted for use in the prediction of coronavirus diseases. \n\nWe will limit myself to forecasting only those countries for which there is information about holidays for Prophet.\n\nA multiplicative Prophet model is built taking into account the weekly and triply (3 days) seasonality, first without taking into account the holidays, and then taking into account the holidays. Then the model is tuned according to the parameter \"prior_scale\" that gets the value from the list of the user and is searching the one that provides the best forecast of the 14 last values of the data. The optimal model is determined for each country (with or without holidays, the best value of parameter \"prior_scale\" ). \n\nThe model with optimal parameters is used to predict future data for the next 3 days. The data is taken from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) (usually this dataset are updated there daily and are available as of yesterday), so the next 3 days are counted from the date of the last committee of this notebook. \n\nFor the best models, plots with forecast values and with all components of the model are built.\n\nThere is a version of this notebook with model validation, there are versions for some countries, where the model is tuned simultaneously for all three parameters of the holidays (lower_window, upper_window, prior_scale) - see among [notebooks of the dataset **\"COVID-19: Holidays of countries\"**](https://www.kaggle.com/vbmokin/covid19-holidays-of-countries/notebooks)\n\nAdded holidays in 70 countries in **2021** to those that were in 2020.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The forecast for all countries with the tuning of only one parameter (prior_scale) gives low accuracy unfortunately. The purpose of this notebook is to show how to use a holiday [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vbmokin/covid19-holidays-of-countries) for 70 countries.\n\nHigher forecasting accuracy (up to 2-6% for 7 days) is achieved by tuning 11 parameters for each country individually - see their list in the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vbmokin/covid19-holidays-of-countries). For example, see notebooks for Ukraine.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"0.1\"></a>\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Import libraries](#1)\n1.
