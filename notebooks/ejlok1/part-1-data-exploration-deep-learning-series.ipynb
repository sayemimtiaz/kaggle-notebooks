If I do write a blog post about this, I will update this kernel. But for now, just the Jupyter notebook as a kernel, and my very first one!\n\nBefore we begin, I just wanted to say that my first real heavy involvement in audio was back in March 2018 whilst doing the Audio competition on __[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging)__, Thanks to that competition and the awesome community support, I had learnt alot and so I wanted to contribute back to the community in the same way.

There's a few objectives worth pursuing on top of my head and they are: \n- building a gender predictor from voice\n- building an accent predictor by Country from voice (or Birthplace)\n\nAll we could build all 2 applications above, starting from the easiest first being the gender predictor. The gender predictor will serve as our prototype and once we've built it, we'll expand to Country, and then maybe by Birthplace. I'm not even sure if Birthplace is viable objective but lets re-evaluate when we circle back to this. For now, **lets run with Gender first**. Also note that we don't have to limit ourselves with supervised modelling. There's many more we can do: \n- Audio fingerprinting \n- Emotion analysis (Text and Voice)\n- Speed, inflection etc etc\n- Others \n\nThere's alot you can do with audio, but we'll look at these at a later stage. Meantime, the show must go on, and we will stick to our simple objective. Lets now run a few more examples of male and female audio files. This time, I want to hear the US Southern Accent.
