Unlike time series analyzes, the model uses regression techniques to predict the rates of change as a function of the current number of contaminations, deaths and recoveries over time. With this, I hope that the model will be able to learn how the time derivatives change as we observe variations (even sudden ones) in the numbers of cases and, after a numerical integration, be able to predict future data with greater precision than simple temporal projection with regressors in time series analysis techniques.*\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdemor/Covid-Brasil/main/source/india_results.png\">"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.048918,"end_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:58.594096","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:58.545178","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"toc\"></a>\n  \n  \n  <div  style=\"margin-top: 9px; background-color: #efefef; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;margin-bottom: 9px;box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 0px rgba(87, 87, 87, 0.2);\">\n    <center>\n        <h2>Content</h2>\n    </center>\n\n   \n<ol>\n    <li><a href=\"#01\" style=\"color: #37509b;\">Description</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#02\" style=\"color: #37509b;\">Introduction</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#03\" style=\"color: #37509b;\">Dataset</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#04\" style=\"color: #37509b;\">Model</a></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n</div>"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.044632,"end_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:58.685332","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:58.6407","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"01\" style=\"\n  background-color: #37509b;\n  border: none;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 2px 10px;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-size: 10px;\" href=\"#toc\">TOC ↻</a>\n  \n  \n<div  style=\"margin-top: 9px; background-color: #efefef; padding-left:35px; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;margin-bottom: 9px;box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 0px rgba(87, 87, 87, 0.2);\">\n    \n<h1>1.

It is to be expected that the number of susceptible people will be a dynamic variable, since cases of reinfection are practically non-existent (or certainly very unlikely in relation to cases of first infection). This variable is called:\n\n\n* $S(t)$: number of individuals susceptible to infection over time $t$\n\n\nSusceptible people, when infected, leave the group of $S(t)$ and become $C(t)$. As a consequence:\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dS}{dt}+\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0, \\tag{1}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n\nIntuitively, the rate of infection is correlated with the number of susceptible people and the number of people actively infected. A simple model of this relationship is:\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_s S(t) I(t) \\label{eq:propC} \\tag{2a} ,$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\nwhich, through equation (1), naturally leads to:\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$\\frac{dS}{dt} = - k_s S(t) I(t) \\label{eq:propS} \\tag{2b} ,$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n\nwhere $k_s > 0$. \n\nAnother expected behavior is that both the rate of people recovered and the rate of deaths are proportional in a given time $ t $ to the number of people actively infected:\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = k_r I(t) \\label{eq:propR} \\tag{3a}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\ne\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = k_d I(t) \\label{eq:propD} \\tag{3b}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\nwhere $k_r,k_d > 0$. \n\nAlternatively, you can use the link $ C(t) = I (t) + R (t) + D (t) $ to deduct the differential equation for $ I (t) $:\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\left( k_s S(t) - k_r - k_d\\right)I(t)  \\label{eq:propI} \\tag{4}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\nThe model described above is well founded, but takes several hypotheses into account. It has been successfully applied to describe the evolution of Covid-19 in different regions. However, these hypotheses are associated with idealized cases and, because of this, the model is not general enough to adapt to the modeling of Covid-19 cases. When this occurs, the authors call for generalizations of the models, generally based on different equations of the type:\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = f_s(S(t),I(t),D(t),R(t)), \\tag{5a}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = f_i(S(t),I(t),D(t),R(t)), \\tag{5b}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = f_d(S(t),I(t),D(t),R(t)), \\tag{5c}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = f_r(S(t),I(t),D(t),R(t)), \\tag{5d}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\nwhere the algebraic functions $ f_s $, $ f_i $, $ f_d $ and $ f_r $ are determined according to the problem under study.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest problem with the application of epidemiological models to Covid-19 modeling is in the human factor. Several times, pathological behaviors were observed in the curves of Covid-19 (as in the case of China and the USA), which are abrupt or even mild changes, but which do not respect the equations in the model. What is wrong in this case is, in general, due to human action. Whether by changing collective behavior (collective abandonment of isolation rules), political influence on social behavior, changes in public policy rules, etc. In such cases, Machine Learning models can be used."},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.043758,"end_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:59.143743","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:59.099985","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> [1] Ranjan, R.

There is a wide range of approaches, but the dynamic variables $ C (t) $, $ D (t) $, $ R (t) $ and $ I (t) $ are generally taken as time series. As this approach is data oriented, there is no reference to the dynamic variable $ S (t) $, since it carries an abstract notion (that of the number of susceptible people) that is something inaccessible. This type of approach, in the short term, is quite satisfactory because it allows forecasts of the evolution of the disease in the coming days. However, in the long run, predictions are more dispersed and inaccurate. The reason for this is that the learning models with this characteristic relate each of the dynamic variables only with time. However, as discussed in the topic of epidemiological models, there are correlations between the variables $ C (t) $, $ D (t) $, $ R (t) $ and $ I (t) $.\n\nThe model proposed here is described as follows: I want to obtain a set of different equations similar to that of Eqs. (5), however, considering $ C (t) $ instead of $ I (t) $.\n\n* Since it is not possible to accurately infer a time series for $ S (t) $, this variable won't be considered.\n* In addition, I want to allow $ f $ functions to depend directly on time to.\n\nIn these considerations, the system will be reduced to:\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = f_c(t,C(t),D(t),R(t)), \\tag{6a}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = f_d(t,C(t),D(t),R(t)), \\tag{6b}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n<center>\n$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = f_r(t,C(t),D(t),R(t)), \\tag{6c}$\n</center>\n\n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n* The $ f $ functions will be determined by applying regression models. With this, I will obtain three models of machine learning capable of predicting the variation rates of $ C $, $ D $ and $ R $ receiving data from $ t_ {in} $, $ C (t_ {in}) $, $ D (t_ {in}) $ and $ R (t_ {in}) $ as input.\n\n* With the variation rates model, I can integrate the model in the opposite direction, taking the last data as an initial condition. In this process, the machine learning model will be validated\n\n* As the model validated, future predictions can be performed"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.044192,"end_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:59.532421","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:59.488229","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdemor/Covid-Brasil/main/source/tenor.gif)"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.046797,"end_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:59.632755","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-20T11:01:59.585958","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"02\" style=\"\n  background-color: #37509b;\n  border: none;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 2px 10px;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-size: 10px;\" href=\"#toc\">TOC ↻</a>\n  \n  \n<div  style=\"margin-top: 9px; background-color: #efefef; padding-left:35px; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;margin-bottom: 9px;box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 0px rgba(87, 87, 87, 0.2);\">\n    \n<h1>2.
