{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is not going to be a nice notebook to read nor it wants to be a personal attack against anyone but rather a quick snapshot of how healthy is our community.\n\nIt has been a while that I notice more and more users getting high kaggle ranks in a short amount of time (people becoming expert within a day, or masters in a month) and, reading the forums very frequently, I have also noticed that the comments are becoming more and more in the lines of *thanks for sharing* and *please upvote my other work*.\n\nVery often I notice nice notebooks being published with even some non-trivial approach in it that could spark interesting conversations and a little army of users that just post links to their own notebook about another topic, completely unrelated to what they are commenting.\n\nTherefore, I decided to check if it is me getting grumpy the older I get or the quality of the forums is significantly dropping.\n\nThis notebook will focus on 4 things: \n\n* Average number of questions asked over time\n* Average number of requests of upvotes over time\n* Average number of self-promoting comments over time\n* Average number of thank you over time\n\nTo do so, Meta Kaggle is the perfect dataset."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import
