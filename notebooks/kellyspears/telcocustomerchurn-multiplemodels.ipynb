Import libraries and data\n2. Get an understanding of the data: relationships between features, check for imbalanced supervisor, remove possible outliers\n3. Build models using original dataset and data sampled using SMOTE to account for imbalanced casses\n4. Build models based on internet service type\n\nWhat I am doing with this notebook is illustrating that building an effective model for the entire dataset can be supplemented with building models for specific subsets of the data.\n\nMore specifically, I'll build a model to predict customer churn given no specifics about the customer. I'll then build models for customers who have DSL internet and those that have no internet. In order to get the best predictions, based on the attributes of a customer, a company could use the general model, or if they know the customer has DSL or no internet, they can use those specific models to generate more accurate predictions.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, f1_score, recall_score, precision_score, accuracy_score, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n\n# Import dataset\nfile_path = '/kaggle/input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(file_path)\ndf.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check for missing values\nif df.isna().sum().sum() == 0:\n    print('No missing values.')\n\n# Check for duplicate customerIDs\nif df['customerID'].duplicated().any() == False:\n    print('No duplicate customers.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check feature datatypes\ndf.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Understand number of unique values for each categorical feature\ndf.select_dtypes(object).nunique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Below, I'll plot three features with customer churn:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Choose a few features to look into with regards to churn\ncols_vis = ['InternetService','PaymentMethod','Contract']\nsns.set()\ncust_pal = ['#157DEC','#4CC552']\nsns.set_palette(cust_pal)\nfor i in range(0,len(cols_vis)):\n    df_plot = pd.DataFrame(df.groupby([cols_vis[i],'Churn'])['Churn'].count())\n    df_plot.rename(columns = {'Churn': 'TotalCustomers'}, inplace=True)\n    df_plot.reset_index(inplace = True)\n    chart = sns.barplot(x=cols_vis[i], y='TotalCustomers', hue=\"Churn\", data=df_plot)\n    plt.ylabel(\"Total Customers\", size=14)\n    plt.xlabel(cols_vis[i], size=14)\n    chart.set_xticklabels(chart.get_xticklabels(), rotation=30)\n    plt.title(\"Customer Churn by \" + cols_vis[i], size=18)\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The contract vs. customer churn plot seems obvious - those in a two-year contract might face some monetary penalty for leaving, thus leading to very low customer churn.\n\nCustomer churn across payment methods looks pretty stable with the exception of customers who pay by electronic check, of which there are more that churn than the other methods. That could be something to look into in further work.\n\nCustomer churn by internet service was particularly interesting to me. It appears that customer with no internet have the lowest churn, and those with the fastest speed (fiber optic) have the highest rate of churn. Could it be that the speeds aren't as advertised, or perhaps the service is too expensive?
