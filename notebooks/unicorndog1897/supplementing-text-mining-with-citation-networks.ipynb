{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Text-mining techniques are effective for helping to answer a specific research question and for identifying similar articles.  However, the quality of the answer given is just as important as having an answer:\n\nIf asking \"What conditions make someone more susceptible to contracting COVID-19?\", you might be recommended this article via text-mining: [Relationship between the ABO Blood Group and the COVID-19 Susceptibility](http://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096v2)\n\nA confirmed relationship between blood type and susceptibility to COVID19 might greatly impact how COVID19 tests are given and distributed.  I've already seen this article being shared on social media sites.  However, this study did not utilize a large sample size, and there work has not been replicated.  A researcher might be able to make a more informed decision if they viewed similar papers on the MERS coronavirus.\n\nAdditionally, to fully understand the papers recommended, you might need to look at some articles for background knowledge.  However, articles discussing similar topics might cite different background papers, some of which could be out of date, while others rapidly gain popularity with researchers.  With the way COVID19 research is rapidly growing and changing, background knowledge may become out of date quickly.  Therefore, it would be useful to visualize which background papers are the highest-cited by a set of recommended articles.\n\n\nHow do you address these issues?  Article metadata, specifically, an analysis of article citations.  Commonly, the relationship between (source) articles and the ones they cite is visualized in the form of a directed graph, where sources \"point\" to their citations:\n\n\n![](https://3spxpi1radr22mzge33bla91-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/citation-cartel-closeup.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this notebook, I'll demonstrate how to make citation networks utilizing the COVID19 articles, as well as how to incorporate the graphs into text mining results. All of these graphs are created with pyvis: https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html  Feel free to repurpose/copy the notebook code in whatever way suits your needs and project.  \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Pros to this approach:**\n* Citation graphs can be incorporated into any approach.  If your method of choice is clustering, you could create a feature to generate a pyvis graph for a cluster or clusters selected by a user\n\n* Reduces the amount of time researchers/users have to spend hunting for the most established article or background paper on a topic\n\n* If made interactive, users can identify \"missing links,\" or articles between several topics that could answer multiple questions at once\n\n* This could save users of a tool time and help them decide which articles are the most credible, or, at least, most frequently acknowledged/regarded within the COVID19 research community\n\n\n**Cons to this approach:**\n* Citation data has to be updated every time new articles are added to the collection.  \n* Graphs are (computationally) expensive.  Although the graphs in this demo can be Jupyter Notebook outputs, if you wanted to create citation networks for a couple thousand nodes (or, say, a half of the 50k corpus), you would have to move this feature to a website.\n* The JSON files, not the cleaner metadata, contained all the citations.  There are far more cited articles than cited articles with metadata.  This poses limitations when creating interactive graphs that display a url, abstract, etc.\n\n* The citation graph is only as useful as the text mining technique recommending/filtering articles. With that in mind...\n### ***Important Note*: The code to perform LDA / recommend articles is the work of Daniel Wolffram.
