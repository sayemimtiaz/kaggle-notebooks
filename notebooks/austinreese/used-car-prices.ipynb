One way to do this is compare prices by other numeric factors, in this case either mileage accumulated or year of manufacturing. A reasonable approach would be to compare these two variables using percentiles in order to see what the going rate for a car in the 20th-30th percentile of miles accumulated is on average. The program above takes this one step further by not only calculating a single mean for each category, but instead displaying another 10 price percentiles per categorical percentile. This sounds somewhat complicated but visually it makes far more sense."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"display(buildPercentileFrame(data, \"price\", \"odometer\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets start with something simple. This category compares mean price by odometer for every vehicle in the dataset. Lets analyze a hypothetical car with 55,000 miles (falling within the 46,000 and 69,400 miles category). A fantastic price would be around \\$3,250 (mean of cars within 0 and 10th percentile of price). An average price would be around \\$15,000, while a poor price would be anything above $20,000\n\nAlso, quick explanation as to why the first row of low odometers is far cheaper than it should be. I've spent lots of time pouring over craigslist cars+trucks over the past months due to this project and several others, and it's pretty common for used car dealerships and even individuals to list the odometer as 0 even though the car is clearly used.

The size of the data we're dealing with has also shrunk quite a bit, down to ~10,000 which is certainly more refined than ~1,700,000.\n\nOverall this is a helpful tool to determine what a fair selling (or buying) price is when hunting for used cars.
