This output may also be seen in Version 33 of this kernel.**\n\n# Introduction\nQuestion answering (QA) is a challenging task for machines, since it requires two things: 1) the ability to comprehend natural, human language and 2) knowledge about the world we live in.  It is a leading problem in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) research, mainly because QA is a suitable benchmark by which machines' ability to understand complex human reasoning is measured.  In the past, the bulk of QA consisted of text retrieval methods, which relied largely on matching patterns.  Today, the field has progressed to include deep-learning architectures, and the use cases of QA have become both broader and deeper.\n\nOur proposed solution, nicknamed COBERT (a health-care application of BERT), concerns the body of research around COVID-19.  It uses a mixture of pattern matching and deep-learning architectures to generate insightful tables of information from tens of thousands of scientific abstracts.\n\n# Related Work\nBERT [1], a deep Transformer architecture, was introduced in 2018 and achieved SOTA results on SQuAD 2.0 [5].  ALBERT [2] uses two parameter reduction techniques to achieve better results than BERT while also having fewer parameters (namely, \"A Lite BERT\").  These techniques are \"factorized embedding parameterization\" and \"cross-layer parameter sharing,\" which allows ALBERT to share all parameters across layers.\n\n# Approach\n\n## Original Work\nOur solution is based on a combination of techniques; specifically, pattern matching, occasionally with the help of GloVe embeddings, alongside a high-performing QA model, ALBERT.  We found ALBERT suitable for this use case given the resource allotment of the environment.\n\nFirst, we process the data to include abstracts which are relevant to the question asked.  There are exactly 10 questions which comprise this task.  To achieve this, we identify a key word from the text of the question.  Then, we use Stanford's GloVe 100d word embeddings to generate a list of words which have a strong cosine similarity with the key word.  Next, we iterate through the abstracts and match those similar words to text of the abstracts.  We hypothesize that if an abstract contains a word in this list, then there is a strong likelihood that abstract will be relevant to our question.\n\nThen, we use an ALBERT-xlarge model to answer questions about each abstract.  These questions include: \"What are factors of COVID-19?\", \"How does <factor> influence COVID-19?\", and \"How many countries?\".  We use the model as a question-answering engine which has specific knowledge about COVID-19.\n\n# Conclusions\nUsing the above approach, we were able to generate summary tables which correspond to the target tables in the challenge.  We would like to highlight a few discoveries:\n\n## Insightful QA\nThis proposal derives meaning from the text, allowing us to retrieve words and phrases which closely match the descriptions in the challenge.  As a result, we found we did not need to retrieve large excerpts and passages, which gives the output a more human readable quality somewhat matching the target tables.\n\n## Customizable Questions\nOur approach is customizable in that it is possible to add to the lists of questions which get passed to ALBERT-xlarge: `factors_questions` and `evidence_questions`.  Adding more questions will take additional computing time, but probably lead to more accurate information.\n\n## Extensible, Easy-To-Understand Code\nWe believe our solution is generalizable to other tasks.  We have tried to keep it as humanly understandable as possible, as well as free from hard-coded values.\n\n\n## Computational Resources\nWe found this approach, while compelling, to be computationally expensive.  Using a QA model, like ALBERT, to answer questions allowed us to derive insights, but at the cost of greater time to compute the growing volume of scientific papers.  Running COBERT on even one question across the full list of relevant abstracts took more than 3 hours.  As a result, we have provided a hard-coded list of abstracts taken from the target tables to demonstrate that COBERT can re-create the target tables (as much as possible).  We predict that additional computational resources, architectures, and time would allow our approach to scale appropriately with a full run.\n\n## Improvements\nWe can fine-tune our model to better understand the medical data in these abstracts on a data set like MedQuAD: https://github.com/abachaa/MedQuAD.  Additionally, our model, and any BERT-based model, will derive knowledge from the context itself and return a span containing the answer to a question.  It is possible to improve performance with a repository of related knowledge, instead of just the information found in the text.\n\n# Acknowledgements\nWe relied heavily on this ALBERT-xlarge-v2 model trained on SQuAD v2: https://huggingface.co/ktrapeznikov/albert-xlarge-v2-squad-v2 with credit to Kirill Trapeznikov.\n\n# References\n[1] Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova.
