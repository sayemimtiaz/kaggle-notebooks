Pro-tip: click between the **<** and **>** for a menu of the pages. The first page is for detailed analysis of the results, the later pages are summary statistics to help explain the task-risk methods including a page of Keyword/ngram word clouds.\n\nLike all Power BI reports, the visuals are highly interactive. Select a bar or row in almost any visual to cross-filter the other visuals on the page. Ctrl-click to multi-select (across visuals and/or within a visual).\n\n**Suggested method of use:**\nFirst use the slicers and visuals at the top of the page to narrow the list of papers down to your topic of interest. Then select a paper of interest from the central table - that will filter the details table below. To review the details table in full screen, use the **Focus mode** button in the top-right corner of the details table.\n\nThis visualisation helps to explore the results from the CoronaWhy Task-Risk team datasets.  [More info in this Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/arturkiulian/coronawhy-org-task-risk-factors). The key attributes focused on are the Risk Factor and Keywords/Ngrams used to search the papers for that Risk Factor.  This was a quick early effort at visualisation, which should evolve over time in response to feedback.\n\nThe secondary data source is the metadata file and associated json files from the [CORD-19 Research Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/).  \n\n> The input data is presented in some quick visuals to assist exploration and understanding of the data.\n\nA static export of the visuals is [available here in PowerPoint format](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pX3NmeFe50nXcPgRvHpMx1rjczAXew7h)."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
