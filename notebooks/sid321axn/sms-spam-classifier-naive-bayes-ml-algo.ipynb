There are various mechanisms for doing so, but first let's do quick recap of them.\n\n**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n\n**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam. It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classification), in other words it is the ratio of\n\n**[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]**\n\n**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam. It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n\n**[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]**\n\nFor classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score.\n\nWe will be using all 4 metrics to make sure our model does well. For all 4 metrics whose values can range from 0 to 1, having a score as close to 1 as possible is a good indicator of how well our model is doing."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0bc4167d3ff888530c292ae0ed7a8e924e8caf30"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score\nprint('Accuracy score: {}'.format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)))\nprint('Precision score: {}'.format(precision_score(y_test, predictions)))\nprint('Recall score: {}'.format(recall_score(y_test, predictions)))\nprint('F1 score: {}'.format(f1_score(y_test, predictions)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"db41456bf07a7de127c3368b1f0db87c5632d512"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One of the major advantages that **Naive Bayes** has over other classification algorithms is its ability to handle an extremely large number of features. In our case, each word is treated as a feature and there are thousands of different words. Also, it performs well even with the presence of irrelevant features and is relatively unaffected by them.\n\nThe other major advantage it has is its relative simplicity. Naive Bayes' works well right out of the box and tuning it's parameters is rarely ever necessary, except usually in cases where the distribution of the data is known. \n\nIt rarely ever overfits the data.\n\nAnother important advantage is that its model training and prediction times are very fast for the amount of data it can handle.
