I want to provide some insight to you and I as to why commiting suicide is more common in countries compared to their geographic/regional counterpart. \n\nI am no anthropologist, sociologist, psychologist, or economist. However, I have a sense of duty of telling a story with data. All statements and analysis are based on my opinion. \n\nUnpacking suicide data needs to be done carefully. Reasons for commiting suicide are not black and white - it's a combination of the following reasons:\n* Lack of food security\n* Lack of affordable housing \n* Lack of suicide prevention courses in youth\n* Lack of affordable healthcare\n* The stigma of mental illness\n* Lack of community acitivity\n* The lack of mental health care\n* Financial insecurity \n* Lack of policies that protect marginalized groups\n\nThis dataset unfortunately does not have all of the above information in order to paint an accurate picture; however, I will continue to build upon this notebook with more datasets that will complement this dataset. \n\nThank you for reading!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Disclaimer**: I made sure to be conscious of what it means to have a reported suicide. I recognize that there could be many developing countries who do not record all of their suicide rates/do not have the resources to do so. This might prevent us from realizing that there could be countries who need recognition when conducting similar analytics.\n\nIn addition, it is not my say to define a silverlining in these situations. Every single reported suicide has a story - untold or not. I do not attempt to make light of these numbers. This kernel is used for research purposes only. I will gladly participate in a discussion that discusses mental health in a deeper manner.
