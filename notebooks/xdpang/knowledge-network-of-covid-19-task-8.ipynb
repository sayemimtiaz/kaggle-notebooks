The knowledge we will extract is represented as relationships between terms related to the topic of interest. The extracted knowledge can be visualized as an interactive network so that researchers can quickly explore and grasp existing knowledge by navigating in the network. Advanced knowledge discovery tools can be built on top of this framework, which will be explored in the next phase of the project.\n\nThe input to the pipeline is a set of keywords, called keywords of interest (KOI); the output of the pipeline is a set of relationships among terms related to the KOI, directly or indirectly, where each relationship is associated with a sentence from which the relationship was extracted from. The interactive network allows users to quickly see the related terms, their relationships, the corresponding sentences from which relationships were extracted, and the articles containing the sentences. Without reading a large number of articles, which can be very time-consuming, a user can quickly grasp the key knowledge related to the KOI using this tool.\n\nOur pipeline consists of two modules: document retrieval and information extraction. In the first module, we first use KOI to retrieve a set of relevant papers containing the KOI. In addition to this standard approach, we have developed a deep learning based method to retrieve additional papers that do not contain KOI, but are still relevant to KOI.\n\nTo build a model that is able to retrieve articles that are relevant to KOI, but do not contain KOI, we need to generate quality training data. The true cases were obtained by querying PubMed using KOI and then removing KOI from the returned articles. The rationale is that even by removing KOI from an article, by reading the rest of the words from the article, a knowledgeable researcher can still judge that the article is relevant to the KOI. We have manually tested this assumption and found that it was quite reasonable. The negative cases were obtained by sampling PubMed articles randomly and making sure that returned articles do not contain KOI. We trained the deep learning model using standard word embedding and BERT model. The model trained using this data was designed to learn the pattern in the articles that are relevant to KOI, but do not contain KOI. When we apply the model to articles that do not contain KOI, it will rank them according to how they are related to KOI. The model achieved satisfactory accuracy in the training dataset. We have manually read some of the top articles retrieved from CORD-19, and found many of them are indeed relevant to the KOI.\n\nTo extract relationships relevant to KOI, we first extracted all the terms in relevant articles and consider two terms as related if they co-occur in the same sentence. Other more sophisticated approaches can be used (i.e. some of our previous relationship extraction studies). These relationships contain some trivial ones, which we would like to remove. To that end, we queried a large number of PubMed articles from PubMed using its API using the same KOI, but not related to COVID-19. We extracted relationships using the same co-occurrence approach and subtracted frequently occurring background relationships (they are likely the trivial ones we want to remove) from those obtained from COVID-19 articles retrieved in the first module. We further extracted terms that co-occur with KOI in the same sentences and allow users to select these terms in the network. These terms and the relationships involving them are likely more relevant to KOI. \n\nBelow we will first show the images of the interactive networks, which are followed by our pipeline and some intermediate results."},{"metadata":{"id":"wrfj93Mwz_2B"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## How to cite the work?\n```\n@inproceedings{The knowledge network of COVID-19 through text mining of

We hypothesized that an assessment of the adaptive immune system, using CD4(+) T-lymphocyte transcriptomics, would identify gene expression correlates of disease severity. METHODS: Infants infected with RSV representing extremes of clinical severity were studied. Mild illness (n = 23) was defined as a ***respiratory rate (RR) < 55 and room air oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) ≥ 97%***, and severe illness (n = 23) was defined as RR ≥ 65 and SaO2 ≤ 92%. RNA from fresh, sort-purified CD4(+) T cells was assessed by RNA sequencing. RESULTS: ***Gestational age, age at illness onset, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, bacterial colonization, and breastfeeding*** were associated (adjusted P < .05) with disease severity. RNA sequencing analysis reliably measured approximately 60% of the genome. Severity of RSV illness had the greatest effect size upon CD4 T-cell gene expression. Pathway analysis identified correlates of severity, including JAK/STAT, prolactin, and interleukin 9 signaling. We also identified genes and pathways associated with timing of symptoms and RSV group (A/B). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest fundamental changes in adaptive immune cell phenotypes may be associated with RSV clinical severity.\n    - ***Analysis:*** This paper talks about the risk factors of disease severity during primary Respiratory Syncytial Virus(RSV) infection. Risk factors include: gestational age, age at illness onset, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, bacterial colonization, and breastfeeding. It is obvious that this pape is a positive case and the prediction score is also high. \n    \n2. ***Article:*** Paper id: 1aluscl8, Prediction Score: 0.986705\n    - ***Title:*** Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern; a Review Article\n    - ***Abstract:*** Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) was first reported in 1976 with two concurrent outbreaks of acute viral hemorrhagic fever centered in Yambuku (near the Ebola river), Democratic Republic of Congo, and in Nzara, Sudan. The current outbreak of the Ebola virus was started by reporting the first case in March 2014 in the forest regions of southeastern Guinea. Due to infection rates raising over 13,000% within a 6-month period, Ebola is now considered as a global public health emergency and on August 8(th), 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. With more than 5000 involved cases and nearly 3000 deaths, this event has turned into the largest and most dangerous Ebola virus outbreak in the world. Based on the above-mentioned, the present article aimed to review the ***virologic characteristics, transmission, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Ebola virus disease.***\n    - ***Analysis:*** This paper pays attention to the disease Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF). Since it is aimed to review the virologic characteristics, transmission, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, we can induce that the the paper will talk about risk factors of this disease.\n\n3. ***Article:*** Paper id: t02jngq0, Prediction Score: 0.98595\n    - ***Title:*** A database of geopositioned Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus occurrences\n    - ***Abstract:*** As a World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint priority pathogen, there is a need to better understand the ***geographic distribution of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and its potential to infect mammals and humans.*** This database documents cases of MERS-CoV globally, with specific attention paid to zoonotic transmission. An initial literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus; after screening articles according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 208 sources were selected for extraction and geo-positioning. Each MERS-CoV occurrence was assigned one of the following classifications based upon published contextual information: index, unspecified, secondary, mammal, environmental, or imported. In total, this database is comprised of 861 unique geo-positioned MERS-CoV occurrences. The purpose of this article is to share a collated MERS-CoV database and extraction protocol that can be utilized in future mapping efforts for both MERS-CoV and other infectious diseases. More broadly, it may also provide useful data for the development of targeted MERS-CoV surveillance, which would prove invaluable in preventing future ***zoonotic spillover***.\n    - ***Analysis:*** This paper aims to analyze specific risk factors of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus((MERS-CoV)). Geographic distribution and potential to infect mammals and humans are two main aspects that the authors concerned about. Through the study of the database, the readers can know how these two factors impact the spread of (MERS-CoV).\n\n4. ***Article:*** Paper id: 9t5ncsig, Prediction Score: 0.985887\n    - ***Title:*** Optimising Renewal Models for Real-Time Epidemic Prediction and Estimation\n    - ***Abstract:*** The effective reproduction number, ***Rt, is an important prognostic for infectious disease epidemics. Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about new transmissions or predict the efficacy of interventions.*** The renewal model infers Rt from incidence data and has been applied to Ebola virus disease and pandemic influenza outbreaks, among others. This model estimates Rt using a sliding window of length k. While this facilitates real-time detection of statistically significant Rt fluctuations, inference is highly k -sensitive. Models with too large or small k might ignore meaningful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones. No principled k -selection scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the accumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory. We derive exact incidence prediction distributions and integrate these within an APE framework to identify the k best supported by available data. We find that this k optimises short-term prediction accuracy and expose how common, heuristic k -choices, which seem sensible, could be misleading.\n    - ***Analysis:*** This article summarizes a study about the renewal model that infers effective reproduction number, Rt, of Ebola virus disease and pandemic influenza outbreak. The effective reproduction number is a basic characteristic of pandemic disease, and is also an important risk factor to the spread of a pandemic. From this study, the readers can know how Rt impact the spread of Ebola virus disease and pandemic influenza. Therefore it may shed light to the control and prevention of such disease.\n\n5. ***Article:*** Paper id: 5zcydnre, Prediction Score: 0.984713\n    - ***Title:*** The time-series ***ages distribution*** of the reported COVID-2019 infected people suggests the undetected ***local spreading*** of COVID-2019 in Hubei and Guangdong provinces before 19th Jan 2020\n    - ***Abstract:*** COVID-2019 is broken out in China. It becomes a severe public health disaster in one month. Find the period in which the spreading of COVID-2019 was overlooked, and understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 in the period will provide valuable information for the countries facing the threats of COVID-2019. The most extensive epidemiological analysis of COVID-2019 ***shows that older people have lower infection rates compared to middle-aged persons***. Common sense is that older people prefer to report their illness and get treatment from the hospital compared to middle-aged persons. ***We propose a hypothesis that when the spreading of COVID-2019 was overlooked, we will find more older cases than the middle-aged cases.*** At first, we tested the hypothesis with 4597 COVID-2019 infected samples reported from 26th Nov 2019 to 17th Feb 2020 across the mainland of China. We found that 19th Jan 2020 is a critical time point. Few samples were reported before that day, and most of them were older ones. Then samples were explosively increased after that day, and many of them were middle-aged people. We have demonstrated the hypothesis to this step. Then, we grouped samples by their residences(provinces). We found that, in the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong, the ages of samples reported before 19th Jan 2020 are significantly higher than the ages of samples reported after that day. It suggests the COVID-2019 may be spreading in Hubei and Guangdong provinces before 19th Jan 2020 while people were unconscious of it. At last, we proposed that ***the ages distribution*** of each-day-reported samples could serve as a ***warning indicator*** of whether all potential COVID-2019 infected people are found. We think the power of our analysis is limit because 1. the work is data-driven, and 2. only ~5% of the COVID-2019 infected people in China are included in the study. However, we believe it still shows some value for its ability to estimate the possible unfound COVID-2019 infected people.\n    - ***Analysis:*** This article summarizes a study on COVID-19 infected people in Hubei and Guangdong provinces of China. We can see that the main focus of this study is the distribution of age group of patients. Age is a key risk factor related to COVID-19. Specifically, the article points out that age distribution can serve as a warning indicator of whether all potentially infected people are all found. This will shed light to treating patients better and slowing down the spread of disease.\n\nIn conclusion, we see from the above examples that these articles are indeed relevant to risk factors to the outbreak, spread, infection, or mortality of a disease in some way, and to some degree, although the direct keyword \"risk\" and \"factor\" have never occurred in these articles.  \n"},{"metadata":{"id":"mN68AyG_z_37"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Information extraction\n\nIn information extraction, we extract interesting relationships in the relevant articles to build an interactive network through which researchers can navigate the existing knowledge about COVID-19 on the topic defined by KOI.\nA function was developed to extract relationships (edges) between a pair of concepts.

An edge was constructed for each pair of words in the sentence. The words and edges from all the sentences then form a network. This network contains many trivial edges. For example, if \"protein interaction network\" is in the sentence and they are treated as three separate words, then there will be three edges between any pair of the two words.
