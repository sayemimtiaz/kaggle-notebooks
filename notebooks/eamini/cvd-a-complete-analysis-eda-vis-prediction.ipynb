This has raised many concerns and research to find ways to prevent CVD among people. While it is said that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable, it is difficult to predict and prevent this disease because it involves many risk factors such as sex, family history, smoking and many more. Data analysis and machine learning methods seem to be a reliable way to explore the patients’ data, identify risk factors, and predict if a person is likely to have CVD or not. I chose this subject due to its importance, and the integral role of data analysis methods to solve it. I am going to explore the following questions:\n\n1.\tHow each of the variables (risk factors) affect having CVD? For instance, can we say cholesterol level contributes to CVD? What about smoking?\n2.\tHow we can compare the distribution of different risk factors among people with and without CVD? What kind of distributions they are?\n3.\tWhat is the correlation between variables? Can we expect any relationship? Can we expect a value for the person’s blood pressure when we know his/her age?\n4.\tBased on a person’s health profile, can we predict if a person is likely to have CVD?\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Table of Contents"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Filter all warnings.\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas.util.testing as tm\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport sklearn.naive_bayes as sknb\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def multiplePlots( series ):\n    \n    fig, axs = plt.subplots(2,2)\n    plt.tight_layout(pad=0.4, w_pad=4, h_pad=1.0)\n    #plt.annotate(name, xy =(0,0))\n    # Histogram\n    sns.distplot(series, ax=axs[0,0])\n    \n    \n    # Lag plot\n    lag = series.copy()\n    lag = np.array(lag[:-1])\n    current = series[1:]\n    ax = sns.regplot(current,lag,fit_reg=False, ax=axs[0,1])\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"y_i-1\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"y_i\")\n    \n    # QQ plot\n    qntls, xr = stats.probplot(series, fit=False)\n    sns.regplot(xr,qntls, ax=axs[1,0])\n    \n    # Run sequence\n    ax = sns.regplot(np.arange(len(series)),series, ax=axs[1,1])\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"val\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"i\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load Data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/cardio_train.csv\",sep=\";\")\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/cardio_train.csv\",sep=\";\")\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"The shape of the dataset is: {df.shape}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👩🏻‍💻 \n -

I changed hyperparameters and used cross-validation to tune the models.\nIn selecting the model, since we are dealing with disease, it is important to minimize the errors in prediction, but most importantly minimize false-negative predictions. The reason is that, if we predict a person not having CVD, while the person has, we are jeopardizing the person’s health. Since the dataset is balanced, I can consider f-1 score as well; however, due to the impotence of minimizing false negative prediction, I prefer recall score.
