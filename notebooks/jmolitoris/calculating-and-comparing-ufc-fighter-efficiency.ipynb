Fighter efficiency can be thought of as the percentage of a fighter's attacks that are successful, and these will include attacks of all types (i.e. standing up, on the ground, in the clinch, and takedowns). The problem is, if we only calculate fighter efficiency as the sum of attacks of all types divided by the sum of attempts of all types, we won't be able to easily compare these across fighters. That is because different fighters have different fighting styles. Some of them rely more on takedowns and ground and pound, which tend tend to have relatively higher success rates, while others rely more on standup attacks, which have lower success rates, but higher volume. So, the goal here is to put forward a measure that can be used to standardize for this fact."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Getting Started  \nFirst, let's import the relevant libraries and the raw UFC data."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nraw_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/ufcdata/raw_total_fight_data.csv\", sep = \";\")\nraw_data.head()\n# Create a copy to work with\ndf = raw_data.copy()\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Turning the wide dataframe of fights into a long dataframe of fighters\nWe see that the dataframe is in a wide format grouped by each fight, with the Red and Blue corner fighters having their fight stats in columns denoted by 'R_' and 'B_', respectively.

For distance strikes, fighters who attempt a greater proportion of their attacks from range tend to also be less efficient. There is a fairly strong negative correlation ($\\rho$ = -0.53) between the proporiton of distance strikes and total efficiency.

Basically, I wanted to see if champions are more efficient versus the rest of their division and if this is related to the weight they fight at. The challenge here, is that women have fewer weight classes, with the top weight class being Featherweight. So even though featherweight is one of the smaller weight classes for men, it is the heaviest for women.  So I reconstructed a new relative weight class measure that takes gender into account, so that I can get an idea when comparing ALL fighters, how the gap between champions and the rest of the weight class varies according to weight.  \n\nThe results were pretty interesting. It seems that the heavier the weight class, the larger the efficiency gap is between the champions and the rest.  For the smaller divisions (flyweight, bantamweight, and featherweight) there is basically no difference in the adjuste efficiency of the champions and median fighter. But when we get up to Light Heavyweight, we see that Jon Jones is almost 30% more efficient than the median of the division. This might be because of the inherent differences in conditioning between the weight classes.  Typically, the heavier fighters are more powerful, but have less stamina than lighter fighters. In that case, there is a premium to being highly efficient.  For the lighter weight classes, higher stamina allows even good fighters the opportunity to be less efficient but to have a higher output. And we can expect that the opponents of the champions in the smaller weight classes may also be more mobile (and therefore harder to land on), which could play a role in these numbers too.

I was surprised to see that fighter efficiency depended so much on fighters' styles and that the importance of adjusted efficiency seems to be greater for heavier fighters than for smaller ones.  With this simple metric it is easy to compare fighters from different eras, genders, weightclasses, and styles. Even though efficiency clearly isn't everything, it is a fun talking point when chatting with your friends about who is a better fighter.  :-P"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
