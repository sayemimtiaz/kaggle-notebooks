The documentation doesnt really explain what this means. Next, an individual's having household insurance is predictive of purchasing car insurance, which is intuitive. We would expect that risk-averse individuals would be more likely to buy both, and riskier individuals to have neither. Interestingly, our constructed feature `CallDur`, which was the length of the sales call in minutes, strongly influenced the predictive capacity of the model. There may be two reasons for this. First, longer call durations could be correlated with a salesman's ability, thereby leading to higher sales. Second, individuals who were already likely to buy insurance for other reasons may need to have longer calls in order to fill out documentation, etc. So, this is not necessarilly a causal relationship, but the two are correlated nonetheless. Communication via phone or cellphone were also importance determinants, but one has to keep in mind that the reference category was 'missing', so it is really not clear what the interpretation of these importances are without figuring out what the missing communication types were."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Going Forward\nIn the future, I would like to experiment more with the pipeline here. It could be interesting to do a bit more feature engineering, especially with regard to the functional forms of the continuous features in the model.

After all, young people may not buy their own insurance and older people may no longer drive, so we would expect that middle-aged individuals would have a higher propensity to purchase car insurance.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
