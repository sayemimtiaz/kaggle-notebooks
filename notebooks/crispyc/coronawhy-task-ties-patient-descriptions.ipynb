The mechanism is simple. It indexes all articles in the CORD-19 collection with its embedding (i.e. mathematical representation of an article) and conducts a k-nearest neighbor search to discover similar articles. For each seed article, we identify a set of candidates, but only those that surface at least twice across all searches are considered as potential additions to the summary table. In addition, we use the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) library, which is optimized to perform similarity search in dense vector spaces, to ensure the search remains efficient as the literature body expands.\n\nOnce we gather our list of candidate articles, we apply a suite of AI-powered utility tools trained with supervised learning methods to construct the summary tables. Functionality wise, we have focused on two types of tools: one extracts information that is fundamental to all literature reviews such as study design and sample size, and the other extracts a range of information with shared characteristics. For instance, age, incubation period, and duration of viral shedding are essentially different kinds of time periods and thus can be extracted using the same tool with minimum filtering. While like most supervised approaches, collecting the training datasets can be expensive and labor-intensive, the trained models have great generalizability and can be easily modified and reused in other contexts.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a>\n## Results\nWe present the summary tables created by this notebook in PowerBI reports. \n\n[Link to view the reports in full screen](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzU2YTk5ZjMtODU5My00ZjgyLWFmMWEtZDE4NzRjNzJhZTg1IiwidCI6ImRjMWYwNGY1LWMxZTUtNDQyOS1hODEyLTU3OTNiZTQ1YmY5ZCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D)\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame('https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzVjZmJkM2UtYzdhMi00NGQ2LWEwZTYtYjZjNjU4OTc0MDI3IiwidCI6ImRjMWYwNGY1LWMxZTUtNDQyOS1hODEyLTU3OTNiZTQ1YmY5ZCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D', width=\"100%\", height=500)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"3\"></a>\n## Code\n\nBelow we present the annotated code to reproduce the summary tables.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Set up\n\nWe will use cord_19_embeddings to perform similarity search and then retrieve articles' metadata from metadata.csv.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install faiss-cpu --no-cache -q\n# !pip install faiss\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport glob\nimport faiss\nfrom faiss import normalize_L2\nimport collections\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport re\nfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def setup_local_data():\n    input_dir = '/kaggle/input/'\n    for item in glob.glob(os.path.join(input_dir,'*')):\n        print(item)\n    return input_dir\n\ndef read_metadata(input_dir):\n    metadata = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(input_dir,'CORD-19-research-challenge','metadata.csv'))\n    print(metadata.info())\n    return metadata\n\ndef read_cord_19_embeddings(input_dir):                                      \n    emb_path = glob.glob(os.path.join(input_dir,'CORD-19-research-challenge', 'cord_19_embeddings', ''.join(('cord_19_embeddings_2020-07-27.csv'))))#[0]\n    print('input_dir: ', input_dir)\n    print('emb_path: ', emb_path)\n    emb = pd.read_csv(emb_path[0], header = None, index_col = 0)\n    print(emb.head())\n    return emb\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fetching cord_uids of the seed articles by matching article titles\ndef get_ref_cord_uid(target_table, metadata):\n    titles = target_table['Study'].unique().tolist()\n    cord_uids = metadata[metadata['title'].isin(titles)]['cord_uid'].tolist()\n    return cord_uids\n    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"local_dir = setup_local_data()\nmetadata = read_metadata(local_dir)\nemb = read_cord_19_embeddings(local_dir)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Creating faiss search index\nWe index all the articles with their embeddings in a dense vector space.

We also secured paragraph-level data (to allow annotators an improved sense of linguistic context), though the data turned out to be far less useful than the sentence-level annotations. Annotations were then fed into SpaCy for the development of a custom NER model from a blank slate. The model training utilized a compounding mini-batch size (from 2 to 16) and a decaying dropout rate (from 0.6 to 0.2).\n\nWe planned on using this model to extract sample size data, but due to time constraint, we have not gathered sufficient training data. Therefore, the data extraction is temporarily based on rule-base matching. We first removed dates from the text as we have found that dates often contaminate our extracted output. We also converted all numbers written in words back to numerical format. Lastly, we used a set of keywords that are commonly used in describing sample size in the abstracts (the reason that we used abstracts was that they tend to be more concise and thus have less noise around the target information) to narrow down the extraction scope and extracted the target data.
