You can combine them and implement the model and compare the results (you will probably get a higher accuracy since similar classes are merged into one, which are the ones our model will often get wrong), but here I have kept them separate.\n\nThat issue aside, we have a big problem here that is clearly shown by the count plot. There are way too many headlines classified as news (and to some extent, sports and business), compared to the others. \n\n**Why is this a problem?**\n\nWell, suppose we want to predict the class without knowing any data -- the chance is 1/21 i.e. 4.76%. Pretty low. Your model can predict a random class and it'll only get 4.76% accuracy.\n\nNow, suppose we feed this data to our model with a validation test that is also so skewed. Most of the models will start to predict news or sports or business on every headline. \nWhy is that? For that, let's see how much % of our headlines is 'news'. According to the csv, we have 1.43 million rows. And from the above value_counts, we have found that news corresponds to 574774 of headlines. \n\n574774/1430000 = 40.19%\nSo even if the model were to predict that every single headline belongs to the 'news' category, it would have 40.19% accuracy. Now, if it learns the difference between only the major 3 categories -- 'news', 'sports' and 'business', it can reach about 60% accuracy.\n\nWhat this means is that our model potentially won't learn anything about other classes and if that happens, it will not be able to classify the less frequent categories.

For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks. \n\nMost of machine learning models are very specific. They are very good at handling one problem, and only that one problem. Transfer learning allows us to use the knowledge that a model has learned in domain A (suppose cars) in training a model for a similar problem in domain B (suppose trucks).\n\nWhat we essentially do is take a pretrained model that was used for a task T1 in certain domain A, and fine tune it to use it on a similar task T2 in domain B.\n\nfast ai features ULMFiT (Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification) which as the name suggests, is a universal language model for text classification.

For example, \"I need a hotdog now\" vs \"I NEED a hotdog now\". The second one implies more urgency, more hunger than the first. However, to have less features and reduce complexity, since all text is converted to lower case, both of them end up as \"i need a hotdog now\", in which we have definitely lost some understanding after tokenization. \"China\" is a country, \"china\" is porcelain. So you can see, proper tokenization is a very important prequisite for language modelling.\n\nUsing xx tokens we retain a lot of the original meaning despite converting everything to lowercase.\nHere are all of the xx tokens and what they mean - \n\n1. xxbos = Beggining Of Sentence = This xx token represents the beggining of a sentence.\n\n2. xxpad = Padding = Used for padding if needed to regroup several texts of different lengths into one batch.\n\n3. xxmaj = Denotes that the following word begins with uppercase. So \"Hello World\" becomes \"xxbos xxmaj hello xxmaj world\"\n\n4. xxfld = Separates different fields of text (when we have more than one column in dataframe for text classification, for eg, if we had both headlines and article text in two seperate columns, we would have 2 fields).\n\n5. xxup = Denotes that the following word is entirely uppercase. \"... NEED... \" becomes \"...xxup need...\"\n\n6. xxrep = Repetitions = Denotes how many times a CHARACTER has been repeated consecutively, if it has been repeated consecutively. \"...oooo ...\" becomes \"...xxrep 4 o ...\"\n\n7. xxwrep = Same thing as xxrep but for words. \"...muda muda muda muda muda...\" becomes \"...xxwrep 5 muda...\"\n\n8. xxunk = Denotes an unknown word, that is not in our vocabulary.

we use another parameter, moms, which is another parameter that Leslie Smith advices to use. It stands for momentum. Since I'm picking an aggressive learning rate here, the momentum will help slow down the overshoot if there is any. \n\nIntuitively, we want to have\n\n1) a higher momentum with a low learning rate\n\n2) a low momentum with a high learning rate\n\n> To accompany the movement toward larger learning rates, Leslie found in his experiments that decreasing the momentum led to better results. This supports the intuition that in that part of the training, we want the SGD to quickly go in new directions to find a flatter area, so the new gradients need to be given more weight. In practice, he recommends to pick two values likes 0.85 and 0.95, and decrease from the higher one to the lower one when we increase the learning rate, then go back to the higher momentum as the learning rate goes down.\n\nCited from [Sylvain Gugger's post](https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html) "},{"metadata":{"id":"Zvqkz45mNsZ2","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clas.fit_one_cycle(5, 5e-04, moms=(0.9,0.8))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Save the encoder for the classifier so we don't have to train next time.
