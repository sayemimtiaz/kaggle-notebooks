They are used to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form. Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow.\n\nRecommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Recommender systems can be classified into Two types:\n\n> **Content-based recommenders**: suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. And to recommend that, it will make use of the user's past item metadata. A good example could be YouTube, where based on your history, it suggests you new videos that you could potentially watch.\n\n> **Collaborative filtering engines**: these systems are widely used, and they try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of other users. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here we are going to implement **Content Based Filtering**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import Pandas\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Loading Data sets\nfull_url='/kaggle/input/tmdb-movie-metadata/tmdb_5000_credits.csv'\n\nfull_url1='/kaggle/input/tmdb-movie-metadata/tmdb_5000_movies.csv'\n\ncredits = pd.read_csv(full_url)\nmovies=pd.read_csv(full_url1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Printing 1st 5 elements of credits dataset\ncredits.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Printing 1st 5 elements of movies dataset\nmovies.head(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Printing the shapes of both the datasets\nprint(\"Credits:\",credits.shape)\nprint(\"Movies:\",movies.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Renaming the column of credits data set\ncredits_renamed=credits.rename(index=str,columns={'movie_id':'id'})\ncredits_renamed.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Merging both data sets\nmerge=movies.merge(credits_renamed,on='id')\nmerge.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Dropping unnecessary columns \ncleaned=merge.drop(columns=['homepage','title_x','title_y','status','production_countries'])\ncleaned.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cleaned['overview'].head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import TfIdfVectorizer from scikit-learn\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\n#Define a TF-IDF Vectorizer Object.
