Prepare functions for training and optimisation\n\nSome functions worth calling out:\n\n- **define_model** - This is where we define the architecture of our CNN. I've decided to stick to a fairly simple one in order to limit computational resources required.\n\n- **evaluate_model_cross_validation** - This is for running k-fold cross validation. We take the training data, shuffle it, and split it into k groups. We train a new model on k-1 groups, and validate it on the remaining group. We do this k times (starting with freshly initialized model weights each time), giving each group a chance to be the validation group. Then we take an average over the validation accuracies of each trial to get an estimate for the performance of the model/training parameters.\n\n- **grid_search** - We trial a preset selection of hyperparameter combinations, evaluating the performance of the model with each run. This lets us get a coarse map of model performance over hyperparameter space. In the interest of saving time and resources we only do single evaluations of the model at each selected point in hyperparameter space. Although given more time and resources, we could do k-fold cross validation.\n\n- **selecive_search** - We run either Random Search, or Bayesian Optimisation over a selected range of hyperparameters. \n  - Random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameters in the given range and trialling them. \n  - Bayesian Optimisation on the other hand, uses knowledge of the performance of previous trials to construct probabilisitic surrogate functions for the real objective function (or put simply - it guesses the relationship between hyperparameter choice and model perormance). It then uses this knowledge to make a best guess for which hyperparameters to choose next."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#### CUSTOM CALLBACK\n\nclass PlotProgress(Callback):\n    def on_train_begin(self, logs={}):\n        self.fig, self.ax1, self.ax2 = self.prepare_plot()\n        self.loss_history = list()\n        self.val_loss_history = list()\n        self.accuracy_history = list()\n        self.val_accuracy_history = list()\n        \n    #

We'll stick with a batch size of 32 while searching over learning rate and momentum. \n\nWe'll also need to apply 5-fold cross-validation to drown out the noise.

Note that even though in some regimes it looks like our minimum might fall outside of the grid search range, I've checked those areas offline and found that the score got worse.\n\nWhat explains the shifting of the minimum as momentum changes you might ask? In a stable configuration, momentum tends to accelerate the convergence towards a minimum, therefore allowing for smaller learning rates to be used.

Bayesian optimisation\n\nNow let's try running Bayesian optimisation . We can make observations about each chart produced below:\n\n1. **Score over iterations** and 2. **Running best score over iterations**\n\n  - We do observe a trend towards better accuracy as seen by the fitted line. This is probably less because the minimum is improving, and more because the algorithm spends less time evaluating hyperparameters which are clearly not candidates for optimal performance.\n  \n  \n3. **Learning rate over iterations** and 4. **the corresponding box and whisker plots**\n  - A strange thing we see here is convergence and divergence of the trialled hyperparameters. My guess is because the noise from the statistical deviations are not allowing the algorithm to map out the terrain reliably. It can't settle on a minimum because each time it tests a certain set of hyperparameters it gets a slightly different answer.\n  - Nevertheless we do see hints that the algorithm restricts its search space to a narrower neighborhood than the full range, as expected.\n  \n  \n5. **Momentum over iterations** and 6. **the corresponding box and whisker plots**\n  - Here we make similar observations to the learning rates. What's interesting, is the way the average tends to converge and diverge with the learning rate. Remember I mentioned earlier that as momentum increases, we need to decrease learning rate to maintain good model training performance. So there is somehow a coupling between momentum and learning rate if we try to maintain good performance. This is what the optimisation algorithm is demonstrating for us here!"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"with open('../input/hyperparameter-optimisation-on-a-cnn/bayesian_scores.pickle', 'rb') as file:\n    bo_histories = pickle.load(file) \nwith open('../input/hyperparameter-optimisation-on-a-cnn/bayesian_hpsets.pickle', 'rb') as file:\n    bo_hpsets = pickle.load(file)\n\nplot_selective_search_results(bo_histories, bo_hpsets)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 8. Final remarks about hyperoptimisation (in this specific use case)\n\nAlthough we were able to demonstrate Bayesain Optimisation in action, the results are far from inspiring. The chart below shows us the running best scores from each of the methods. Bayesian optimisation gets the best results but only beats random search by 0.04% in accuracy. Our course grid seach got 97.8% accuracy in 30 iterations whereas it took Bayesian Optmisation 500 trials to get 97.9% accuracy.\n\nIt's definitely worth noting that the statistical noise may have spoiled the ability of Bayesian Optimisation to do its job.\n\nIn any case, for the practical purposes of this example, it would have been suffiecient to run grid search and Bayesian Optimisation for say 100 iterations each to get a decent idea of how the model might peform."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"with open('../input/hyperparameter-optimisation-on-a-cnn/grid_scores.pickle', 'rb') as file:\n    grid_scores = pickle.load(file)\nwith open('../input/hyperparameter-optimisation-on-a-cnn/grid_hpsets.pickle', 'rb') as file:\n    grid_hpsets = pickle.load(file)  \nwith open('../input/hyperparameter-optimisation-on-a-cnn/random_scores.pickle', 'rb') as file:\n    rand_scores = pickle.load(file)\nwith open('../input/hyperparameter-optimisation-on-a-cnn/random_hpsets.pickle', 'rb') as file:\n    rand_hpsets = pickle.load(file)\nwith open('../input/hyperparameter-optimisation-on-a-cnn/bayesian_scores.pickle', 'rb') as file:\n    bayesian_scores = pickle.load(file) \nwith open('../input/hyperparameter-optimisation-on-a-cnn/bayesian_hpsets.pickle', 'rb') as file:\n    bayesian_hpsets = pickle.load(file) \n\nprint('Grid best', grid_hpsets[np.argsort(grid_scores)[0]])\nprint('Random best', rand_hpsets[np.argsort(rand_scores)[0]])\nprint('Bayesian best', bayesian_hpsets[np.argsort(bayesian_scores)[0]])\n    \nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(9.5,4))\nax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\nax.plot(range(len(rand_scores)), np.minimum.accumulate(rand_scores), 'r.')\nax.plot(range(len(bayesian_scores)), np.minimum.accumulate(bayesian_scores), 'b.')\nax.plot(range(len(grid_scores)), np.minimum.accumulate(grid_scores), 'g.')\nax.set_title('Running best scores of each method of hyperparameter optimisation')\nax.set_ylabel('log10(1 - val_accuracy)')\nax.set_xlabel('# iteration')\nax.legend(['random search', 'bayesian optimization', 'grid_search'])\nax.set_ylim(-1.7, -1.6)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
