For a more applicable snapshot, I filtered the data to include only the following:\n\n* **Only include the first two games within a best of 3 Series.**\n\nMatches are most often played as best of 1's, or best of 3's. For this analysis, I will only focus on best of 3's, as most analysts generally look at pick/ban in terms of a best of 3 series. Additionally, there is generally no \"pick\" in a best of 1 as the common methodology is for both teams to ban 3 maps until there is a surviving map to play.\n\n* **Only include games between two teams within the top 20 (at the time the game was played).**\n\nThe scene is generally focused around the top twenty, and the pick/ban phase is considered quite important at this level. Imposing this filter also removes wins that top teams gain by farming weaker teams not near their skill level. \n\n* **Remove teams which did not pick more than 20 games**\n\nThis filter gives some strength to the analysis such that teams with only a few map picks do not generate outlier win/loss percentages.  \n\n* **Only Include games after 12/31/2016**\n\nI added this filter as I wanted to create a time-span of data of about 2 years. I felt this time span was large enough to gain a good snapshot, but still small enough that it hopefully curbs part of the issue generating from player changes within a team (see disclaimer at the bottom)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Python Code**\n\nThe below python code cleans up the data and generates a final table that with three columns:\n\n* Team Name\n* Win Percentage on Picked Maps\n* Number of Games Played"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"d_picks.rename(columns={\"team_1\":\"team_1_pick\",\"team_2\":\"team_2_pick\" }, inplace=True)\n\nnew_df = pd.merge(d_results, d_picks, left_on=\"match_id\", right_on=\"match_id\")\n\n#filter for best of 3's\nnew_df = new_df[new_df[\"best_of\"] == \"3\"]\n\n#add new column for winning team name\nnew_df[\"winning_team_name\"] = \"\"\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"map_winner\"]==1, \"winning_team_name\"] = new_df[\"team_1\"]\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"map_winner\"]==2, \"winning_team_name\"] = new_df[\"team_2\"]\n\n#create column for name of team who picked the map\nnew_df[\"map_picker\"] = \"\"\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"_map\"] == new_df[\"t1_picked_1\"], \"map_picker\"] = new_df[\"team_1_pick\"]\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"_map\"] == new_df[\"t2_picked_1\"], \"map_picker\"] = new_df[\"team_2_pick\"]\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"_map\"] == new_df[\"left_over\"], \"map_picker\"] = \"left_over\"\n\n#remove decider games\nnew_df = new_df[new_df[\"map_picker\"] != \"left_over\"]\n\n#create column for pick win\nnew_df[\"pick_win\"] = new_df[\"winning_team_name\"] == new_df[\"map_picker\"]\n\n#create column for rank of winning team\nnew_df[\"winning_rank\"] = 0\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"map_winner\"]==1, \"winning_rank\"] = new_df[\"rank_1\"]\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"map_winner\"]==2, \"winning_rank\"] = new_df[\"rank_2\"]\n\n#create column for rank of losing team\nnew_df[\"losing_rank\"] = 0\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"map_winner\"]==1, \"losing_rank\"] = new_df[\"rank_2\"]\nnew_df.loc[new_df[\"map_winner\"]==2, \"losing_rank\"] = new_df[\"rank_1\"]\n\n#filter for only teams in the top twenty\nnew_df = new_df[new_df['winning_rank']< 21]\nnew_df = new_df[new_df['losing_rank']< 21]\n\n#filter for after a certain date\nnew_df['date_x'] = pd.to_datetime(new_df['date_x'])\nnew_df = new_df[new_df['date_x'] > \"12-31-2016\"]\n\n#groupby team\ngrouper = new_df.groupby(\"map_picker\")[\"pick_win\"].value_counts(normalize=True)\ngrouper = grouper[grouper.index.isin([True], level=1)]\n\n#Remove redundant index and sort\ngrouper = grouper.reset_index(level=1, drop=True)\ngrouper = grouper.sort_values(ascending = False)\ngrouper = grouper.to_frame()\ngrouper = grouper.reset_index()\n\n#Add column based on number of games\nfilter_series = new_df[\"map_picker\"].value_counts()\nfilter_series = filter_series.to_frame()\nfilter_series = filter_series.reset_index()\ngrouper = pd.merge(grouper, filter_series, left_on=\"map_picker\", right_on=\"index\")\ngrouper = grouper.drop(\"index\", 1)\ngrouper.rename(columns={\"map_picker_x\":\"Team\",\"pick_win\": \"Win Percentage\", \"map_picker_y\":\"Number of Games\" }, inplace=True)\ngrouper = grouper[grouper[\"Number of Games\"] > 20]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(grouper)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Analysis**\n\nThe generated information was quite interesting to me for a number of reasons:\n\n* **Astralis** - It provides just more evidence that Astralis is the best core of all time. Even other strong teams above (FaZe, Liquid, Evil Geniuses) are over 10% below that of Astralis. I imagine this percentage is boosted heavily by their Nuke streak, as well as generally being unbeatible (on any map) in 2018. \n\n* **Ence** - Ence being second feeds into the general narrative that Ence was a good team because of tactics and guile, using aspects such as map pick/ban to gain wins over better teams. It impresses me they were able to have the second highest win percentage on their own pick, while still being so far below the other elite teams in terms of skill. It is also a further indictment of their choice to kick Aleksib. I don't think they could ever have reached this percentage without them. \n\n* **Space Soldiers** - It is interesting that they are so high on the list. I imagine this is a function of farming low top 20 teams online, but I would have to look more into the data to determine the exact cause. \n\n* **General** - It appears to me that while your map pick can generate an increased chance to win a game, you still have to be a quality team in order to execute. Your map pick is by no means a free win, even if you are a tactical team. For example, BIG is second to last, and they are known to follow a strong gameplan. Additionally, neither North nor Optic, which were at times led by MSL with a fairly rigid system, have strong winrates (Optic is even last).  \n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe data used for this project is not perfect as it includes online matches and does not account for player changes within a team. However, I thought this was a fun exercise in data science and a bit illuminating as to the impact of pick/ban.
