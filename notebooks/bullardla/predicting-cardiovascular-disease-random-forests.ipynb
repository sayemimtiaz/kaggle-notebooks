However, the general intution behind a random forest model will be detailed below.\n\nIn short, a random forest model excels because the model utilizes the wisdom of the crowd. Decision trees are frequently cited as having low variance and high bias, and ultimately struggle at a lot of classification tasks due to this shortcoming. By making a prediction based on the classifications of a set of decision trees, however, a random forest overcomes many of the issues that a single decision tree faces. \n\nSo, a random forest can be thought of as a collection of decision trees. However, if each decision tree in the random forest was trained on the same set of data, each decision tree would always make the same prediction, as all of the decision trees would be identical. To prevent this, random forests use a technique known as bagging, which dictates that each decision tree is trained on a subset of the actual training data, but with each subset being the same size as the original training set. This is accomplished by taking a subset of the data, where the subset contains only `X%` of the original dataset, and then random elements from the subset are replicated until the subset is the same size as the original training set. This helps to ensure each decision tree is biased in a certain direction, with the hope being that __each decision tree errs in a unique way, such that the colleciton of the errors cancel each other out__. \n\nTo further ensure the above qualification, each decision tree is also presented only a subset of the original variables present in the training set. Thus, if a random forest model was to predict the age of a person based on their height, weight, and hair color, one decision tree in the model might be trained using only height and weight, while another decision tree might be trained with height and hair color, and so on.\n\nThe hyperparameters accepts by the `BinaryRandomForest` model are used to represent this behavior. The `BinaryRandomForest` has a configurable number of decision trees, `num_trees`, as well as a configurable number of variables each tree is provided with, `tree_dimensionality`. \n\nUsing these variables, a `BinaryRandomForest` model will be trained that's made up of 10 decision trees, with each tree being trained on five variables and each tree having a height of three.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#k_fold_eval_rf(df, 10, 5, 3, 4, verbose=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After training and evaluating a Random Forest with 10 5-dim 3-height trees, the following combined metrics are obtained.\n```\nCombined Metrics:\nConfusion Matrix:\n[[113  25]\n [ 38 127]]\nAccuracy: 0.7920792079207921\nRecalls: [0.8188405797101449, 0.7696969696969697]\nPrecisions: [0.7483443708609272, 0.8355263157894737]\nWeighted F1: 0.7916661488117309\n```\nWith `verbose == True`, the varying biases of the trees can be observed, with several of the decision trees having unique conditional values for the root nodes.

But why? After all, it's ill-advised to try every permutation of hyperparameters, even after making the observation that performance seems to be somewhat correlated with smaller dimesionality and tree heights. What is the intuition behind Random Forests? What makes a Random Forest (typically) achieve much better performance than an individual decision tree? Answers to these questions will provide valuable insight into choosing promising values for the hyperparameters.\n\nA Random Forest typically performs better than a single decision tree due the ensemble of trees offering protection against any individual errors within decision trees. That is, while an individual decision tree may err, either due to overfitting, underfitting, or due to a different shortcoming, a collection of decision trees can be robust to error __if they all err in different ways__. This can be achieved if the decision trees that make up a Random Forest are uncorrelated. A Random Forest where all trees have a similar bias is no better than a single decision tree (consider a Random Forest with 100 decision trees that are all the same - the predictions made by the Random Forest will be identical with those of the single decision tree the Random Forest is comprised of). \n\nOf course, if all the decision trees in a Random Forest are trained on the same dataset, the trees will be identical in structure. Each tree in the forest thus needs to be trained on a subset of the original dataset, which is accomplished through bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and through training each tree on only a subset of the input variables. \n\nThe purpose of bootstrap aggregating, instead of simply subsampling the training set, is to discourage training a model which accurately maps the training set but fails to generalize to the testing set. For this particular dataset, there are only ~300 entries in the combined dataset, while there are ~300,000,000 people in the United State population. This dataset represents only 0.0001% of the United States population, and could thus feature trends that aren't indicative of the larger population. In the entire U.S. population, it may be observed that men and women are at equal risk of heart disease, but a sample size of only 300 may belie this and have all male samples as having heart disease and all female samples as not having heart disease.  For such a subset a decision tree could easily obtain 100% accuracy, but would be expected to only obtain ~50% accuracy when applied to the entire U.S. population. \n\nIn the above scenario, it can be readily understood how sampling a subset of input variables might improve testing accuracy. Any decision tree trained on a group of variables including the `gender` variable will have only a single root node that splits the data by gender and achieves maximum information gain as both subsets will have zero entropy (male subset will all be `heart_disease` and female subset will all be `no_heart_disease`). But a decision tree that wasn't trained on this variable would not err in the same way. Individually, it might achieve worse performance on the training set - and may even cause the entire Random Forest to achieve worse performance on the training set - but it would (hopefully) achieve better performance on the testing set and therefore boost the performance of the Random Forest. This is the intuition behind why a collection of uncorrelated models will often achieve better performance than any of the individual models the collection is comprised of.\n\nBut it still might not be obvious why bagging is used for the training set entries instead of training each decision tree on a different subset of the entries. What is the benefit of selection with replacement versus selection without replacement?\n\nWhile sampling without replacement can lead to an ensemble model with high variance, the theory behind bagging - sampling with replacement - is that such a technique reduces the variance of an ensemble model. Intuitively, by sampling with replacement, a dataset which is a sample distribution from a larger population can be used to create additional sample disributions that also may have plausibly occurred from the sampled population. The input variables in each bagged sample will have slight variations in their distributions, causing each decision tree to be fitted on a different potential sample distribution from the original population.\n\nPerhaps more intuitively, bagging can be viewed as a sampling methood which adds varying weights to different data points. For a training set with the entries `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, a bagged permutation of `[1, 1, 1, 3, 3]` can be thought of as `{1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0}`. By weighting entries differently across decision trees in the Random Forest, the resulting trees will in theory be uncorrelated, each tree erring in a different way such that the sum of the errors cancel out for any given input.\n\nGiven this intuition behind the usefulness of a Random Forest model, a logical starting point for a Random Forest model would be one made up of many decision trees of varying heights and dimensions. But for a Random Forest with only one type of decision tree, what Random Forest model will perform the best? Will the observation of a Random Forest made up of shorter, lower dimensionality decision trees providing the best overall perfomance hold?","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# This takes several days to complete.

At higher dimensionality, the height of trees in a Random Forest is positively correlated with the Weighted F1 score of the model.\n2.

The model with the best overall performance across dimensionalities is the Random Forest with 50 trees, each with a height of three.\n4. The model that achieves the highest Weighted F1 score at any single level of dimensionality is the Random Forest with 10 trees, each with a height of tree (though this may be an outlier).\n\nNone of the observations are particularly surprising, although it's important to highlight that Random Forest models are a lot more robust to overfitting even when their decision trees have heights that lead to significant individual overfitting. Again, the individual errors of tall, overfitting trees will (theoretically) be cancelled out in aggregate, so it's unlikely that performance of the Random Forest will decrease once a certain height is reached despite this being true of a single decison tree model.\n\nThe previous observation that a Random Forest of shorter trees trained on fewer dimensions achieves better performance than a Random Forest with taller, higher dimensionality trees has been disproved with this more thorough testing. Nevertheless, the apparent marginal performance gain of most of the models between dimensionalities of 3 and 13 may not warrant the additional training time required to compile the model, though Random Forests with taller trees seem to benefit more from additional dimensions than those with shorter trees.\n\nA few of the trained models were able to achieve a Weighted F1 score of 85%, 6% higher than the 79% that a single decision tree model was able to achieve.

The maximum obtained Weighted F1 score is still 85%, and further testing makes it unclear whether increasing the number of trees, the heights of the trees, or the number of dimensions each tree is trained on in the Random Forest will improve performance.\n\nAs the intuition behind the Random Forest model can be summed up succinctly with that they \"use the wisdom of crowds\", and since a performant Random Forest requires that each individual tree is uncorrelated, perhaps varying the height and dimensionality of each tree in the Random Forest will lead to better results. That is, instead of compiling a Random Forest made up of trees of height `X` and dimensionality `Y`, a Random Forest model can be trained where each tree has a height between `X1 ... X2`, and a dimensionality between `Y1 ... Y2`. This might lead to the trees in the Random Forest being less correlated with each other than they were in the previously evaluated models.\n\nThis theory will be tested below by building a Random Forest model with 100 trees, with each tree having a dimesionality between five and ten and a height between three and five.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class MixedBinaryRandomForest(BinaryRandomForest):\n    def __init__(self, df, num_trees, tree_dimensionality_range, tree_height_range, target_col, seed=100):\n        \"\"\"Makes use of the BinaryDecisionTree class to allow for the construction of a Random Forest model.\n        \n        Keyword Arguments:\n        df - The training set DataFrame\n        num_trees - The number of decision trees in the Random Forest\n        tree_dimensionality_range - A range of subsets of variables that an individual tree should be trained on.

The intention behind enhancing the original `BinaryRandomForest` by creating a `MixedBinaryRandomForest` was to add diversity to the model with the hope of therefore reducing correlation amongst the constituent trees. However, while each tree in the `MixedBinaryRandomForest` can have a range of heights and a range of dimensionalities, each tree in the model will always split based on the same dimensions. That is, a tree in the model trained on the three dimensions `age`, `sex`, and `chol` will always make splits based on those same three dimensions. It will never split the dataset based on any of the other ten possible input dimensions - other trees will be needed to make decisions based off of those other dimensions.\n\nInstead of training a single binary decision tree based off of the same `k` dimensions for every node, what if a decision tree made a split based off a random `k` dimensions for every node? That is, the root node of a three-dimensional tree may split the dataset based on the variables `age`, `sex`, and `chol`, but a child node may make a split based off of the variables `fbs`, `slope`, and `thal`. In theory, this should further reduce the correlation among each decision tree in the Random Forest and therefore lead to better overall performance of the model. \n\nClasses for this new Random Forest model will be defined below.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class BDTShuffledNode(BDTNode):\n    def __init__(self, df, cols, target_col, level):\n        \"\"\"An individual node in a binary decision tree.

Secondly, the `BinaryDecisionTree` performance plateaus once a height of five is reached as the there are no more splits that would lead to information gain based on the three variables the model is restricted to. The `ShuffledBinaryDecisionTree` doesn't suffer from this same flaw - even though each node in the tree has the same dimensionality as each node in the `BinaryDecisionTree`, each node is presented with a random set of variables such that there is a chance that all thirteen input variables will be used by the tree to make splits for information gain. The `ShuffledBinaryDecisionTree` isn't restricted in its information in the same rigid manner that the `BinaryDecisionTree` is.\n\nHowever, a `ShuffledBinaryDecisionTree` will not perform the same as a `BinaryDecisionTree` trained on all possible dimensions. While both trees have the potential to be trained on all input variables, the `BinaryDecisionTree` will always make the split that leads to the most information gain across all input variables. The `ShuffledBinaryDecisionTree`, meanwhile, will make the split that leads to the most information gain across only the variables the specific node was provided.\n\nThe implication of this behavior is that the `ShuffledBinaryDecisionTree` will have a lot more variance in performance than the `BinaryDecisionTree`. It has the potential to make sub-optimal splits in the training set, but this may lead to better modeling of the data in the testing set. A `BinaryDecisionTree` model trained on only a subset of the input variables, meanwhile, will have poor performance if it is provided with variables that are noisy or only loosely correlated with the target variable. \n\nTherefore, a `ShuffledBinaryDecisionTree` will - in general - have significantly better performance than a `BinaryDecisionTree` of the same dimensionality, but more variance in performance than a `BinaryDecisionTree` trained on all input variables. This is why the `BinaryDecisionTree` provided with all input variables was able to achieve a Weighted F1 score of 79%, while the `ShuffledBinaryDecisionTree` trained above was only able to achieve a maximum Weighted F1 score of 78%.\n\nBut what would happen if the predictions of many `ShuffledBinaryDecisionTrees` were aggregated? Then, in theory, the bias of a single tree would be cancelled out by the other trees in the aggregation as long as they tended to be biased in different ways. (Of course, then, you'd have a Random Forest).\n\nThe `ShuffledRandomForest` is the typical manner in which a Random Forest model will be implemented in most libraries, and the results obtained previously in this noteboook help to reflect why. The `ShuffledRandomForest` with 100 trees was able to obtain a Weighted F1 score of 90% on the dataset.

This is 18% higher than the best performing `BianryDecisionTree` model, and 11% higher than the best performing `BinaryRandomForest` or `MixedBinaryRandomForest` model. This is a remarkable improvement, and it's possible that a `ShuffledBinaryRandomForest` model with more trees with greater heights would perform even better.\n\nThese results highlight the advantages of a Random Forest model over a simple Decision Tree model, but also what specific features a Random Forest model needs to have to accurately model a dataset. A Random Forest should be made up of many uncorrelated trees, with each individual tree contributing some useful information to the overall model such that the average of all predictions made by the model is accurate for any given input.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
