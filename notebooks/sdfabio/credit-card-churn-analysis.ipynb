So they want us to explain how we can predict this in the future, and to discover the type of customer who are sensible to release their subscription. With this information they will be able to approach them before the churn and propose them new services to encourage them staying with the bank. \n\nHow are we gonna do that ? With the data they provide us on the credit card activity for 11027 Customers. Of course the customers identity have been anonymized. \n\nBased on the data and with our analysis we will sort out valuable insights to predict possible future churning customer. \n\nThe work is separated in differents parts:\n\n[Table of contents:](#ToC)\n\n[Importing all the necessary libraries](#0thPart)\n\n[1.

Having an outstanding Machine Learning pipeline is useless, if no business intuition or decision can be based on its results.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [What is Customer Churn & How to Reduce It?](https://medium.com/@paldesk/what-is-customer-churn-how-to-reduce-it-402460e5b569)\n- [Retain more customers by understanding churn](https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/retain-more-customers-by-understanding-churn-ae31d9b2aa2b)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='0thPart'></a>\n## Importing all necesaries libraries:\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='1stPart'></a>\n# 1.

Functional knowledge allows to create new variables and get insights from our machine learning output;\n2. get insights that could bring to better output results, such as which variable are related to the target variable or with each other. This is the stepping stone for a good model, since it allows to select the right number of variables (avoiding useless or correlated features) in agreement with Occam's razor principle;  \n\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;color:Green\"><b>RESULTS:</b></span>\n\nIn the dataset we can find three main classes of features:\n* **anagraphical features:** *Customer_Age, Gender, Education_Level, Marital_Status, Income_Category*. Their meaning is straightforward;\n\n* **customer-bank relationship features:** \n    - Dependent_count: [number of people uses that specific account](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/discussion/201767);\n    - Card_Category: is this a Premium or a Basic account?\n    - Months_on_book: the duration of the relationship as of now;\n    - Total_Relationship_Count: Total number of products held by the customer. In other words, client could have other products like debit card, loans, and so on;\n    - Contacts_Count_12_mon: the number of contacts between the customer and the bank in the last 12 months. It could be a key indicator of the satisfaction level of the client: the more contacts, the higher the probability that there is something that causes attrition;\n    \n    \n* **Credit Card utilization features:**\n    - Months_Inactive: it determines how many months the client has been inactive. However this variable is not entirely clear to me: official documentation states that this inactivity status is recorded among the last 12 months. However the highest value of this variable is 6 and it is not clear whether this is the number of *consecutive* months of inactivity. In my personal opinion, this variable shows the maximum number of consecutive months of inactivity and a customer is classified as *churned* after 6 or 7 months of inactivity;\n    - Credit_Limit: this is the maximum amount the client is allowed to use;\n    - Total_Revolving_Bal: the debt amount. For example the revolving balance value in february is determined by: $$Debt\\_February=Debt\\_January+CreditUsed\\_February-DebtPaid\\_February$$\n    - Avg_Open_To_Buy: suppose a client has used 500£, and its credit limit is 2500£. The custormer is thus *open to buy* 2500-500=2000£. Avg_Open_To_Buy is the average over the last 12 months of the Open To Buy value;\n    - Total_Trans_Amt: total transactional amount in the last 12 months;\n    - Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1: the ratio between transactional amount of first quarter and the same amount for fourth quarter. Hence, a value smaller tha 1 means that the customer has spent less in this quarter with respect to the last one;\n    - Total_Trans_Ct, Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1: their meaning is analogous to the last two variables. Of course, thee differ on the underlying reference variable, since in this case it is the number of transactions instead of the amount;\n    - Avg_Utilization_Ratio: $$Utilization\\_Ratio=\\frac{Credit\\_Limit-Open\\_To\\_Buy}{Credit\\_Limit}=\\frac{Credit\\_Used}{Credit\\_Limit}$$\n    Avg_Utilization_Ratio is the average proportion of the credit used with respect to the credit liit in the last 12 months.\n    \n\nThere are two more features:\n* **CLIENTNUM:** primary key of the dataset. For the sake of the project, it is not useful;\n* **Attrition_Flag:** whether the customer is an attrited one or not. Attrited customer are referred to *closed* accounts, thus there might be clients *near to churn* in the dataset but classified as normal clients (this will cause some errors, like we will see below).  \nWe can observe that it is an unbalanced distribution (about 84% of the data belong to the class *Existing Customer*, whereas only 16% of clients are in the class of churned ones). This means that any standard machine learning algorithm will struggle to classify correctly the minority class. For more on this, please refer to [3.

Then this feature can be a good predictor to sort out which client will possibly churn. \n\nOne way to measure the difference between the 2 distribution is by doing the **Student's T-test** which allow us to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean of 2 distributions.
