As well as people get used to their local water and get better immunity to it.\nSo, subjective conclusion for particular region's water quality and people's immunity to it can't be generalized for the rest of the world.\n\nThese considerations put in doubt the consistency of the data supplied.\n\nThanks to previous contributors, it was shown that the correlations between parameters are very low.\nAs to me, this is good. This means that the parameters measured are independent and can be used for characterizing the water samples.\nAnd one doesn't waste the resources for measuring parameters with high correlation or well-established relationship.\n\nBut look at the following lists:\n- [National Primary Drinking Water Standards](https://www.water-research.net/index.php/standards/primary-standards)\n- [National Secondary Drinking Water Standards](https://water-research.net/index.php/standards/secondary-standards)\n\nAren't there too many of them? And which ones do we have in our data?\nDo we have enough data to determine not only theoretical but applied value of water potability?\nWill those potability values be consistent with well-known established standards?\nAnd moreover, which of our parameters are also not primary but even secondary?\n\nLet's take a look at the following table.\n**<center>Water Quality Allowed Values\n<br>by WHO (World Health Organization), USA, Canada</center>**\n\n | N | Parameter | Allowed Value | Importance | Comment |Reference Link |\n |---|---|---|---|---|----|\n | 0 | ph | 6.5 to 8.5 | Secondary | No guidelines | [WHO](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/ph_revised_2007_clean_version.pdf)\n | 1 | Hardness | 151 to 300 mg/L | Secondary | No guidelines | [USA](https://www.healthvermont.gov/environment/drinking-water/hardness-drinking-water)\n | 2 | Solids | 1200 mg/L | Secondary | Same as TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) | [WHO](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/ph_revised_2007_clean_version.pdf)\n | 3 | **Chloramines** | 4 ppm | **Primary** | Chlorine disinfection traces | [USA](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/water_disinfection.html)\n | 4 | Sulfate | 250 ppm | Secondary | Mostly from natural sources | [USA](https://www.water-research.net/index.php/sulfates)\n | 5 | Conductivity | 400 μS/cm | Secondary | Derived value | [WHO](https://rdcu.be/cubAf)\n | 6 | **Organic_carbon** | 10 ppm | **Primary** | Organic molecules cumulative value | [Canada](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/air-land-water/water/waterquality/water-quality-guidelines/approved-wqgs/organic-carbon-tech.pdf)\n | 7 | **Trihalomethanes** | 80 ppb | **Primary** | Chlorine disinfection traces also  | [USA](https://archive.epa.gov/enviro/html/icr/web/html/gloss_dbp.html)\n | 8 | **Turbidity** | 5 NTU | **Primary** | Measured by water scattered light | [WHO](https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/turbidity-information-200217.df)\n\n\nIn order to be as consistent as possible, I tried to gather water quality standards from the same region, preferably USA, Canada or WHO (World Health Organization).\nSo, 5 out 9 parameters in our given dataset turned out to be secondary and 4 (less than half) of them were primary.\n\nFrankly, not a really good set of parameters for making responsible predictions.\nBut anyway, let's figure out what fraction of a given dataset fits into the above mentioned standards.\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-17T13:05:39.269445Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-17T13:05:39.269996Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-17T13:05:39.342372Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-17T13:05:39.269947Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-17T13:05:39.341046Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import
