Most data scientist see **number of trees, tree depth and the learning rate** as most crucial parameters.\n* **Number of trees**: A high number of trees can be computationally expensive. Generally, with a change in learning rate,n_estimators should also be adjusted (10-fold decrease in learning_rate should go in line with a approx. 10-fold increase in n_estimators.\n* **Learning rate**: Determines the contribution of each tree on the final outcome and controls how quickly the algorithm proceeds down the gradient descent (learns). This hyperparameter is also called shrinkage. Generally, the smaller this value, the more accurate the model can be but also will require more trees in the sequence.\n* **Tree depth**: Controls the depth of the individual trees. Typical values range from a depth of 3–8 but it is not uncommon to see a tree depth of 1.\n\nParameter tuning is a crucial task in finding the model with the highest predictive power.
