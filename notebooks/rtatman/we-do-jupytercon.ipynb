Guided instructions where students practice applying the material alone or in groups with instructor assistance & availability\n3. Independent practice, where learners work alone, applying what they've learned\n\nSince this workshop focuses on active learning, let's work through an example of an \"I do, We do, You do\" curriculum designed around a specific learning goal:\n\n> <strong>Learning goal</strong>: By the time you finish this introduction, you will learn how to put a chunk of code you routinely use in a Python function.

For in-person classes, less text may be better (to give students room to take their own notes) but for materials you'll be presenting on-line. \n* Will you be teaching in your learners' native language? I've found that more supporting text can be especially helpful for learners who are taking a course in their second (or third or fourth or fifth!) language. \n* Do you have a lot of references in your teaching? If you typically refer to a large number of resources while you're teaching, adding links in your notebook can help students use these resources more easily.  \n* Do you want students to refer to materials in the future? If your notebooks are more like workbooks, just for in-class exercises, then you probably don't need a lot of supporting text. If you want learners to have a single source to refer to in the future, though, (like this notebook!) you may want to include more supporting text.\n* Plug in to turn cells into slides: Rise (static) & reveal.js (live)\n\nWriting more supporting may take longer at the front end but, if you're effective at anticipating what your students' questions might be and answering them preemptively in your supporting text, it may end up saving you time in the end.\n\nNo matter how much supporting text you choose to write, however, I'd strongly recommend including a learning goal."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3a3cbeff0baa3bbb081da11fd991190a6a98d38d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise\n\nThink about a small computational task that you might need to teach, with about the same level of complexity as putting code into functions or making a specific type of graph. \n\nFirst, write a learning for the task.

If you're you want students to learn how to apply a specific type of statistical test, for example, don't also do your pre-processing in your example code. \n* Comment your heart out. Even you might not use that many comments in code for your own work, if you have a large class you're almost certain to have at least one student who's never seen whatever common thing it is that you're doing.\n* Follow best practices for your community (e.g. use a style guide, clear variable names, consistent use of white space, etc.).

That said, I do have some tips:\n\n* Only ask students to do one thing at a time. That thing should be stated in your learning goal.\n* For an in-class exercise, aim for code that it would take you no more than five minutes to write. In my experience, it takes learners approximately four times as long as write code as it does me, and students tend to burn out after twenty minutes. (Your mileage may vary, of course.)\n* Triple check that your exercise instructions are clear and correct. It's frustrating for students if they can't trust the course material & it erodes trust.\n* Don't worry about always writing exercises that have exactly one correct answer. Helping students become comfortable with ambiguity is a great service you can do them as a teacher. \n* My recommendation is to make in-class work \"low stakes\" (i.e. ungraded) so that students can feel more free to make mistakes as they get to grips with the material for the first time. \n\n\nSome ideas for exercises: \n* Give students code that has a common bug in it and ask them to fix the bug. (Remind them that it's ok to refer to outside sources like StackOverflow! :)\n* \"One missing piece\" type exercises, like we did in the first section. Give students code that is missing just one or two lines for them to fill in. You can also \n* Have students work from pseudocode. I like to write pseudocode as comments (one comment per line of code) and \n* Have students write pseudocode from actual code. (This can be especially revealing for you as a teacher since it will let you find unexpected problems with students' mental models!)\n\n\n### Exercise:\n\nYou've guessed it: you're going to write an exercise to go with the learning goal, supporting text & example code you wrote earlier.

My rule of thumb: have students do something that would take me no more than 15 minutes to do. \n* If you don't already have one, consider providing a class forum for students so they can ask each other questions. (Although I've had very mixed success with forums: it really depends on the amount of comraderie the students build in class.)\n\nAlso, don't feel wedded to the notebook format. You can also give students assignments to complete on their own with whatever tools they wish.

Here are some of my strategies for encouraging students to collaborate productively.\n\n\n### Build buy in\n\nIt can be helpful to explicitly discuss why you're having students collaborate. I've found it helpful to talk about my experiences co-authoring papers to show that this isn't just busy-work: it's an important skill!\n\n### Design assignments to be fair\n\nDifferent students will put different amounts into projects, so it can be helpful for you to have a way to evaluate this.\n\n* Have students use version control for their projects & check the commit logs. That will really help you get a good sense of who used what. (Plus it's good practice for your students. :)\n* Consider pre-segmenting the work/defining the roles in the group and having students pick which they want. So for a data science capstone, you could split the work into scoping the project/defining the problem, finding data, preparing data for analysis, and different segments of analysis (visualization, summarization, etc.). Encourage students to work on all parts, but have one student ultimately responsible for each segment.\n\n### Have frequent check-ins\n\nAvoid procrastination and avoid end-of-term blow ups by having frequent check-ins. For groups in class, this can mean just working through the room and seeing how groups are getting on, while for long-term projects it's probably going to look more like intertrim deadlines.\n\n\n### Include self/group evaluation\n\nTo make sure students know you hear their side of the story, have them include a  self-evaluation and evaluation for each member of the group along with the final assignment. (This can just be a rubric you have them fill out.) Don't base grades entirely on peer feedback, but if most members of a group single out a member as doing an exceptional job you might consider that in your grading. \n\n### Exercise\n\nWhat have you found helpful in encouraging collaboration? Spend a few minutes brainstorming, then meet in small groups to share tactics & resources."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c93da52f031ffe74bcbe9cdbb3b524530b68c14e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Practical considerations \n___\n\nFinally, let's cover some practical considerations around using notebooks in the classroom. \n\n## Hosted notebooks versus having students download notebooks\n\nOften times, \n\nIf you're having students download notebooks: Don't \n\n* Try to get students to install everything before class (that much strain on classroom internet can be really frustrating) but know that many students won't. \n* In a longer course, plan on spending the first day getting everyone's environment set up. \n* In a shorter course or workshop, provide a virtual machine for students to download. The majority of problems that crop up are due to differences between operating systems or language/package versions. Providing a VM will get rid of these (although it will introduce the problem of starting the VM!)\n\nIf you're using a hosted notebook:\n\n* Make sure that students sign up for the service before class. (Some services will let you use notebooks without signing in but will also erase your work.)\n* Spend some time getting to know the platform so that you can help with student \n* Make sure you will have adequate internet access in your classroom, especially if you're planning on downloading large datasets.\n\n### Options for hosted notebooks\n\nHere's a quick overview of some of the hosted notebook services available for you. (Note that these specs may change, so double check before getting your course set up.)\n\n![](https://svgshare.com/i/7w5.svg)\n\n\n## Pacing of material and classroom management\n\nFinally, some notes on classroom pacing. This format of teaching is much more variable than lectures, so a combination of flexibility in pacing and good time-management is a must. \n\nHere are some of my tips for keeping things on track:\n\n* Have a rough guide (to the nearest 15 minutes) for the course. I've found that course plans with any finer granularity get off-track quick enough that they're no longer useful almost immediately.\n* Make sure you have five to ten minutes at the end of class to review what you've covered so in class & give learners a sense of closure.\n* Plan on no more than three exercises an hour, and fewer if you have a discussion component. \n* To give yourself extra wiggle room, include both additional challenge exercises (in this case, the homework) and a throw-away exercise you can cut if time runs short (in this case the Encouraging Student Collaboration exercise). \n* Put more important material first. Basics first, then nuance.\n* If you know your students, pick groups that have students with different levels of comfort with the material. This will prevent the problem of having one very fast group and one very slow one."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c2d69278d08ff05465515130c18ee75055b4337f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Your homework!\n____\n\nIn this workshop I've modelled teaching using the I do/we do/you do, but so far we've only hit \"I Do\" and \"You Do\". Now it's time for you to practice applying these concepts to your own cirriculum.\n\n1. Take one key concept or task you want your learners to be able to do. \n2. State this as a learning goal (what will students be able to do once they've finished?)\n3. Design at least two small exercises that will help students learn how to complete part of the task you put forth in your learning goal. (If you find that the smaller tasks start to drift away from your learning goal, either redesign your tasks or restate your learning goal.) Complete an example exercise yourself to model the expected behaviour, and then write the exercises to help your students \n4. Finally, design a homework exercise for your students to help them practice what you've modelled and they've practiced together.
