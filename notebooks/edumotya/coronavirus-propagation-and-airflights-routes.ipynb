This is the most complete open airflights routes dataset I have found, even though the last updated date back to 2014. In fact, the dataset webpage warnings that \"the third-party that OpenFlights uses for route data ceased providing updates in June 2014. The current data is of historical value only\". \n\nTherefore, we cannot expect a precise analysis here, since the airflights routes may have dramatically change. I am not an expert on this field, and maybe some of you may shed light on this matter. \n\n![](http://)Moreover, this dataset does not provide information of the actual traffic of these routes. It describes the routes (airline X operating from airport A to airport B), but it does not account for the passenger flux of these routes, nor is the date time information available. Thus, most of the kernel prepares the OpenFlights dataset for the visualization."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Proof of concept\n___\n\nBefore writting a single line of code, I want to check whether there is some kind of correlation between the propagation of the virus (during 2019 and 2020) and the airflights routes (till 2014). To do so, I just use the [OpenFlights interface](https://openflights.org/) and I search the routes for the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport.\n\nComparing coronavirus propagation and the flights departing from Wuhan,  we can observe that the two figures roughly match one another:\n\n- Most regions far from the epicenter are connected through a direct flight route from Wuhan.\n\n- We do not see any connection from Wuhan to North America, neither to Oceania nor Africa. We guess that there is an indirect connection between these places. \n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1piaVoYDrLLle4ROvjELGNJ-l4XP9Qex3\" width=\"1000px\">\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ONHcu2f5pIa5A_SRcZojN8npi0vepT7D\" width=\"1000px\">"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Imports"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\nfrom shapely.geometry import Point\nfrom shapely.ops import nearest_points\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom tqdm import tqdm_notebook as tqdm\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n\n\nimport folium\nfrom folium import Choropleth, Circle, Marker\nfrom folium.plugins import HeatMap, MarkerCluster\n\nfrom itertools import tee\n\ndef pairwise(iterable):\n    \"s -> (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ...\"\n    a, b = tee(iterable)\n    next(b, None)\n    return zip(a, b)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Reading coronavirus data\n___\nBig thanks to [Brenda So](https://www.kaggle.com/brendaso) for her original coronavirus [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/brendaso/2019-coronavirus-dataset-01212020-01262020) and to [Mykola](https://www.kaggle.com/grebublin) for his geocoded [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grebublin/coronavirus-latlon-dataset). \n\nI will use here the geocoded dataset."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# just downloading the dataset, which has all the necessary data already\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/coronavirus-latlon-dataset/coronavirus_cleaned_21Jan2Feb.csv\", index_col=0)\n# WARNING: set the coordinates for the province of Hubei to its capital Wuhan, instead of the geo-pyshical center.\n# It helps to match the routes more precisely, at least from the epicenter to the rest of the world.\ndf.loc[df[\"Province/State\"]==\"Hubei\", [\"lon\", \"lat\"]] = [114.283333, 30.583332]\n# Cast into GeoDataFrame\ndf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=[Point(xy) for xy in zip(df['lon'], df['lat'])])\n# Set coordinate reference system\ndf.crs = {'init' :'epsg:4326'}  \ndf.head(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Reading OpenAirflights data\n___\n\nThe OpenFlights dataset is already available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/open-flights/airline-database), but I have created a new kaggle dataset using updated data from the [original sources](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Routes from A to B"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"columns_and_dtypes = {\n    'Airline': \"category\", # 2-letter (IATA) or 3-letter (ICAO) code of the airline.\n    'Airline ID': \"category\", # Unique OpenFlights identifier for airline.\n    'Source Airport': \"category\", # 3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the source airport.\n    'Source Airport ID': \"category\", # Unique OpenFlights identifier for source airport.\n    'Destination Airport': \"category\", # 3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the destination airport.\n    'Destination Airport ID': \"category\", # Unique OpenFlights identifier for destination airport.\n    'Codeshare': \"category\", # \"Y\" if this flight is a codeshare (that is, not operated by Airline, but another carrier), empty otherwise.\n    'Stops': int, # Number of stops on this flight (\"0\" for direct)\n    'Equipment': \"category\" # 3-letter codes for plane type(s) generally used on this flight, separated by spaces\n}\nroutes = pd.read_csv('../input/openflights-20200201-dump/routes.dat', \n                     names=columns_and_dtypes.keys(),\n                     dtype=columns_and_dtypes)\ndisplay(routes.head(3))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Airports\n\nI use the dataset airports.csv, therefore, I only consider \"airport\" terminals.
