What is the Big Five personality test used for?\n\n\nThe Big Five personality test gives you more insight into how you react in different situations, which can help you choose an occupation. Career professionals and psychologists use this information in a personality career test for recruitment and candidate assessment[[1]( https://www.123test.com/big-five-personality-theory/)].\n\n\nThe big five come from the statistical study of responses to personality items. Using a technique called factor analysis researchers can look at the responses of people to hundreds of personality items and ask the question \"what is the best was to summarize an individual?\". This has been done with many samples from all over the world and the general result is that, while there seem to be unlimited personality variables, five stand out from the pack in terms of explaining a lot of a persons answers to questions about their personality: extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience. The big-five are not associated with any particular test, a variety of measures have been developed to measure them. This test uses the Big-Five Factor Markers from the International Personality Item Pool, developed by Goldberg (1992)[[2](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/)].\n\n* Procedure\n\nThe test consists of fifty items that you must rate on how true they are about you on a five point scale where 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral and 5=Agree. It takes most people 3-8 minutes to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"papermill":{"duration":0.039048,"end_time":"2021-03-24T10:07:25.203654","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-03-24T10:07:25.164606","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-03-24T10:07:25.293273Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-03-24T10:07:25.292334Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-03-24T10:07:27.694921Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-03-24T10:07:27.695455Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.452472,"end_time":"2021-03-24T10:07:27.695796","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-03-24T10:07:25.243324","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pylab as pl\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n%matplotlib inline\nimport wordcloud\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud,STOPWORDS\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator\nfrom sklearn.utils import shuffle\nimport matplotlib.ticker as mtick\n\n# Plotly\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport colorlover as cl\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-03-24T10:07:27.782062Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-03-24T10:07:27.781378Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-03-24T10:07:44.853077Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-03-24T10:07:44.853616Z"},"papermill":{"duration":17.118262,"end_time":"2021-03-24T10:07:44.853794","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-03-24T10:07:27.735532","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/big-five-personality-test/IPIP-FFM-data-8Nov2018/data-final.csv', delimiter='\\t')\ndata","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-03-24T10:07:44.942949Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-03-24T10:07:44.941677Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-03-24T10:07:47.424276Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-03-24T10:07:47.423563Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.529563,"end_time":"2021-03-24T10:07:47.424428","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-03-24T10:07:44.894865","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Check Missing Value\nprint('Is there any missing value?
