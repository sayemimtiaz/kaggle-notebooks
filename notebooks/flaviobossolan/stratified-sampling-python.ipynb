A simple random sample could ignore this fact.\n\nThere are many use cases for stratified sampling. The main idea is that we want to mimic a population with a sample. It is widely used to generate comparable samples when the objective is to perform hypothesis testing of any kind.\n\nMany times I had to face this situation, so I developed a module in Python with functions that performs stratified sampling given a pandas DataFrame object. I hope it can be useful in your endevors.\n\nFor this example I will use a dataset with information about customers. It will be useful since it contains lots of variables we can use to perform stratified sampling.\n\n*This module can also be found in [this github repo](https://github.com/flaviobossolan/python_stratified_sampling)*"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/bank-additional-full.csv', sep=';')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# the functions:\ndef stratified_sample(df, strata, size=None, seed=None, keep_index= True):\n    '''\n    It samples data from a pandas dataframe using strata.
