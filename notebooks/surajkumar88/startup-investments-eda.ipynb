While entrepreneurship refers to all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to become registered, startups refer to new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder. Startups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be successful and influential. Some startups become unicorns: privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion.\n\nOne of the startup's first tasks is raising a substantial amount of money to further develop the product. To do that, they have to make a strong argument, if not a prototype, that supports their claim that their idea is truly new or a great improvement to something on the market.\n\nThough a vast majority of startups fail, some of history's most successful entrepreneurs created startups like Microsoft (founded by Bill Gates), Ford Motors (founded by Henry Ford), and McDonald's (founded by Ray Kroc).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"3\"></a>\n# 3.
