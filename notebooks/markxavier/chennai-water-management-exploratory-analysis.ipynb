This is due in part to two years of inadequate monsoon seasons, but increasing urbanization have caused some encroachment on water bodies in and around the region.

Well, if we were interested in starting to model, we might decide to run a regression analysis on the last plots, and identify whether aggregated rainfall can tell us what the reservoir levels will be like some $X$ number of days later.  We could also use unsupervised clustering on the individual rainfall or reservoir level data to confirm that there was indeed a shift in the average reservoir level over time.\n\nIf we wanted to do some highly predictive modeling, especially via machine learning methods, we probably would want to include some more data, including the population in chennai, the low/high temperatures per day, the number of households near the reservoirs (to account for urbanization affecting the reservoirs' performance), etc.  Any (and likley all) of these features might help us predict what reservoir levels might be in the future based on projected rainfall, which may help people better prepare for droughts before they happen."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
