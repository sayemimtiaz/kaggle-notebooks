Introduction\n\n**Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)** is a contagious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable with most common symptoms are fever, dry cough and tiredness. On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, and up to 14 days. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus can recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\nA **COVID‑19 vaccine** is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Several different types of potential vaccines for COVID-19 are in development, including:\n\n* RNA and DNA vaccines, a cutting-edge approach that uses genetically engineered RNA or DNA to generate a protein that itself safely prompts an immune response.\n* Inactivated or weakened virus vaccines, which use a form of the virus that has been inactivated or weakened so it doesn’t cause disease, but still generates an immune response.\n* Viral vector vaccines, which use a safe virus that cannot cause disease but serves as a platform to produce coronavirus proteins to generate an immune response.\n* Protein-based vaccines, which use harmless fragments of proteins or protein shells that mimic the COVID-19 virus to safely generate an immune response.\n\nAs of March 2021, 12 vaccines were authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use: \n* two RNA vaccines (the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine)\n* four conventional inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV, CoronaVac, Covaxin, and CoviVac)\n* four viral vector vaccines (Sputnik V, the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, Convidicea, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine)\n* two protein subunit vaccines (EpiVacCorona and RBD-Dimer)\n\nIn total, as of March 2021, 308 vaccine candidates were in various stages of development, with 73 in clinical research, including 24 in Phase I trials, 33 in Phase I–II trials, and 16 in Phase III development.\n\nThe purpose of this notebook is to provide analysis on the progress of COVID-19 Vaccination in the world.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n<a id=\"3\"></a>\n# 2.

The `United States` government has a deal with Johnson & Johnson for delivery of 200 million doses and also with Pfizer and Moderna for a combined 600 million doses which is enough to inoculate 300 million Americans, since both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots given three to four weeks apart.\n* In the second place there is `India`, it has fully vaccinated `8.1 million` of its total population but it is still consider small when it compored with its total population of `1.4 billion`. It started its vaccination in mid January 2021 and reaching its peak on March 2021 at `2.2 million` per day. Numbers of vaccination is increased rapidly since the beginning of March 2021 due to the expanded eligibility criteria to include people over 60 and those who are between 45 and 59 but have other illnesses. The government has now announced that from 1 April, the jab will be available to anyone aged 45 years and above which will increased the number of vaccinations in the future.\n* `Turkey` is in the third place with `5.5 million` people have been fully vaccinated. Compared to its total population, `Turkey` has fully vaccinated `6.5%` of its total  population. It started its vacination since mid January 2021 and reaching its peak at `0.4 million` per day.
