This measures if the spread of COVID-19 is increasing or looks like it is slowing down.\n* Inflection point: The spread of a disease in general follows a logistic curve(S-curve).

Beyond this curve, the growth factor slows down with less than 1.\n\nLet's start with analyzing South Korea and China as they are way ahead in their outbreak journey with a clear saturation in their curve.
