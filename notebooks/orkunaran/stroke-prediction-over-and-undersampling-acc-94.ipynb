And I also practiced my model interpretation,  bayesian distribution- skewness-kurtosis values, hyperparameter tuning and tried Feature Importance(way to go btw)\n\nAnyways,\nRandom Forest Classification did a good job on predicting clients with Stroke. Not only accuracy scores are good, additionally Precision, Recall, F1-scores and ROC curve and AUC score are also good.\n\nPS: \nI learned that I made a mistake using SMOTE on all the data. So I changed the process as follows:\nSplit the data into train and test datasets\nUsed SMOTE to increase 'Stroke' values in train df, then used nearmiss to decrease 'No stroke' value. This way I prevented the estimation of stroke data too much. \nThen trained the model and made a prediction.\n\nAlso, we sse the random forest classifier model overfit. ","metadata":{}}]}
