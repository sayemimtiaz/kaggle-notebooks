Introduction\n\n### 2.1 Question-Answering (QA) model\n\nIn machine learning, a question-answering model is composed of three sources: the `question`, the `context` and the `answer`. The model inputs are the `question` and the `context` and the model output is the `answer`. In most cases, but not all, the `answer` is contained in the `context`. For simplicity, throughout the notebook, we will assume that this is indeed true.\n\nIt exists many datasets used to train the QA model. One of the most popular is she Stanford Question Answering Dataset, also known as [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). It contains thousands of tuples of the type (`question`, `context`, `answer`) used to teach the model what does it means to both **find** and **return** a question. During training, the model exploits and learn linguistical properties of the language.\n\n### 2.2 Using a search engine to produce the context\n\nIn general, the `context` is quite limited, about one page. In our case, instead, we are dealing with more than 40k papers. **We need therefore to reduce the size of the context**. We do so by selecting all the papers that are most similar to the `answer`. In the code, a very simple algorithm, [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25), is used. As you will see, even if Okapi BM25 is quite old (from 1980), it does a great job. In future, I plan to compare the Okapi solution against other most recent approaches and solutions such as transformers.\n\n\n### 2.3 From (context, question) to answer with transformers\n\nThis is the most interesting and magic part of all the notebook. Given a question `q` (we use the term query and question interchangeably), the previous section gives us a list of context. Now, for each context and for the same query `q`, we ask to a pre-trained and pretty-powerful transformer model what is the part of the context that **better represent** the query.\n\nYou may ask how in just a few lines of code we can build such a powerful model. The reason why is that we make use of the (great, you need to check it out if you haven't!) [Huggingface transformer library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) that permits us to work with ease with such complex and big neural networks.\n\nThe data obtained now, are dirty and hard to read. That's why for each task and for each question we visualize the context and the highlighted answer in a friendly way.\n\n### 2.4 Summarization abstract for each question [Coming Soon]\n\nThe code for the summarization has been written but hasn't been tested and visualized yet.\n\n### 2.5 Acknowledgement\n\nThis notebook has been inspired from the great work of:\n\n- https://www.kaggle.com/dgunning/building-a-cord19-research-engine-with-bm25 by DwightGunning\n- https://www.kaggle.com/dirktheeng/anserini-bert-squad-for-semantic-corpus-search by Dirk\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.
