Among all types of cancer, breast cancer has become frequent among women and it causes the death of many of them. According to [here](https://canceratlas.cancer.org/the-burden/breast-cancer/), in 140 out of 184 major countries in the world, this type of cancer has been diagnosed more than other types of cancers, and in 101 major countries, this is the most common cause of cancer death. Although breast cancer is the most prevailing type of cancer responsible for a large number of deaths every year, if it is diagnosed in an early stage, it can be cured.\n\nMachine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in which we use algorithms and computational statistics and let the machines and computers learn automatically from data without explicitly programming. For example, rather than writing many codes to detect a dog or cat with lots of if-else and loops commands, we provide a sufficient number of dog and cat pictures along with their labels and let the machine learn how to identify them in a picture. In the past, due to the lack of data and computation power of computers, it was not possible to do so. However, in recent years, with the growth of technology, lots of data is produced and computer computation power is improved so much. \n\nWith lots of medical data and powerful tools to train an ML model, some started using ML and data analytics tools in the healthcare industry. One of the interesting subjects in analyzing medical data is the diagnosis of cancer from medical images. \n\nNevertheless, some models require a great amount of time to be trained and cannot be used in the real world due to its complexity. Lots of researches have been conducted by many people to introduce a better, faster, and more comprehensive way to analyze the data and extract useful information. Nonetheless, high dimensional data is a problem for most of the data mining algorithms, and data dimension reduction is needed to improve the speed of the training. **Although this dataset is relatively small and it is not needed to use dimension reduction techniques, we are going to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in this notebook just for practice.******","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis) is a well-known dataset in healthcare on which lots of research has been conducted.

Nowadays, we are dealing with some complex data, i.e. multi-dimensional data, which has lots of attributes and observations. In these kinds of data, there are too many variables to consider and it may affect the training of some ML models. Moreover, visualization and interpolation of these datasets are hard. To avoid these problems, it is better to use dimension reduction techniques before applying different ML models. Dimension reduction techniques reduce the feature space, so, it eases the processing time. Also, when we are dealing with fewer attributes, it is easier to make different plots and interpret them. There are many such techniques in the literature, but most of them fall in into two below categories:\n\n1. **Feature selection**: In which we reduce the feature space dimension by eliminating some attributes.\n2. **Feature extraction**: These techniques try to create new independent variables by combining old variables.\n\nHowever, the first technique has a major disadvantage which is we may lose some information by dropping any attribute. \n\nPCA is a feature extraction technique in which we use a linear transformation of feature vectors into uncorrelated vectors. \n\nWe note our data matrix by $X_{n*p}$, where $n$ is the number of observations, i.e. rows, and $p$ is the number of attributes, i.e. columns.\nAssume we have centered our data matrix so that we make sure every attribute has a zero mean, and they contribute toward computing variance evenly. We call the centered or adjusted data matrix $Y_{n*p}$. Then we should compute the covariance matrix $C_{p*p}$ as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{cov_mat_1}\nC = \\frac{1}{n-1} Y^{\\prime} Y\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn the next step, we use Eigen-decomposition to calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix as follow:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{cov_mat_2}\nC = A \\Delta A^{\\prime} = \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\lambda_{j} a_{j} a^{\\prime}_{j}\n\\end{equation},\n\nwhere $A$ is a $p*p$ matrix of eigenvectors, $a_{j}$ is the $j^{\\text{th}}$ eigenvector of $S$, and $\\Delta_{j}$ is the $j^{\\text{th}}$ eigenvalue.\n\nFinally, we can project our $n*p$ dataset into the new dimension by computing $Z$ as follow:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{cov_mat_3}\nZ = Y A\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhere var($Z_{j}$) = $\\lambda_{j}$ and corr($Z_{i}$, $Z_{j}$) = 0 if $i$ is not equal to $j$. But, NO WORRY!!! All of the above math is handled by the scikit learn library. The below code shows the implementation of the PCA algorithm in python using scikit learn library. It is also worthy to note that the PCA algorithm should be fitted only on the training data. Therefore, it is required to split data into training and test set before fitting this algorithm.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# train and test split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(variables, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n\n# standardization\nsc_training = StandardScaler()\nX_train = sc_training.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = sc_training.transform(X_test)\n\n# Principal component analysis\npca = PCA()\nZ_train = pca.fit_transform(X_train)\nZ_test = pca.fit_transform(X_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-15T16:07:30.722692Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-15T16:07:30.72306Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-15T16:07:30.819653Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-15T16:07:30.723024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-15T16:07:30.818275Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To choose the number of Principal Components (PCs) to consider, we can take advantage of the explained variance.
