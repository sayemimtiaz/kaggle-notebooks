The algorithm will take this data as input and predict if a client will churn or not.

It has 93.5% precision for 80% recall, and 92.6% for 80% precision.\n- Neural Network Classifier (MLP) has a 95.3% accuracy. It has 90.2% precision for 80% recall, and 91.4% for 80% precision.\n- The Ensembled model of Random Forest Classifier has a 96.7% accuracy.

We can also see the issues that multicollinearity causes. Both the Total Transaction Amount and the Count are negatively correlated to the target variable. However, the coefficient for Total Transaction Amount is positive. This happens as a result of the high linear correlation with the Total Transaction Count, which distorts the model fitting. \n\nTo improve the performance of this model we could get rid of multicorrelated features, get rid of irrelevant features (the ones with the lowest absolute value for the logistic regression coefficients), and try both constraining and unconstraining the model. We could also break down some of the numeric features into categories, which would help capture the nonlinear relationships. However, there are more powerful models available that do this automatically, so let's explore them.
