In other words, separating dataset into labeled training and test(categorize) dataset with labeled data, it could be better with work with as binary classification.\nIn more detail, SVM uses margin and hyperplane instead of line to separate data into two or more different class. In order to separate classes, it can be drawn many different lines but by choosing best line it is considered that margin should be maximum in between support vectors which are the closest points with different classes. While SVM algorithm is working, it follows two rules which are firstly classify correctly, then increase the margins in hyperplane. Additionally, SVM is useful for non-linear classification by increasing dimension then find a new line classification in increased dimension.\nThe C parameter tells the SVM optimization how many misclassifying point of each training example. For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly.

The standard deviation reduction is based on the decrease in standard deviation after a dataset is split on an attribute.

work, it was aimed that the analyzing which psychochemical are more related with wine quality and which approach is good for prediction of wine quality better. After all work, it is obvious that working with binary classification is more better the predict good or bad wines. During this research, four important machine learning techniques was used;\n\n--> Logistic regression\n\n--> Support Vector Machine \n\n--> Decision Tree\n\n--> Random Forest\n\nFrom all algorithms, it was obvious that for this dataset, SVM and then Random Forest algorithm gave the best model and accuracy means that those algorithms predict correctly test data. If someone wants to analyze similar data like that it is better to work SVM or Random Forest. Hence, those algorithms variances are found better with high margin terminology, therefore with multiclass analysis, those algorithms will give the best accuracy.\nAfter the analysis of this dataset, some features have more effect to deciding quality of the wine, there are some insights about the criteria about wine quality, you can compare just looking the some psychochemical on the label of wines;\n*Should be higher;*\n\n** Alcohol is the most important feature to decide quality of the wine. If the alcohol percentage is high enough, it means that quality of the wine should be better\n\n** Sulphates is another selecting criteria for good wines, with high percentage sulphates wine quality is increasing\n\n** Citric Acid is another selecting criteria, it should be higher to decide more better wine\n\n*Should be lower;*\n\n** Volatile Acidity should be less in the good wine\n\n** Sulfur dioxide is another effect to decreasing wine quality and also it causes head ache therefore if\nthere is less sulfur dioxide in wine, it should be selected\n\n** Chlorides value has very less effect to quality of the wine but again it is obvious more value of it\ncauses bad quality of the wine\n\nAdditionally, for marketing point of view, if a customer wants to buy a wine just looking with some psychochemical values can decide what s/he needs to buy. Of course, brand and price feature was evaluated on this research, therefore, it is not a good analysis for saying “it is good wine”. However, it can give some idea for the people who do not have more knowledge about wine for selecting the good wine maybe for just dinner or gift for friends!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
