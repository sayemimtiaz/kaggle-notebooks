It is a worldwide entertainment beloved by many; there's a reason why most nations have their own professional football league system, and why there's lots of national, continental, and sometimes global level football competitions every often. What else sports can match this level of popularity?\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising then that video games featuring real-world clubs and players are also very popular. One of them is the FIFA series, a football simulation video game series developed by a major video game company Electronic Arts. It's a series in that the creators release a follow-up version every year - the latest version as of now is FIFA 20.\n\nAs a rough introduction, each player in the game is assigned an overall player rating out of 100 based on his performance in the preceding year. Of course these figures are updated annually in accordance with the latest real-world data. In FIFA 20, the best player in the game - Lionel Messi - was given an overall rating of 94, with detailed specs of the following: 88 pace, 96 dribbling, 92 shooting, 39 defence, 92 passing, and 66 physical. \n\nIf you come to think about it, that's quite detailed and precise - especially considering how attributes like such are difficult to be accurately quantified. Perhaps not surprisingly, the figures often spark debates and controversies among football fans. \n\nI wondered - how much are they relevant to the reality? How are the numbers assigned in the first place? Then again an idea struck my head - that this combined with other ideas could develop into an exciting DS project.

To be specific, how well, in general, do the player attribute numbers evaluate performances of players in the real world?\n\nBut what probably should come off first is, how are the numbers measured in the first place? Incidentally this was once answered in an interview by ESPN FC with Michael Mueller-Moehring, overseer of player rating calculations, back in 2016: https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/2959703/fifa-17-player-ratings-system-blends-advanced-stats-and-subjective-scouting\n\nIn short, the player ratings system takes into account two main sources of data: 1) advanced stats, such as number of goals scored/successful passes/saves, etc. 2) subjective data from a team of thousand data editors, field experts, and in-person game-goers. \n\nDespite their best efforts, however, the final output isn't totally free from misevaluation, and this is understandable - after all, football is a complex sports where so many variables come into play. As Mueller-Moehring rightly points out, \"the stats are, in most cases, not taking into account very specific circumstances\" - data simply can't tell everything.\n\nConclusion: they have a structured and rigid approach to their work, which renders the output reliable to some extent, yet inevitably subjectivity is still there, so do not take it seriously.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With all these said I judged that it is pointless to try gauaging how \"valid\" the numbers are, though this was precisely what drove me in the beginning.\n\n- Evaluating how \"accurate\" something requires a \"test set\"(i.e. the \"correct/truthful\" values) and in this case that \"test set\" is unavailable. For instance, what advanced real statistics and what combination of them can be used to accurately tell how \"good\" a midfielder is? What's more, football is an extremely complex sport - data alone aren't enough.\n\n- The ratings team, some of which are experts, have already been incorporating advanced stats.

Going by each,\n\n1) The Premier League, in terms of middle 75% range, has the edge over others when it comes to overall ratings. The Spanish La Liga is a strong competitor though - in fact it actually beats the Premier League at the very top, although by a small margin. One thing is clear - the French Ligue 1 is at the bottom among the five. Overall the order goes as: EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1. \n\nInterestingly enough, this order matches the UEFA country coefficients ranking for 2018-19: England(22.642), Spain(19.571), Germany(15.214), Italy(12.642), France(10.583). https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2019\nRoughly speaking, these country coefficients measure how well did the clubs in their respective nations in European competitions like the Champions League in one particular season.\n\n2) As for age, comparing the middle 75% ranges, Serie A players are the oldest in general. The youngest - Bundesliga.\n\n3) Bundesliga players in general are the tallest. Statistically speaking, among UK, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, Germany has the highest average height for men, and it seems like that is reflected here. Shortest - La Liga.\n\n4) As tall as they are, the Budesligans are the heaviest. The lightest: La Liga. \n\n5) All in all, Premier League players worth more than any other leaguers. The ranking order is the same as for overall rating - Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1. \n\n6) Overall, players in the Premier League are paid the highest, but this calls for consideration that they are paid in British pounds, not euros. The greatest wage gap can be seen in the Spanish La Liga, with standard deviation at around 77,334 euros! The least, Ligue 1, at around 29324 euros.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## A league of their own","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://editorial.uefa.com/resources/0257-0df007b5d341-78ad2e191c3b-1000/the_uefa_champions_league_group_stage_squads_have_been_confirmed.jpeg)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Like with any other field the public is mostly interested in some of the best players and clubs.

Understandably they aren't free of bias but their work speaks and have reputation for that.\n\n2) All the overall ratings can be explained almost entirely with the associated \"key\" attributes, even though the equations found do not reflect the game maker's approach at all. See the table above for details\n\n3) The average footballer in FIFA 20 is of 25 years of age, stands just above 180cm, weighs around 75kg, and has a overall rating of 66-ish. He is right-footed, has a weak foot rating of 3, and skill moves rating of 2.\n\n4) \"shooting\"&\"dribbling\" are very closely related to each other - \"passing\"&\"dribbling\" too. The goalkeeper attributes are very closely related to each other and many of them are almost directly related to overall rating.\n\n5) In FIFA 20, the gap between the very top players and 75th percentile is much greater than that of between 75th percentile and median-ish players, at least in terms of numbers. Attributes \"pace\" and \"physic\" do not vary much though.\n\n6) Based on the 2018-19 season, EPL has the edge over all the other major European leagues when it comes to overall ratings. The weakest among the major five is Ligue 1. At the very pinnacle, however, the Spanish La Liga has the edge, and that is the case for market value and weekly wage. Overall the Bundesligans are the youngest and the tallest. The greatest weekly wage gap is seen in La Liga - the least, Ligue 1. For more refer to above.\n\n7) Based on the 2018-19 season, the top 10 world's most valuable clubs were, in the following order: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Tottenham, Atletico Madrid, Dortmund. \n\nThe top 10 highest-paying clubs were the following: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nLastly, the top 10 strongest clubs (based solely on average overall rating of top 15 players for each) in the same season have been the following: Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool, Tottenham, Dortmund, Atletico Madrid.\n\n8) The top 5 strongest national teams come from Spain, Brazil, France, Germany, and Belgium. The top 5 most valuable national teams come from France, Brazil, Germany, Belgium, and Argentina.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Although I did not quite follow my initial curiosity-driving question I believe I still ended up with some interesting and meaningful insights, most of which requires some wrangling with this particular type of dataset. I think I am most satistied with the linear models I found in the beginning, as they are incredibly well-performing and offer something that cannot be found anywhere else. It's been a fruitful project overall and I had fun exploring it.\n\nThere's room for improvement and I would be happy to develop even further in the future, maybe for FIFA 21. A wonderful dashboard and maybe some other advanced ML algorithms could bring the project to another level...\n\nThe biggest challenge for me was figuring out what to ask and how to go about approaching what I'd like to know. With limited knowledge I was forced to search the web many times and educate myself with some knowledge concering the dataset and football in general. What's more, football is such a complex sport and there's so many variables that come into play, and this makes coming up with \"meaningful\" and \"accurate\" insights and findings to be rather demanding. Now I definitely understand why \"domain knowledge\" and \"business insights\" are deemed critical in data science...\n\nAnyways, this has been an amateur football fan's journey of storytelling football with data, and if you've been reading the whole thing, thank you very much!
