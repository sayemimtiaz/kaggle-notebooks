This fully-developed tool will be for open use and knowledge discovery, but we also intend to use it as the basis of our Round 2 submission.\n\nEven so we do provide here sets of queries and outputs (the results of performing “low-level” queries against out Graph directly) for a subset of the Round 1 questions, which we believe show very promising results.\n\nSince the code behind the Graph creation process, its deployment, etc., is much too involved for a Notebook context, we will instead outline our methodology descriptively. Query code however is provided later in this Notebook.\n\n## Document Processing\n\nWe'll say a little here about the creation of our Graph with respect to its two phases: First, document processing, consisting of a custom spaCy/SciSpacy pipeline - and second a bulk insert into our Amazon Neptune instance.\n\n### SciSpacy and UMLS\n\nInitial parsing of the Kaggle Challenge source data was done using [SciSpacy](http://https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) (a Python package containing spaCy models for processing biomedical, scientific or clinical text). We also used the SciSpacy UMLS Named Entity Linker, to link the entities found by its NER to a Knowledge Base consisting of UMLS ([Unified Medical Language System](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls)) Concepts.\n\nBesides SciSpacy, we customised our pipeline to enrich documents with some additional information.\n\n### Custom COVID-19 Entity Recognition\n\nSince COVID-19 is a new disease, and lacks an entry in the UMLS, it isn't linked by the SciSpacy Linker. Hence we created an additional NER dedicated to recognising mentions of COVID-19. This was added to the pipeline *prior to* the SciSpacy NER, to prevent the latter incorrectly identifying COVID-19 an existing UMLS concept. We then linked these to a Concept ID from the [Supplementary Concept Record for Coronavirus Disease 2019](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/jf20/brief/jf20_mesh_novel_coronavirus_disease.html) newly issued by MeSH, allowing for them to be queried much as any other UMLS Concept. The result of the Document Processing phase is a large [Neptune CSV format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load-tutorial-format-gremlin.html) file, ready for bulk insert in Amazon Neptune. \n\n## Amazon Neptune and Gremlin\n\nOnce loaded, the dataset is initially represented in the Graph as entities-within-sentences-within-sections, roughly as follows:\n\n- Document  - \n  - Title\n    - Sentence<sub>1</sub>\n      - Entity<sub>1</sub>\n      - ...\n      - Entity<sub>n</sub>\n    - ...\n    - Sentence<sub>n</sub>\n  - Abstract\n    - (As Title)\n  - Full Text\n    - (As Title) \n  \n\nSince our Graph instance is under Neptune, it uses the Gremlin query language. Hence all code examples below are written in Gremlin.\n\n### The UMLS Semantic Network\n\nOnce hosted, we further enriched our Graph with the structure (in addition to the Concepts, that is) behind the [Unified Medical Language System](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html) (UMLS).\n\nEach Entity found during the NLP phase is linked, via an `instance_of edge` to a) one `EntityType` and b) one or more  `SemanticType` Vertices, meaning every `Entity` is given its place within the structure of the [UMLS Taxonomy](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/META3_current_semantic_types.html). From there, we linked the `SemanticType` Vertex with any corresponding relationships mentioned in the [UMLS Semantic Network](https://semanticnetwork.nlm.nih.gov/). This allows us to query our documents according to that network too. For example, to find `Entities` in our the dataset that, say, are the *types of things* (Bodily Organs, for example) that produce a Body Substance, we can issue this query:\n\n```python\ng.V().out('entity').where(out('instance_of').hasLabel('SemanticType').out('produces').has('name','Body Substance')).\n```\n\nTo find ones (e.g. \"child\", \"Adults\") that represent Age Groups:\n\n```python\ng.V().out('entity').where(out('instance_of').hasLabel('SemanticType').in('isa').has('name','Age Group')).\n```\n\n## Pros and Cons\n\n### Pros\n\n- Our solution is extremely powerful, allowing queries to exploit the rich structure of the UMLS network.\n- Queries can output arbitrary numbers of columns and normalised data types, and can return raw UMLS codes instead of text. Hence our approach can turn free-text into structured data directly.\n  \n### Cons\n\n- The power mentioned in the Pros section has the downside of requiring a user familiarise themselves with the Gremlin query language, and the structure of the UMLS Semantic Network. This makes query development much slower and more iterative than more user-friendly search-box solutions. \n- We are currently using an early version of the Kaggle dataset with 13K documents only.\n- While not a Con of the approach itself, our Graph currently lacks co-reference resolution, which likely harms recall significantly. Take the sentence \"**COVID-19** is a disease. It is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2\". Since \"It\" is not recognised as a UMLS Concept, the valuable information in the the second sentence would be missed by queries. So we plan to add co-reference resolution, along with the abovementioned improvements, for our Round 2 submission, and copy any Concept information from \"COVID-19\" to the \"It\".\n  \n\nThe remainder of the Notebook contains our queries and outputs for selected Task questions."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Utilities to display results.\n\nfrom IPython.core.display import display, HTML\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pandas as pd\nimport ast\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', -1)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)\n\ndef format_cell(value):\n    \n    if type(value) is list:\n        children=[format_cell(child) for child in value]\n        value='; '.join(map(str,value))\n    if type(value) is dict:\n        children=[f'{format_cell(k)}={format_cell(v)}' for k,v in value.items()]\n        value='; '.join(children)\n                  \n        \n    return str(value)\n    \n\ndef show_results(filename):\n    path=Path(f'/kaggle/input/queryoutputs/{filename}.txt')\n    line_dicts=[ast.literal_eval(line.strip()) for line in path.read_text(encoding='utf-8').splitlines()]\n    df=pd.DataFrame(line_dicts)\n    for column in df.columns:\n        df[column]=df[column].apply(format_cell)\n    return df\n    \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prevalence of asymptomatic shedding and transmission (e.g., particularly children).\n\nQuery finds the UMLS concepts pertaining to Viral Shedding and Asymptomatic Infection in the same context as those for COVID-19.
