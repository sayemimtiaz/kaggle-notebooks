Also, check for any outliers by analysing the distribution graphs. \n\n* Now with the help of NLP library **\"NLTK\"**, first **remove the punctuation** and **special symbols** from all the SMS and then **lower case** them. You can even **tokenize** each SMS into sentences and words after removing punctuation & special symbols. Here I am just splitting each SMS into words with white spaces. However, tokenization and parsing may be the best idea to split the texts. Please note that converting all the data to lower case helps in the process of preprocessing and in later stages in the NLP application.\n\n* Then remove the **Stopswords** from all the SMS.\n\n* After processing each SMS, we will create the **WordCloud** for Spam and Ham messages for the visual representation of widely used words in both Spam and Ham messages.\n\n* Now we can normalize the text by NLTK **lemmatization** or **stemming** or distinguishing by **part of speech (POC)**. However, sometimes these methods don't work well especially for text-messages due to the way a lot of people tend to use abbreviations or shorthand in SMS. E.g. \"IDK\" for \"I don't know\" or \"wut\" for \"what\". So we will not process the text by these methods.\n\n* For now, we will have the messages as lists of tokens and now we need to convert each of these messages into a vector so that SciKit Learn's algorithm models can work with.\n\n    We'll do that in three steps using the **bag-of-words (BOW)** model:\n    \n\n    * Count how many times does a word occur in each message (Known as term frequency - **TF**)\n    \n    * Weigh the counts, so that frequent tokens get lower weight (inverse document frequency - **IDF**)\n    \n    * Normalize the vectors to unit length, to abstract from the original text length (L2 norm)\n    \n\n\n* Once the messages represented as vectors, we can finally train our spam/ham classifier.
