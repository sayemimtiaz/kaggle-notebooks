This notebook follows the general methodology of the lesson 1 notebook (available [here](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson1-pets.ipynb)). In this notebook, we will be developing a deep learning model to identify German traffic signs.\n\nWe will begin by loading in the provided training data into a FastAI 'ImageDataBunch' object. We will make use of the dataset in the provided training set folder, randomly extracting 10% of it to be used for a validation set, and setting the batch size to 64 and the image size to 224x224. These images will also be normalized using the FastAI 'imagenet_stats' object, and augmented using the 'get_transforms' FastAI object."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_path = Path(\"/kaggle/input/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/\")\ndata = ImageDataBunch.from_folder(data_path/\"train\",\n                                  ds_tfms=get_transforms(do_flip=False),\n                                  size=224,\n                                  bs=64,\n                                  valid_pct=0.1,\n                                  seed=0).normalize(imagenet_stats)\ndata","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at some of these images with their associated labels."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.show_batch(rows=3, figsize=(7,6))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Viewing the above sample images, we can see that these photos are really quite fuzzy.
