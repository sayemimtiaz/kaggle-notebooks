First I will talk a bit about what Expected Goals is.\n\nExpected Goals Models are an attempt to quantify how likely it is that a certain shot results in a goal. With this metric, we can analyze what happened in a game other than how many goals each team scored. Since the game is won with goals, and goals come only from shots (except for the rare case of an own goal), then the xG metric only needs data from shots to be developed. In other words, anything else that may influence how many \"expected goals\" a team would score has to happen via having more shots in the first place. For example, one could argue that if team B receives 3 red cards, then team A is supposed to score more goals (an increase in expected goals). However, in reality, having 3 more players on the field will result in taking more (and possibly better) shots, and it is taking more shots that will result in an increase in expected goals. Therefore, shots and their information are the only thing we need to take into account!\n\nI believe that an xG Model should not take into account specific characteristics or skills of the players who intervene in the event. I've read in some other places that xG models should account for this to be more accurate, but I strongly disagree. Of course that if Messi is one-on-one with the goalkeeper the chances of it being a goal are higher than with any other player. Or if Manuel Neuer is the goalkeeper then the probability of it being a goal may go down. But that is not the point of the metric. We are trying to standardize through thousands of datapoints how likely it is that any given player would score from a certain position in a certain situation. If the player is an extraordinary finisher, then he will probably score more goals than expected, and that's fine. If we start taking into account the skills of the players involved, it is my opinion that we would be taking one step too far towards the design of this metric and would become less meaningful.\n\nAfter this (long) introduction, let's prepare X and Y sets. Y will simply include every shot in the database and whether it was a goal or not (1 or 0). It is our target variable. X will include all the relevant information about the shot that we have in our data. That would be:\n\n. **location:** attacking half, defensive half, centre of the box, left wing, right wing, difficult angle and long range, difficult angle on the left, difficult angle on the right, left side of the box, left side of the six yard box, right side of the box, right side of the six yard box, very close range, penalty spot, outside the box, long range, more than 35 yards, more than 40 yards, not recorded.\n\n. **bodypart:** right foot, left foot, head.\n\n. **assist_method:** none, pass, cross, headed pass, through ball.\n\n. **situation:** open play, set piece, corner, free kick.\n\n. **fast_break:** 1 or 0, whether the shot comes from a fast break or not.\n\nSo, we have a lot of meaningful information about every shot. The location from which it was taken, which part of the body was used for shooting, how the shoot was made available (after a pass? a cross? etc.), and the situation or context in which the shoot occured (open play, corner, etc.)\n\nSince all of these are categorical variables, we have to convert them to binary dummies (except for fast_break, which is already binary)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.get_dummies(shots.iloc[:,-8:-3], columns=['location', 'bodypart','assist_method', 'situation'])\ndata.columns = ['fast_break', 'loc_centre_box', 'loc_diff_angle_lr', 'diff_angle_left', 'diff_angle_right',\n                'left_side_box', 'left_side_6ybox', 'right_side_box', 'right_side_6ybox', 'close_range',\n                'penalty', 'outside_box', 'long_range', 'more_35y', 'more_40y', 'not_recorded', 'right_foot', \n                'left_foot', 'header', 'no_assist', 'assist_pass', 'assist_cross', 'assist_header',\n                'assist_through_ball', 'open_play', 'set_piece', 'corner', 'free_kick']\ndata['is_goal'] = shots['is_goal']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(len(data))\nprint(data.is_goal.sum())\nprint(len(data.columns)-1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So we have a total of 229,135 shots, of which 24,441 were goals.

I will use 65% of them for training our model and 35% por testing it. This is because we have enough datapoints, so 65% should be enough to train it properly and I'd rather have as many shots left as possible for pure testing later.

In Section 4 we will see that our model results in a correlation of **0.97** between the total expected goals and the actual goals by player, suggesting that the model may be sufficiently good, but this measure is also not ideal.\n\nWhile searching for other xG models and how well they've done, to be able to compare how good this is, I found the following regarding AUC-ROC in other models (see [here](http://business-analytic.co.uk/blog/assessing-expected-goals-models-part-2-anatomy-of-a-big-chance/)):\n\n.

How much defensive pressure is the shooting player withstanding? How much time/space does the player have in order to shoot?\nI imagine the (quantified) answers to many of these questions could give the model interesting new information to base its predictions on.\n\nAdditionally, we have the *location* of the shot divided in 17 different categories.
