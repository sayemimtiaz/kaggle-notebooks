In fact, today the machines can analyze more language-based data than humans, without fatigue and in a consistent, unbiased way ([Sas Insight](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp.html#close)). And is possible to see in the projects of this topics that those tools are increasing and developing awesome applications. One field (or first steps) of this is the sentiment analysis and the build of any classification model. This way transforms large-scaled unstructured text data into structured and quantitative measurements to be able to identify if the sentiment behind a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. \n\nIn the other hand, The Last of Us Part II is the 2nd best game and the most discussed last year ([Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-last-of-us-part-ii)) having a lot of different opinions. Certainly i was surprised with the level of divergence caused by this video-game: very positive and very negative reviews. If you visit the above web-page, you can see a large number of user's reviews and a weird distribution in the user's score. So, does it exist a way to analyze it in depth? why the bad reviews are very bad reviews? and why the good reviews are very good reviews?  At this oportunity, i tried to find a classification model using the reviews of that web-page.\n\nFirst of all, let's look at how the game was presented:  (more info in [PlaystationStore](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/)) \n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">  \nFive years after their dangerous journey across the post-pandemic United States, Ellie and Joel have settled down in Jackson, Wyoming. Living amongst a thriving community of survivors has allowed them peace and stability, despite the constant threat of the infected and other, more desperate survivors. When a violent event disrupts that peace, Ellie embarks on a relentless journey to carry out justice and find closure. As she hunts those responsible one by one, she is confronted with the devastating physical and emotional repercussions of her actions.\n    <ul>\n    <li>A complex and emotional story</li>\n<li>Tense and desperate action-survival gameplay</li>\n<li>A beautiful yet dangerous world</li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n\nInteresting. The continuation of one of the best PS4 video-games with a promising story being ellie a more complex character. And no less important, a post pandemic story in this times (well in its release). Personally, that game was great for me, it was very realistic and it has incredible graphics. However, all users don't agree. On this other side, some persons hate this game, they says it has a bad story, the characters doesn't have sense and more... and I understand that point of view too but not in a extreme case. \n\nAnyway, the opinions are very different and is a challenge to propose any model. Also, is possible define an interactive dashboard or app, surely I'll add this in an update. For the first case, i want to have something like the next gif with a good prediction power. So, let's get started.\n\nPd: Obviously, this work contains spoilers. If you don't know the story of the Last of Us (mainly the first game). Go to play!\n\n![sgif!](https://coinerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Can-We-Represent-Emotions-Using-Machine-Learning.gif)\n\n-- --\nHello everybody! 👋 Welcome to this starter notebook. At this oportunity I only used the user reviews for the second game. The kaggle dataset contain reviews about all saga and you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lazaro97/the-last-of-us-reviews). About the recollection, this was obtained through web scraping, more info [here](https://github.com/Lazaro-97/Web-Scraping-Project).
