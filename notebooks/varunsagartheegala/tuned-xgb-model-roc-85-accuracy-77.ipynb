Successful cross selling efforts could also strengthen the brand’s image and position in the Insurance market. \n\n**ISSUE to address**: Health Insurances are considered by many as one of the most important financial covers any individual or household can possess at the time of an untimely medical condition or accident, due to which it has been one of the top selling insurances for many years now. However, in the past few years, Auto Insurance has slowly made its name as the most profitable insurance sold in the market owing to increasing no of vehicle owners and raising awareness of the benefits offered by vehicle insurances, to cover expensive repairs or damages due to accidents. However, searching for prospective insurance buyers could be a very laborious and costly process for any company.\n\n**APPROACH to solve the Issue**: An approach to achieve this would be to use the records of all existing Health Insurance holders, including those who also have an Auto Insurance, perform a detailed analysis and use Machine Learning to create a predictive model that could identify which Health Insurance holders could be potential Vehicle Insurance buyers based on their profile.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Variable Description","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- id: Unique ID for the customer\n\n- Gender: Gender of the customer\n\n- Age:\tAge of the customer\n\n- Driving_License:\t0 : Customer does not have DL, 1 : Customer already has DL\n\n- Region_Code:\tUnique code for the region of the customer\n\n- Previously_Insured:\t1 : Customer already has Vehicle Insurance, 0 : Customer doesn't have Vehicle Insurance\n\n- Vehicle_Age:\tAge of the Vehicle\n\n- Vehicle_Damage:\t1 : Customer got his/her vehicle damaged in the past. 0 : Customer didn't get his/her vehicle damaged in the past.\n\n- Annual_Premium:\tThe amount customer needs to pay as premium in the year\n\n- PolicySalesChannel:\tAnonymized Code for the channel of outreaching to the customer ie.

number of holders also found to be in the range of 40-50 years. However, due to a slightly bi-model appearance, we can say the median age of insurance holders in this dataset\nis around 36 years.\n- Median Premium most health insurance holders pay per annum is around 31000.\n- In respect to vintage, the no. of insurance holders who have held the insurance for a specific period are more or less uniform or identical.

\n\nFor numerical features:\n- In terms of age, there appears to be a significant difference the means of people with and without vehicle insurance. The median age of non insurance holders appears to be around 35 whereas those with insurance appear to be around 42-44.\n- In terms of Annual Premium, graphically, we dont see any difference in the median distributions of those with insurance and without insurance and they look identical. The median premiums paid for both groups are around 30-33K. Since our data samples are not normal for annual premium we went with mann-whitney u test to test for difference in medians.\n- In terms of days spent / Vintage, we again see no difference in the distributions for those with and without vehicle insurance. Due to uniform distributions, the median days spent for both is around 154.\n- Based on statistical analysis on to test for significant difference in means or median, it was observed that Vintage and Annual Premium were numerical features for which p > 0.05, hence we could conclude that there is no difference in average/ medians value of those with and without insurance. Hence, we can exclude Vintage and Annual Premium from our analysis later.\n\n\nFor categorical features:\n- We can see that all those who have a driving licence actually took the vehicle insurance. However, based on analysis of unique values, we also observed that the proportion of those who didn have a driving license is negligible. There is hardly any variance in terms of the categories and the predictions will always be biased towards the ones with license. Hence, it will be removed.\n- We can also observe that those who already have a vehicle insurance didnt take another vehicle insurance.\n- Majority of those who took the vehicle insurance have vehicles which are 1-2 years old.\n- Almost all those who did take a vehicle insurance had actually suffered damages to their vehicles in the past.\n- Most of those who took vehicle insurance were sold insurance through sales channel 26 and 124.\n- Majority of those who took vehicle insurance were from region coded 28.\n- Based on the statistical analysis to check dependency of target feature on a predictor, we found that p < 0.05 for all pairs of categorical features and target classes.

interpretation of the model and busines interpretation.\n- Based on the bivariate analysis of categorical features and the trends in respect to target classes , we can conclude that using tree based algorithms would work well.\n- Also due to presence of more than 380K records, a knn model would computationally take a large amount of time to run as it would have to calculate distance of 1 records with all other records in training and repeat that process again and again. \nHence we won't consider a KNN Model during model building.\n- Hence we will focus mainly on tree based algorithms during

to treat them. However, if models do stuggle, we can consider it as a means of improvment.\n- The only numerical feature in the dataset i.e age, doesnt seem to have any outliers.\n- Since we don't have any missing values, no need for missing value treatment.\n- The only need is to encode the categorical features.\n\nImportant Points about Encoding:\n- Except region and sales policy, all other features can be one hot encoded as they have only around 2-3 unique categories.\n- As region code and sales channel policy have more than 50 unique categories, we cannot encode them directly.\n- Target and frequency encoding is not appropriate as it won't help in any logical interpretation.\n- Label encoding is not possible as we don't have any logical order in the above two categorical features.\n- Hence, we need to try to one hot encode them. However, one hot encoding we will create n number of addition columns, where n is the no. of unique categories in the variable, which will lead to curse of dimensionality.\n- To prevent that, we will group together all categories which contribute less than 2% to the total records in the dataset under the category \"others\".","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Region_Dict = {}\nfor i,a

and f1 score on test was recorded around 0.424-0.426\n- The naive bayes model generalized better and provided the most consistent results, based on lowest deviation of 0.01%  compared to the 2-3% deviation of tree models.\n- However, naive bayes model doesnt have much scope for improvement in terms of parameters to tune and it produced very low precision for class 1 on test data i.e 0.29 compared to recall of 0.89. \n- In this respect, tree models performed better with slightly lesser difference in recall and precision scores in test sample. Hence we would choose a tree based model.\n- Since, decision tree was giving a lower deviation in scores, lesser complex to tune and less time consuming due to being a standalone estimator, we chose the decision tree for further tuning.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature Selection","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"results_features =

These features can be the key focus points for salesmen or the organization to target when trying to identify potential vehicle insurance holders. The features were based on whether a health insurance holder - \n     - 1 Had a car which had been damaged before or not.\n     - 2 Age of the holder.\n     - 3 Had a vehicle that was not insured or not.\n     - 4 Was a male or female\n     - 5 Belonged to the regions coded 28, 152 or 8.\n     - 6 Was approached by policy sales channel 152 or 160.\n     - 7 Had a vehicle that was around 1-2 years old.\n     \n     \n- Based on the chosen features and optimal parameters the final model produced a train f1 score of 0.75 during training phase and scored a f1 score of 0.45 during test. The model was very reliable and produced consistent results, based on a deviation in f1 scores across several test samples calculated to only 0.5%.\n\n\n- During the testing phase, the model was able to identify close to 80% of the potential vehicle insurance holders in the sample.\n\n\nHowever, **the model suffered from the following drawbacks** - \n- There was a huge difference in the test and train scores of the model indicating underfitting, which was a problem across almost all models created and tried due to the heavy imbalance in instances of health insurance holders who purchased vehicle insurance and those who did not.\n\n\n- As a result, the learning of potential vehicle insurance holders was not robust during training.\n\n\n- Oversampling for these class of customers in the train sample, we found that our results during the test phase had increased significantly\n\n\n- However, while the scores during the test phase had improved significantly, there was still huge difference in the train and test results.\n\n\n- As oversampling of minority class was not done in test, the models found it difficult to identify such records and as a result, was more biased in predictions towards those insurance holders who didnt buy a vehicle insurance.\n\n**Suggestions** -\n\n- To improve the model in the near future, more instances of health and vehicle insurance holders can be added to the data in order to retrain the model and get better results during test phase.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
