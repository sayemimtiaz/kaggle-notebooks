As a novice, this makes them easy to pick up and use. However, pandas has its own accessor operators, `loc` and `iloc`. For more advanced operations, these are the ones you're supposed to be using.\n\n### Index-based selection\n\nPandas indexing works in one of two paradigms. The first is **index-based selection**: selecting data based on its numerical position in the data. `iloc` follows this paradigm.\n\nTo select the first row of data in a DataFrame, we may use the following:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews.iloc[0]","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Both `loc` and `iloc` are row-first, column-second.

To get a column with `iloc`, we can do the following:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews.iloc[:, 0]","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On its own, the `:` operator, which also comes from native Python, means \"everything\".

In this paradigm, it's the data index value, not its position, which matters.\n\nFor example, to get the first entry in `reviews`, we would now do the following:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews.loc[0, 'country']","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`iloc` is conceptually simpler than `loc` because it ignores the dataset's indices. When we use `iloc` we treat the dataset like a big matrix (a list of lists), one that we have to index into by position. `loc`, by contrast, uses the information in the indices to do its work. Since your dataset usually has meaningful indices, it's usually easier to do things using `loc` instead. For example, here's one operation that's much easier using `loc`:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews.loc[:, ['taster_name', 'taster_twitter_handle', 'points']]","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Choosing between `loc` and `iloc`\n\nWhen choosing or transitioning between `loc` and `iloc`, there is one \"gotcha\" worth keeping in mind, which is that the two methods use slightly different indexing schemes.\n\n`iloc` uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\nWhy the change? Remember that loc can index any stdlib type: strings, for example. If we have a DataFrame with index values `Apples, ..., Potatoes, ...`, and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a lot more convenient to index `df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes']` than it is to index something like `df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet']` (`t` coming after `s` in the alphabet).\n\nThis is particularly confusing when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `loc`, you will need to go one lower and ask for `df.loc[0:999]`. \n\nOtherwise, the semantics of using `loc` are the same as those for `iloc`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Manipulating the index\n\nLabel-based selection derives its power from the labels in the index.
