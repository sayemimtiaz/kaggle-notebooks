This kernal will take the next step and use probabilities to predict profitable bets for future events.\n\n### What is the Difference?\n\nTaking a look at the upcoming fights we have a match between Amanda Ribas and Paige VanZant.  Amanda Rebas has American betting odds of -835.  This means you would need to bet 835 units to receive a return of 100 units on a winning bet.  To determine what percentage of time Amanda Rebas must win for this to be a profitable bet we use the following formula:\n\n`(Payout on 100 Unit Bet) * (Break Even win probability) - 100 * (1 - Break Even win probability) = 0`\n\n`((100 / 835) * 100) * x - 100 * (1 - x) = 0`\n\n`11.97 * x - 100 + 100*x = 0`\n\n`111.97x = 100`\n\n`x = .893`\n\nAmanda Rebas must win at least 89.3% of the time for this bet to be profitable.\n(89.3% of the time you win 11.97 units.  10.7% of the time you lose 100 units. .893 * 11.97 - .107 * 100 ~= 0)\n\nAmanda Rebas simply being predicted to win the fight isn't enough.  We need to know that she has around a 90% chance to win to want to bet her.  I'd go as far to say that any model that doesn't predict Amanda Rebas to be the winner based off of a 50% threshold is probably a flawed model.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Method of Acquiring and Implementing Probabilites\n\nLuckily for us many machine learning models have probabilities built in.
