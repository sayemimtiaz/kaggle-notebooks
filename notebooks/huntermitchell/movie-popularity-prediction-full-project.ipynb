This could be useful for film companies to determine what factors into a movie's popularity, or for other content creators to better understand their audience.\n\nThe data I am using is obtained from a Kaggle dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). I encourage anyone to explore the data for themselves and predict other potentially useful imformation (revenue, rating, etc.) \n\nWe must also verify four main assumptions to get valid results from Linear Regression. These are:\n\n1.   Linearity between features and target\n2.   Multivariate normality\n3.   Little multicollinearity\n4.

However, these scores show how much room we still have for improvement. Although 0.84393 is a good score, it still has a bit to go before being a great model. We can also see that our original Lasso Regression model, and our Neural Network fit the data pretty terribly. We were able to improve the Lasso model through grid search, but we will need to experiment quite a bit with Neural Networks to make it more accurate.

I am confident that with more hyperparameter tuning and ensembling, we could achieve a much better RMSE and $R^2$ score. There are also many other models and methods we could try that are outside the scope of this project. I would like to work with on this further in the future with more data. I would also like to predict other things such as revenue or ratings, and try different feature combinations. Overall, this project gave a lot of insight into what increases the popularity of movies. I think it could be useful for production companies or independent filmmakers. I also personally learned a lot doing this and look forward to working on more complex projects in the future!
