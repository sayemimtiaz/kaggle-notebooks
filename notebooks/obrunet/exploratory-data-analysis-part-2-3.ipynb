In this 2nd part we're going to analyse and explore datas for one country representative of each cluster. As a reminder, here are what those 6 clusters made of :\n- cluster nb : 0 CY IE NO SE\n- cluster nb : 1 AT CH CZ HR HU IT SI SK\n- cluster nb : 2 BE DE DK FR LU NL UK  \n- cluster nb : 3 EE FI LT LV PL\n- cluster nb : 4 BG EL RO \n- cluster nb : 5 ES PT\n\n## Goals\n\n- Assess the impact of meteorological and climate variability on the generation of solar power in Europe.\n- Understand how the datas are structured\n- Determine how clean is the dataset? Older solar estimates used to contain impossible values around sunset (ie more energy than the sun releases) or negative sunlight.\n- Show what does a typical year look like? One common approach is to stitch together 12 months of raw data, using the 12 most typical months per this ISO standard.\n\n## First look\n\nLet's see the first rows of our data set :"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\npd.options.display.max_columns = 300\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\ndf_solar_co = pd.read_csv(\"../input/30-years-of-european-solar-generation/EMHIRESPV_TSh_CF_Country_19862015.csv\")\ndf_solar_co.head(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We keep only one country of each cluster, and take a look a the end of the data set :"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_solar_co = df_solar_co[['NO', 'AT', 'FR', 'FI', 'RO', 'ES']]\ndf_solar_co.tail(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data cleaning and preparation\n\nUntil now we've consider that all datas are clean and \"normal\", but is it really the case ?
