Introduction \n\nWe estimate the number of actually new symptomatic cases of COVID-19 per day in the region. The median time from infection to confirmation of the diagnosis can be estimated as the sum of the median time of the incubation time and the test time. The median incubation period is 5 days [3]. The median test time varies between 0 and 4 depending on the region. The number of actual new symptomatic cases correlates with a number of confirmed cases 5, 6 or 7 days later.\n\nAccording to statistics, the median time from infection to death was estimated to be 19 to 20 days [1, 2]. The number of actually new symptomatic cases correlates with a number of confirmed cases 17 to 20 days later.\n\nWe use the **adjustable coefficient d_rate to calibrate the number of actual new symptomatic cases that are estimated from the death statistics.** D_rate depends on the country, stage of the epidemic, the lack of medical resources and the age distribution of the patients [4]. D_rate correlates with mortality rate and case fatality rate. We also assume three simplifications\n1. Assumption. d_rate in a particular region is the same and does not change over time.\n2. Assumption. The proportion of risk groups in a particular region is the same and does not change over time.\n3. Assumption. Herd immunity does not change over time.\n \n\n### 1.1 Study Limitations\n\n**Assumptions.**\n\nCOVID-19 can proceed without symptoms (asympomatic) or in a mild form. It was found that 16-50% of Diamond Princess passengers tested from February 15 to 19, 2020 were asymptomatic and 33% of Japanese citizens were evacuated from Wuhan [5, 6] were asymptomatic. This rate is much higher for children. So our **estimates can be multiplied by 1.2-3** to estimate the number of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases.\n\n\nLiterature\n1. Wang D. et al.
