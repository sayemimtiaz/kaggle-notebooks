To paint the picture in, we need to understand how variables interact with one another. Does an increase in one variable correlate with an increase in another? Does it relate to a decrease somewhere else?

Five different types of wine is a good number because it keeps the result interpretable; eight is sometimes mentioned as a suggested upper bound. Many dataset fields will not fit this critereon naturally, so you have to \"make do\", as here, by selecting a group of interest.\n\nThe second limitation is one of interpretability. As easy as they are to make, and as pretty as they look, stacked plots make it really hard to distinguish concrete values.
