Kublai Khan’s attempted conquest of Japan failed terribly when the invasion fleet was wiped out by a typhoon. Over the years, the role of weather becomes more significant with the invention of heavy armours vehicles brought to battle. Land and sea invasions were heavily dependent on the weather as bombers and air-strikes have to be aborted during bad weather conditions. Meteorologists in the 1940s also lacked modern devices like satelite imagery devices to forcast weather predictions days in advance. This means that sea convoys are heavily dependent on to gather valuable meteorological data.\n\nIn this dataset, we analyse the aerial bombing operations dataset which explore the weather condition during the D-Day landing.
