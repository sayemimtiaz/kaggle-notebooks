A clustering analysis:\nFor this project I found an extremely interesting dataset on Kaggle which is a survey of young people with a wide range of variables(150 of them to be precise) from movie tastes to health habits.  I will be performing a clustering analysis to group people based on a number of variables and finally label them myself based on my intuition. This is my first clustering project and I hope to gain a deeper understanding on clustering. I personally find this dataset very interesting because there is such a wide, interesting collection of variables which lets me choose  variables and customize the analysis to my liking and proceed from there. This is my first clustering analysis! So any input is appreciated.\n\n## The data:\nIn 2013, students of the Statistics class at FSEV UK were asked to invite their friends to\nparticipate in this survey.\n\nThe data file (responses.csv) consists of 1010 rows and 150 columns (139\ninteger and 11 categorical).\nFor convenience, the original variable names were shortened in the\ndata file. See the columns.csv file if you want to match the data with the original names.\nThe data contain missing values.\nThe survey was presented to participants in both electronic and written form.\nThe original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated\ninto English.\nAll participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.\nThe variables can be split into the following groups:\n\nMusic preferences (19 items)\n\nMovie preferences (12 items)\n\nHobbies & interests (32 items)\n\nPhobias (10 items)\n\nHealth habits (3 items)\n\nPersonality traits, views on life, & opinions (57 items)\n\nSpending habits (7 items)\n\nDemographics (10 items)\n\n## The Questions:\nThese are the questions in the survey I have decided to pursue with in my analysis:\nMOVIE PREFERENCES\n1.

There is much to be improved on and much left wanted. However, it has been a learning experience for me as this is my first time doing a clustering analysis. Now that I have completed the project I better understand how clusterin works and how clustering doesn't( I believe I personally learnt a bit more of the latter in this case). It is also sometimes said clustering is not suitable for categorical variables and perhaps that could be a reason as well as to why it performed as given.\n Thank you for taking the time to go through this!","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
