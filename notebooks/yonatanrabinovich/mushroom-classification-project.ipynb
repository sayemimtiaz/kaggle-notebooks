Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like \"leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.\n\n## Breakdown of the Problem Statement:\n    \n* Supervised machine learning problem.\n* classification.\n* The target value will be `class`.\n\n## Aim of the Notebook:\n\nThe objective is to create a model that can predict edibility of the Mushroom based on its features.\n\n# Data Id 👨‍💻\n    \n## columns:\n\nThis dataset is named [Mushroom Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification).

powerful ensemble machine learning algorithm that uses decision trees.\nBoosting is a general ensemble technique that involves sequentially adding models to the ensemble where subsequent models correct the performance of prior models. AdaBoost was the first algorithm to deliver on the promise of boosting.([machinelearningmastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gradient-boosting-machine-ensemble-in-python/))."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#model\nXGB = XGBClassifier()\n#cross validation\nXGB_report = pd.DataFrame(cross_validate(XGB, X, y, scoring=scoring))\n#getting required score methods\nXGB_report = XGB_report.iloc[:,2:]\n#naming the columns\nXGB_report.columns = scoring\n#naming the index\nXGB_report.index = index\n\n#final result collection\nmodel_4 = []\n\n#Classification report\nprint(\"Clasification report:\\n\")\nprint(XGB_report,\"\\n\\n\")\nprint(\"Mean Scores:\\n\")\nfor score in scoring:\n    print(f\"\\t{score}: {round(XGB_report[score].mean(),4)}\")\n    model_4.append(round(XGB_report[score].mean(),4))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Csv results of the test for our model:\n<img src=\"https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/134487/screenshots/5947007/quickgif_2_excel_todribble.gif\" alt=\"excel\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\">\n\nFor an example a sample of the models prediction was created, You can see each predition and true value side by side by the csv created in the output directory.\nyou can try to calculate through excel the metrics that have been used in this notebook to enhance your understanding!\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#sample prediction for csv file\nXGB.fit(X_train, y_train)#training\ny_predict = XGB.predict(X_test)#predicting\nXGBoost=pd.DataFrame({'y_test':y_test,'prediction':y_predict})#df for camparison\nXGBoost.to_csv(\"XGBoost.csv\")#export to csv     ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Support Vector Machines\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1290/1*qYg3y4_Qaj00U7sMU_XlaQ.gif)\n\nIn machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine))."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#model\nSVM = SVC(kernel = 'linear')\n#cross validation\nSVM_report = pd.DataFrame(cross_validate(SVM, X, y, scoring=scoring))\n#getting required score methods\nSVM_report = SVM_report.iloc[:,2:]\n#naming the columns\nSVM_report.columns = scoring\n#naming the index\nSVM_report.index = index\n\n#final result collection\nmodel_5 = []\n\n#Classification report\nprint(\"Clasification report:\\n\")\nprint(SVM_report,\"\\n\\n\")\nprint(\"Mean Scores:\\n\")\nfor score in scoring:\n    print(f\"\\t{score}: {round(SVM_report[score].mean(),4)}\")\n    model_5.append(round(SVM_report[score].mean(),4))\n    \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Csv results of the test for our model:\n<img src=\"https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/134487/screenshots/5947007/quickgif_2_excel_todribble.gif\" alt=\"excel\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\">\n\nFor an example a sample of the models prediction was created, You can see each predition and true value side by side by the csv created in the output directory.\nyou can try to calculate through excel the metrics that have been used in this notebook to enhance your understanding!\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#sample prediction for csv file\nSVM.fit(X_train, y_train)#training\ny_predict = SVM.predict(X_test)#predicting\nSupport_Vector_Machines=pd.DataFrame({'y_test':y_test,'prediction':y_predict})#df for camparison\nSupport_Vector_Machines.to_csv(\"Support Vector Machines.csv\")#export to csv     ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# conclusion\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5637990ae4b079867b702d80/1544043440205-1W8A4YB11EKL4XI6UBFH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kM7hVlVBSZIBDiYFGm4uKL8UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dg-9TaKOIrgOcuDKbtfYF7NMOK5RvYUzVpIK_EiFkmZhCjLISwBs8eEdxAxTptZAUg/Balancing+Scale)\n\nAfter all of the models calculations, we can now compare them,\nwe will show them side by side and by our reports decide how well they performed compared to one another."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nModels = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Logistic Regression': np.array(model_1),\n    'Decision Tree': np.array(model_2),\n    'Random Forest': np.array(model_3),\n    'XGBoost': np.array(model_4),\n    'Support Vector Machines': np.array(model_5)})\nModels.index = scoring\n#Models.sort_values(by='Score', ascending=False)\nModels","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ranking:\n\n**accuracy** - 1.
