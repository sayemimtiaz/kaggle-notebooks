Conclusion\n    \n# Introducion\n    \n**Problem Statement:** \nA manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction\n\n**Breakdown of the Problem Statement:** \n\n* Supervised machine learning classification problem.\n* The target value will be `Attrition_Flag`.\n    \n**Aim of the NoteBook:**\n    \nCreate a model to predict what customer has a high risk of leaving the bank's credit card services.\n    \n![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/gj6va0A4XtMBqRmfsH/giphy.gif)\n\n# Data Id 📋\n    \n This dataset is named [Credit Card customers](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers).
