It is new and hasn't been detected in humans before, Corona is a Latin word for crown, the core of genetic material is enveloped in a protein that resembles the crown. As it was detected at the end of the year 2019, WHO named is as 2019-nCOV, COVID-19.\n\n## How does it spread?\nCOVID-19 is not airborne, it spreads from person to person through close contact or from droplets that are scattered when a person with the virus sneezes or coughs. According to the CDCTrusted Source, people who have the virus are most contagious when they’re showing symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n## Symptoms\nInfecting the respiratory system with symptoms including that of a common cold, caused by the rhinovirus, or, the flu caused by the influenza virus, There may also be aches and pains, fatigue and, in some cases, vomiting and diarrhoea, shortness of breath and it leads to respiratory complications like pneumonia.
