A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is not that same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.\n\nA diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a 2019-nCoV diagnosis. These are different viruses and patients with 2019-nCoV will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.\n\nPublic health officials and partners are working hard to identify the source of the 2019-nCoV. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats and bats. Analysis of the genetic tree of this virus is ongoing to know the specific source of the virus. SARS, another coronavirus that emerged to infect people, came from civet cats, while MERS, another coronavirus that emerged to infect people, came from camels. More information about the source and spread of 2019-nCoV is available on the 2019-nCoV Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.\n\nThis virus probably originally emerged from an animal source but now seems to be spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people. Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.\n\nReference: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### CSV operations"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"CSV stands for:\n\n+ C - Comma\n+ S - Separated\n+ V - Values\n\nThese are a very common file type that you will notice in data science."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use the Pandas function `read_csv()` to read in CSV files and load them as DataFrames in our workspace."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/covid_19_data.csv',parse_dates=['Last Update'])\ndf.rename(columns={'ObservationDate':'Date', 'Country/Region':'Country'}, inplace=True)\n\nconf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_confirmed.csv\")\nrecov = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_recovered.csv\")\ndeath = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/time_series_covid_19_deaths.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Preprocessing data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Preprocessing allows us to change the data; i.e drop some columns, rename columns, extract some columns etc."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have a pretty good template for data preprocessing:\n\n`\nin_df = in_df.rename(columns = {'SomeColumn': 'SomeOtherColumn'})\n`"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"conf.rename(columns={'Country/Region':'Country'}, inplace=True)\nrecov.rename(columns={'Country/Region':'Country'}, inplace=True)\ndeath.rename(columns={'Country/Region':'Country'}, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Inspecting data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can use the Pandas functions `df.head` and `df.tail`."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"conf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"death.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"recov.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Working with the data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's use an interactive barplot to see the cases of confirmed over time:"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=df['Date'],\n                y=df['Confirmed'],\n                name='Confirmed',\n                marker_color='blue'\n                ))\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title='Worldwide Corona Virus Cases - Confirmed(Bar Chart)',\n    xaxis_tickfont_size=14,\n    yaxis=dict(\n        title='Number of Cases',\n        titlefont_size=16,\n        tickfont_size=14,\n    )\n)\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=df['Date'],\n                y=df['Deaths'],\n                name='Deaths',\n                marker_color='red'\n                ))\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title='Worldwide Corona Virus Cases - Deaths(Bar Chart)',\n    xaxis_tickfont_size=14,\n    yaxis=dict(\n        title='Number of Cases',\n        titlefont_size=16,\n        tickfont_size=14,\n    )\n)\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## This is a work in progress.
