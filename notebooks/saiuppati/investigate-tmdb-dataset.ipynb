Though the original option for this movie metadata dataset was the IMDb one, it was since removed from Kaggle due to a DMCA takedown request. Kaggle has decided to compensate for the loss of the IMDb dataset with this one from TMDb. Please read more about this dataset and the change from the original at https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata. I hope this replacement dataset suffices for demonstration of my data exploration and analysis capabilities.\n\nPersonally, I quite enjoy watching movies. One of the genres I really enjoy is science fiction. I'm a big fan of several of the major releases under the Marvel Cinematic Universe banner such as Iron Man, Captain America, Dr. Strange, The Avengers series etc. I have a general sense that this sub-genre of 'superhero' movies are high-budget and typically high-grossing. But I haven't had an opportunity to explore a quantitative dataset like this to better understand what makes movies commercial successes.

Higher budget movies tend to have lower return on invesment than lower budget movies\n2.

Longer movies, i.e. movies with longer runtime, tend to do better commercially than shorter ones\n4. Genre doesn't seem to be a good indicator of whether a movie is well received and whether it performs well commercially\n5. Marvel movies tend to perform better commercially and have higher rating than DC comics movies as well as the average movie\n\nIt should be noted that these findings are simply correlations and simple comparisons. They do NOT indicate causation, e.g. higher budget doesn't necessary cause less profit. Typically a combination of factors will impact how well a movie does in terms of public reception and commercial success. More rigorous analysis and machine learning is required to predict which movies will end up doing well and which will do poorly."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
