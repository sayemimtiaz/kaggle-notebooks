As such, Kaggle is currently inundated with Covid-19 datsets and notebooks: so what makes this one any different?\n\nFor straters, this dataset is concerned with **Mexican Patient Pre-Condition Data**. My analysis will be focused on informative visualizations and building models that predict patient outcomes based on pre-conditions and other factors. I've come across many a great Kaggle notebook exploring Covid-19 data, but here are a few that I think are especially informative:\n* https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/covid-19-east-asia-europe-usa-and-rest\n* https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/covid-19-analysis-visualization-comparisons\n* https://www.kaggle.com/tarunkr/covid-19-case-study-analysis-viz-comparisons\n* https://www.kaggle.com/maksimeren/covid-19-literature-clustering\n\nI have to extend my sincerest thanks and gratitude to Tanmoy Mukherjee (https://www.kaggle.com/tanmoyx) for procuring such important data. I aim to repay his charitable hard work by producing an informative and helpful analysis. Also, I encourage you to check out the other notebooks associated with this dataset; some of my favorites are below:\n* https://www.kaggle.com/tanmoyx/covid-19-icu-requirement-prediction\n\nFinally, I encourage everyone to contribute to helping those affected by Covid-19.
