The most likely data to be misreported are those that would justify the use of deadly force; specifically, the armed column seems the most likely culprit.

Here are the following categories I've come up with:\n1. Gun \n2. Long-Range High-Threat Weapon (Crossbow, Nailgun, etc.)\n3. Short-Range High-Threat Weapon (Knife, Sword, Axe, etc.)\n4. Medium-Threat Weapon (Most Blunt Objects)\n5. Low-Threat Weapon (Weak Blunt Objects)\n6. Unknown Weapon (Not reported)\n7. Faux Weapon (Appeared to have a more dangerous weapon)\n8. Unarmed\n\nKeep in mind, these aren't definitive by any means (after all, I'm not a weapons expert). And it is also worth mentioning that the wielder of the weapon also has an influence on the threat level. But for now, I believe these distinctions capture the fact that not all weapons are created equal, especially when it comes to justifying the use of deadly force.
