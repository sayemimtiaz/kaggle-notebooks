I'm not the type of person who often finds themselves picking random mushrooms growing and eating them, but it be cool to know if there was a quick way to identify whether or not it be safe to eat. With that in mind, this kernel hopes to answer the question, \"are there any heuristics for identifying whether or not a mushroom is poisonous\"?\n\nLet's dig in!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\nmushrooms = pd.read_csv(\"../input/mushrooms.csv\")\n# Check the dataframe shape\nprint(\"Shape:\", mushrooms.shape, \"\\n\")\n\n# Check out the columns and data types\nprint(mushrooms.dtypes, \"\\n\\n\")\n\n# Look at the first few rows\nprint(mushrooms.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looks like we have 8124 observations with 23 columns, 22 of which are features of the mushroom and 1 being its classification (edible or poisonous). Each feature is **nominal**, meaning they are of discrete values with (seemingly) no numerical relationship between the different categories. I make this distinction because I feel it would be a mistake to immediately use sklearn's LabelEncoder, or something equivalent to it, to encode each column to some numeric values. This is because it would imply that one value is \"better\" than the other, aka veil-color yellow is \"greater than\" veil-color brown, without first anaylizing the data. I don't want to jump the gun and start convincing myself of trends in the data that only exist because I applied an artificial order to the values.\n\nNow then...\n\nThe first thing I want to do is get a better understanding of the data and make myself at home.
