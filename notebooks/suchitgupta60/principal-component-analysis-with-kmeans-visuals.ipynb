Some caveats : I will not be attempting to run any predictive models ( XGBoosting, SVM, Regression... that sort of thing). This notebook will purely be an exploratory and hopefully concise enough attempt to explain the idea of PCA as well as using a clustering method (KMeans) to extract meaningful relations out of it. \n\nA very high-level description of PCA is that it serves as a dimensionality reduction method on the features of our original dataset by projecting these features onto a lower dimension. Therefore if our original dataset contains 72 columns ( i.e features) and we manage to reduce these 72 columns down to 9 columns image the gains in time and processing speeds! However the question is how do we get the new data out of the PCA-reduced 9 columns? Via a clustering method!! In this case, I will use KMeans - more to come below. This notebook is organised as follows : \n\n 1. Filtering the Dataset to remove Null values and get only numerical columns. Standardising the features \n 2. Using the measure of **Explained Variance** to motivate and inform our search on getting the right number of PCA projections. Refer to Sebastian Raschka's awesome piece on Explained variance ( and PCA in general) here : http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_pca_in_3_steps.html. My notebook heavily borrows from his article so I need to give it a shout-out.\n 3. Implementing Principal Component Analysis \n 4. Using KMeans clustering to investigate relationships in the PCA projections (if there are any at all) and creating visualisations using the said clusters.\n 5. Pseudo means of extracting KMeans clusters and use those as new features (meta features) in your predictions - STILL UNDER PROGRESS"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cd3102d3-e469-d89e-9242-91dc661c6da1"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA # Principal Component Analysis module\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans # KMeans clustering \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Python defacto plotting library\nimport seaborn as sns # More snazzy plotting library\n%matplotlib inline "},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"078167f9-c9e1-5342-41cb-1c48ea0c6683"},"source":"Let's import the movie dataset with imagination.
