This is a controversial topic because, best/worst player is mainly about opinion and preference, and stats cannot simply justified the best/worst argument as basketball and sports in overall cannot be judged only by stats and number. \n\nLet's get started into it. For you who don't know what a draft is, it is a method for NBA teams to \"recruit\" new players from colleges or overseas. The recruitment process happened sequentially, so the team that get the first pick can recruit player first, and so on. With such method, it is expected that the first player drafted is the best player from the recruitment class. But sometimes, we got a highly picked player that doesn't meet the expectation or a lowly drafted player that overcome the expectation. Using this dataset, I will try to analyze which player that actually over/underacieved their draft position.

For example, the max net rating recorded in the dataset is 300 while the lowest is -200. This is happens because in one of those single game appearence, that player maybe only played in garbage time thus the net rating deflated. \n\nTo deal with this, we can use three approaches: drop the record of player who only played few number of games for every season, drop the record of player who only averaged few number of games overall, or simply removed this features from consideration. All of this approaches have their own pros and cons. In the first approach, we can drop some record of a player who actually has a decent career, but has one or two seasons with only one appearances due to injury/rough start.

If we not consider him, Nikola Jokic has the highest 'score', thus the most overachieve player since 1995. \n- The 59th pick does not give any sleeper players so far. The best of 59th pick is DJ Strawberry with a score of 7.6.\n- In the case of 8th pick, the best player is Andre Miller.
