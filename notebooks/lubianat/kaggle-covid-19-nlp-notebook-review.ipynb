I'm not a virology expert, neither a NLP ninja. So I was wondering: how can I actually make a contribution to this effort?\n\n\nI gave it some thought and landed on the following conclusions:\n\n### People are amazing!\nThe work done by other kagglers in this effort is just is just beautiful. So, the first step of my contribution will be to *review as many COVID NLP notebooks in Kaggle as I possibly can*. Even if it is a quick review. \n\n### Everyone knows something that can help; so everyone  can contribute!\nTasks are so diverse and require so many complementary skills that anyone can help. I could try and squeeze a life of dealing with NLP in a couple months of pandemic, but that is likely neither effective or very useful. \nThere is one thing, though, that I am very familizarized with, and that is the open knowledge graph at [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page Wikidata]. What I can do is to get statements from all these amazing analysis effort and convert them  into standardized, machine-readable, referenced public domain statements. tl;dr *add a Wikidata layer to Kaggle efforts*.\n\nFor those of you that know Wikidata, join us at our (COVID-19 WikiProject)[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_COVID-19! Every person counts] ! \nFor those of you that do not know Wikidata yet, join us anyway!\n\n\nThis notebook correspond to part 1: Review of current notebooks on Kaggle. \n\nA second notebook will be linked shortly, point towards the Wikidata-related work. \n\n### First part: Review of current notebooks on Kaggle. \n For every work, I will write a small  summary, trying to summarize explaining in a couple words what was done. \n It is a personal view of what the authors aimed at doing, the core tools that were used and what can be directly useful for the wikidata integration. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 1 - Review of Notebooks\n\n### Notebook #1 [Browsing research papers with a BM25 search engine](https://www.kaggle.com/dgunning/browsing-research-papers-with-a-bm25-search-engine)(v67)\n\nDwightGunning built a search engine to rank papers based on keywords related to the tasks.\nIt is available in GitHub as a Python  package, cord.\n\nThe user can choose subsets of papers based on dates. \n\nOutput is in the format of a ranked list of papers related to the words. \nHe also implements rendering of individual papers for exploration.\n\nQuery mechanism based on matching tokens to the document (Abstract).\n\nOlder versions of the notebook show how the search engine was built.\n\nCore tools used: Python: nltk for text processing; rank_bm25 for the searching algorithm.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Notebook #2 [CORD-19 Analysis with Sentence Embeddings](https://www.kaggle.com/davidmezzetti/cord-19-analysis-with-sentence-embeddings) (v21)\n\nDavid Mezzetti built a search engine to rank papers based on sentence embeddings matching a query.

FastTest vectors trained on CORD dataset for embedding. BM25 index used to weight  word embeddings for reaching a sentence embedding. Python package faiss for similarity searching.  TextRank algorithm to highlight best sentences.\n\n*Note:* David's highlights are a super good resource for adding information to Wikidata.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### Notebook #3 [NLP Text Mining - Disease behavior](https://www.kaggle.com/cstefanache/nlp-text-mining-disease-behavior) (v16)\n\nStefanache Cornel built a notebook on the virus behaviour, such as symptoms, incubation periods, transmission methods and so on. Built a simulator for virus propagation. \n\nHe assembled terms related to COVID19 (\"incubation\", possible symtpoms, virus references, organs and connecting words as \"lower\" or \"higher\").

Uses two algorithms,  Anserini and Bert-SQuAD. Anserini ranks sentences of text in relation to a question. Bert-SQuAD selects the best sentence segment to answer the question. He adapted the ideas of this paper by [Yang et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01718) to the COVID-19 dataset (actually the  lucene searchable CORD-19 database).  Google's Universal Sentence Encoder to find semantic similarities between question and answer.\n\nDefined a set of subquestions for each task.\n\nNice visualization, highlighting the specific part of the excerpts that better answers the query.\n\n\nCore Tools used: Anserini (via Pyserini), Bert-SQuAD,  Google's Universal Sentence Encoder, BioPython/Entrez to also query PubMed\n\nIt is not available as a package.\n\n\n*Note:* Q&A could be further refined if a knowledge base (as Wikidata) was populated.
