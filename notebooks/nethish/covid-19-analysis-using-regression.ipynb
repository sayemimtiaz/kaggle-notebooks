What is Covid-19?\nCovid-19 or Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As of May 15 2020 more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 300K deaths over 188 countries. The person infected with this virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. There are many ongoing trials and researches evaluating potential treatment.\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.
