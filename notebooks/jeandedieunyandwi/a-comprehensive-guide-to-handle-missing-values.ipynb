Often, missing values are one of the most problem that Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers are likely to deal with day to day, and it is not straight to know the right strategy. We often just drops. \n\nThere are many ways to deal with missing values, but there is no one fit all strategy. The right strategy depend on the dataset, its size or number of examples you have, the size of missing values in concerned features, what can be tolerated and so on. Choosing the best strategy will help us to provide accurate insights, and avoid us from communicating wrong information. It can also saves us time that we would spend tuning the model, from the fact that good model comes from good data. \n\nI this tutorial, I will walk through the common ways to handle missing values.
