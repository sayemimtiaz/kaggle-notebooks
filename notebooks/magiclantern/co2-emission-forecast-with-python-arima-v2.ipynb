It is a dynamic or time dependent problem with or without increasing or decreasing trend, seasonality. Time series modeling is a powerful method to describe and extract information from time-based data and help to make informed decisions about future outcomes.\n\nThis notebook explores how to retrieve csv times series dataset, visualizing time series dataset, how to transform dataset into times series, testing if the time series is stationary or not using graphical and Dickey-Fuller test statistic methods, how to transform time series to stationary, how to find optimal parameters to build seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model using grid search method, diagnosing time series prediction, validating the predictive power, forecasting 10 year future CO2 emission from power generation using natural gas.,  \n    \nTo complete this time series analysis, I use the following articles that cover the fundamental concepts about time series modeling:\n\n [Time series forecasting with codes in Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/time-series-forecasting-codes-python/).\n\n[Statistical forecasting: notes on regression and time series analysis](http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411home.htm).\n  \n  [Time Series Forecasting: Creating a seasonal ARIMA model with Python ](http://www.seanabu.com/2016/03/22/time-series-seasonal-ARIMA-model-in-python/).\n  \n [Forecast a time series with ARIMA in Python](https://datascience.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/815137c868b916821dec777bdc23013c).\n \n [A Guide to Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA in Python 3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-guide-to-time-series-forecasting-with-arima-in-python-3)\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c9ca404b-20e2-46c0-80ab-5e755aa1beef","_uuid":"639c042d5265c9306ce435fcf7c4d4ff8315948d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2) Time series dataset"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"55412ca8-9db7-4323-aace-d32b488eb9f5","_uuid":"6606723cc67c2637d1217fa1faf9aa4ed46facdf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I use a public dataset of monthly carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation available at the Energy Information Administration and Jason McNeill.

After trend and seasonality are assessed if they are present in the dataset, they will be removed from the series to transform the nonstationary dataset into stationary and the residuals are further analyzed.\n   \nA short summary about stationarity from Wikipedia: A stationary process is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance, if they are present, also do not change over time. \n\nStationarity is an assumption underlying many statistical procedures used in time series analysis, non-stationary data is often transformed to become stationary. The most common cause of violation of stationarity is a trend in the mean, which can be due to either the presence of a unit root or of a deterministic trend. If the nonstationarity is caused by the presence of unit root, stochastic shocks have permanent effects and the process is not mean-reverting. However, if it is caused by a deterministic trend, the process is called a trend stationary process, and stochastic shocks have only transitory effects after which the variable tends toward a deterministically evolving mean.\n    \n A trend stationary process is not strictly stationary, but can easily be transformed into a stationary process by removing the underlying trend, which is solely a function of time. Similarly, processes with one or more unit roots can be made stationary through differencing. An important type of non-stationary process that does not include a trend-like behavior is a cyclostationary process, which is a stochastic process that varies cyclically with time.\n\nNote: Given two jointly distributed random variables X and Y, the conditional probability distribution of Y given X is the probability distribution of Y when X is known to be a particular value.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1d072346-2b3d-4019-89f5-e376776c1f3f","_uuid":"7a4238a5e94b5d74ad66e5aa04a398086f801722","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import statsmodels\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import coint, adfuller","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"66de9529-0ef5-4cb8-b769-ce02015b0cca","_uuid":"b3dd689034da2f7f0e2517660e6143b113ae5647"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5.1.1 Graphically test stationary"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f56c6a01-e525-432a-bf5c-8de9337c699d","_uuid":"92384eaa93073f50bc0d5355fddd6677a532053f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.plot(mte)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bebfbfc6-b64c-4627-a052-642c33b3da3c","_uuid":"7045eb64d2e01f1c79de6b814f4078944ee5527d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the figures, it is evident that there is a trend in the CO2 emission dataset with seasonal variation.

This approach will be handled by the TestStationaryPlot() method. The second way to test stationarity is to use the statistical test (the Dickey-Fuller Test). The null hypothesis for the test is that the time series is non-stationary. The test results compare a Test Statistic and Critical Values (cutoff value) at different confidence levels. If the ‘Test Statistic’ is less than the ‘Critical Value’, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the series is stationary.

Before moving directly how to find the optimal values of the parameters let us see the two situations in stationarities: A strictly stationary series with no dependence among the values. This is the easy case wherein we can model the residuals as **white noise.** The second case being a series with significant dependence among values and needs statistical models like ARIMA to forecast future outcomes.\n\n**Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**: The ARIMA forecasting for a stationary time series is a linear function similar to linear regression. The predictors mainly depend on the parameters (p,d,q) of the ARIMA model:\n\n* Number of **Auto-Regressive (AR) terms (p)**: AR terms are just lags of dependent variable. For instance if p is 4, the predictors for x(t) will depend on x(t-1)….x(t-4).  This term allows us to incorporate the effect of past values into our model. This would be similar to stating that the weather is likely to be warm tomorrow if it has been warm the past 4 days.\n* Number of **Moving Average(MA) terms (q)**: MA terms are lagged forecast errors in prediction function. This term allows us to set the error of our model as a linear combination of the error values observed at previous time points in the past. For instance if q is 4, the predictors for x(t) will be e(t-1)….e(t-4) where e(i) is the difference between the moving average at ith instant and actual value.\n* Number of** Differences (d)**: These are the number of nonseasonal differences, i.e.,  if we took the first order difference. So either we can pass the first order difference variable and put d=0 or pass the original observed variable and put d=1. Both will generate same results. This term explains the number of past time points to subtract from the current value. This would be similar to stating that it is likely to be same temperature tomorrow if the difference in temperature in the last three days has been very small."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"eed808d7-4b70-4134-afa3-b975cfb43b4b","_uuid":"46a70ea87b5a47f920422e3f8fde23abf052fb0e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 6.1 Plot the ACF and PACF charts and find the optimal parameters"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ec498328-cb27-4a06-b500-f0d8f0a6bf04","_uuid":"2d37e814a93af5286a44fc6511aefac32f2a6301"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)**: It is a measure of the correlation between the time series (ts) with a lagged version of itself.

E.g. at lag 4, it will check the correlation but remove the effects already explained by lags 1 to  3.\n\nTherefore, the next step will be determining the tuning parameters (p and q) of the model by looking at the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation graphs.
