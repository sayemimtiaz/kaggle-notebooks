I predicted whether or not someone had heart disease using a descision tree by splitting and standardising the data. The quality of my predictions with the descision tree were reasonable. The descision tree was the best model and it usually made reliable and accurate predictions and showed that it didn't overfit or underfit to the data. I achieved my goal of not wanting to overfit my data and creating semi-accurate predictions,however i hypothesised that a random forest model would be the best model to use to make accurate predictions which was wrong as it had a higher MAE the the descision tree regressor. I believed that my strongest feature that would affect predictions would be the age of a person which proved to be true with the highest corration to the results in the output. My hyperparameter tuning had very little effect on my data and changing the output it gave so it was uneffective. Other models could have been used to a better effect if this dataset was bigger as this dataset has only 300 results to train your model and then also predict with your model which isn't enough to create a reliable large scale model.","metadata":{}}]}
