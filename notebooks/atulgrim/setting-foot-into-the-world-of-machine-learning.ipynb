Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables. A correlation matrix is used to summarize data, as an input into a more advanced analysis, and as a diagnostic for advanced analyses.\n\n### An example of a correlation matrix\nMostly, a correlation matrix is “square”, with the same variables shown in the rows and columns. The below visualization shows the correlations matrix. \n\n- It is used to state the importance of various things to people. \n- The line of 1.00s going from the top left to the bottom right is the main diagonal, which shows that each variable always perfectly correlates with itself. \n- This matrix is symmetrical. The correlation of elements above the diagonal are mirror image of the ones which are below.\n\n### Applications of a correlation matrix\n\nThere are three broad reasons for using a correlation matrix:\n\n- While summarizing a large amount of data where our goal is to see patterns in the data. \n- From our example above, now we can easily tell which of the variables highly correlate with each other and which don't.\n- To input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for:\n\n    - Exploratory factor analysis \n    - Confirmatory factor analysis\n    - Structural equation models \n    \n    \n- Used with linear regression, for example: A high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression estimates will be unreliable.
