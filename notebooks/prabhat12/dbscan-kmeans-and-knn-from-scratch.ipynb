It is based on the assumption that `clusters are dense regions seperated by regions of lower density`. \n\nIt is useful in finding `arbitary shaped clusters` and `sepearates outliers` too.\n\nParameters:\n\n1. **ε** (Epsilon) - radius of neighbourhood regions\n2. **minPts** - minimum number of points required to form that dense region\n\nEach point is either a core point,a border point or an outlier.\n\n1. **Core point** : If you draw a circle of radius ε, from a point, and the circle contains minPts number of points inside then the point is a core point.\n\n2. **Border point** : If you draw a circle of radius ε, the circle contains less number of points then minPts but is reachable from core point.\n\n3. **Outlier** : If you draw a circle of radius ε, and the circle and it does not contains minPts number of points, and is not within the reach of any core point, then it is an outlier. \n\nThe representation is shown in the following figure. `All the core points and border points will be merged to form a cluster.` \n\n*For more information, check this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jl9KkmgDIw)* "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I am taking the algorithm mentioned in [Wikipedia DBScan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN)\n\n`\nDBSCAN(DB, distFunc, eps, minPts) {\n    C := 0                                                  /* Cluster counter */\n    for each point P in database DB {\n        if label(P) ≠ undefined then continue               /* Previously processed in inner loop */\n        Neighbors N := RangeQuery(DB, distFunc, P, eps)     /* Find neighbors */\n        if |N| < minPts then {                              /* Density check */\n            label(P) := Noise                               /* Label as Noise */\n            continue\n        }\n        C := C + 1                                          /* next cluster label */\n        label(P) := C                                       /* Label initial point */\n        SeedSet S := N \\ {P}                                /* Neighbors to expand */\n        for each point Q in S {                             /* Process every seed point Q */\n            if label(Q) = Noise then label(Q) := C          /* Change Noise to border point */\n            if label(Q) ≠ undefined then continue           /* Previously processed (e.g., border point) */\n            label(Q) := C                                   /* Label neighbor */\n            Neighbors N := RangeQuery(DB, distFunc, Q, eps) /* Find neighbors */\n            if |N| ≥ minPts then {                          /* Density check (if Q is a core point) */\n                S := S ∪ N                                  /* Add new neighbors to seed set */\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`\nRangeQuery(DB, distFunc, Q, eps) {\n    Neighbors N := empty list\n    for each point P in database DB {                      /* Scan all points in the database */\n        if distFunc(Q, P) ≤ eps then {                     /* Compute distance and check epsilon */\n            N := N ∪ {P}                                   /* Add to result */\n        }\n    }\n    return N\n}\n`"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The algorithm is very simple and the general idea is:\n\n\n    For each point in training set (X_train):\n        1.
