Before anything it might be important to ask yourself **what is \"happiness\"**.For me can be from eating ice cream to watching a movie with my family. Maybe for you is buying a new car, traveling to an exotic country or playing with your dog. Think how many different choices someone has to respond this question. Just to get an idea there are more than **7 billion** people to ask. So this question is way harder than it looks.  \n\nThe available information is always a headache. Getting good data just for this question seems imposible. Yet amazing organisations manage to collect and get the best information from all around the world and give it for **free** (How cool is that?).\n\nIn this case here we are with \"**The World Happiness Report**\" made by the **United Nations**. (For the curious ones: they made reports like this one since 2012, if you want to look around).  \n\nIn this report, the **quality of peoples lives** (by country) is the best approach for this emotion. In this report they present the links between **goverment and happiness**, and **generosity** and the **pro-social** behaviour. The data that we have is a ranking, being 1 the best among all the sample. \n\nLets review for this year which are the happiest and unhappiest countries on earth. And not just that. Lets see **why** are those countries like that.  \n\n**Lets get to work!**\n\nHere below we start with the usual imports (i selected them from other Kernels, the most used ones, to compare and get something myself).

If you think about it, this variables really define some of the answers you might give to the main question. Generally speaking, people focuses on money and health on this matter. So this is a good approach, an a comparable too.\n\nFor the ranking it is important to notice that **the measure of happiness** in each country is based on \"**individuals own assessments of their lives**\" = Cantril ladder. Basicaly it asks for you to think of a ladder. With the best possible life for you, you will give a '10' and for the worst possible life a '0'. Now you are asked to *rate your own current life* based on that 0 to 10 scale. Then for a country, its rating is the average ladder score. \nQuite easy!\n\nThe rankings are from nationally representative samples, for **2016-2018**. But what about the variables then, if they are not in the rate-process. Good question!, the six variables: \n\n* GDP per capita \n* Social support \n* healthy life expectancy\n* freedom \n* generosity \n* absence of corruption\n\nAre used to **explain the variation across countries**. \n\nBelow we can view the **top ten** ranking countries and the **bottom ten** ranking countries of the sample (156 countries). Another important thing to notice, is that every variable has **ranking** and NOT AN ACTUAL VALUE. This means that 1 is the best and so on.."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"HAPPIEST"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"..and the UNHAPPIEST"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.tail(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Finland** according to the ranking is the best place to live!, with the best position in the ladder (1). **South Sudan** on the other hand...well lets say it is not.

Europe in general is quite happy too. \n\nIn my case, i am from **Colombia** so im quite curious for the ranking in latin america. For Colombia, it has the **43th position**, behind countries like Uruguay, Brazil, Panama and Chile. It has a better position than Argentina, Ecuador, Honduras and Bolivia though. Well were not exactly the happiest country in the world, but we are getting there!\n\nMy neighbour **Venezuela** on the other hand has the **108th position**, which is very far from the latin america average.
