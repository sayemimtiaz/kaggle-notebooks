Despite all of these, our function performed quite well I would say, (LOL) it's not that far out from the accuracy of sklearn, however there are other metrics to consider in comparing these models, that's also yours to find out. <br>\nTo wrap things up let us review our objectives and wether we've accomplished them. The first objective was to understand the theory behind Logistic Regression. We've discussed that in the section **Logistic Regression behind the mask**, and I do hope that we all understood the things I stated there. The second objective was to implement the Logistic Regression without using built-in Logistic Regression libraries, yes we've done that in the section **Logistic Regression in action**, it was trained, and evaluated. In the same section, we have also predicted the churn of the customers in the Telco Customer Churn dataset. <br><br>\nThis logistic regression implementation would probably be never used in production and it is unlikely that it will defeat sklearn's own LogisticRegression module, however the goal of this kernel was to understand intrecately the structure of different algorithms, in this case, Logistic Regression. Stay tuned, for more of this kind of kernels. If you liked this kernel please leave an upvote, thank you."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5d66f79bc5bcce02909b48b56bdf4cc3c16fc76c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>References:</h2><br>\nThis kernel was heavily influenced by the following:\n* https://medium.com/@martinpella/logistic-regression-from-scratch-in-python-124c5636b8ac\n* https://beckernick.github.io/logistic-regression-from-scratch/"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
