It's not a differentiable function. `torch.max` and `==` are both non-continuous and non-differentiable operations, so we can't use the accuracy for computing gradients w.r.t the weights and biases.\n\n2. It doesn't take into account the actual probabilities predicted by the model, so it can't provide sufficient feedback for incremental improvements. \n\nDue to these reasons, accuracy is a great **evaluation metric** for classification, but not a good loss function. A commonly used loss function for classification problems is the **cross entropy**, which has the following formula:\n\n![cross-entropy](https://i.imgur.com/VDRDl1D.png)\n\nWhile it looks complicated, it's actually quite simple:\n\n* For each output row, pick the predicted probability for the correct label. E.g. if the predicted probabilities for an image are `[0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...]` and the correct label is `1`, we pick the corresponding element `0.3` and ignore the rest.\n\n* Then, take the [logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) of the picked probability. If the probability is high i.e. close to 1, then its logarithm is a very small negative value, close to 0. And if the probability is low (close to 0), then the logarithm is a very large negative value. We also multiply the result by -1, which results is a large postive value of the loss for poor predictions.\n\n* Finally, take the average of the cross entropy across all the output rows to get the overall loss for a batch of data.\n\nUnlike accuracy, cross-entropy is a continuous and differentiable function that also provides good feedback for incremental improvements in the model (a slightly higher probability for the correct label leads to a lower loss). This makes it a good choice for the loss function. \n\nAs you might expect, PyTorch provides an efficient and tensor-friendly implementation of cross entropy as part of the `torch.nn.functional` package. Moreover, it also performs softmax internally, so we can directly pass in the outputs of the model without converting them into probabilities.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"loss_fn = F.cross_entropy","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loss of current batch of data\n\nloss = loss_fn(outputs, labels) # pass outputs instead of preds as cross_entropy will apply softmax, labels will be converted to one-hot encoded vectors\nprint(loss)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='ModelClass'></a>\n## **5.

This is a fairly weak assumption, as there may not actually exist a linear relationship between the pixel intensities in an image and the digit it represents. While it works reasonably well for a simple dataset like MNIST (getting us to >80% accuracy), we need more sophisticated models (e.g., **Neural Networks**) that can capture non-linear relationships between image pixels and labels for complex tasks like recognizing everyday objects, animals etc. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='Predict_test'></a>\n## **8.

Creating Model Class** ##\n\nTo improve upon [logistic regression](https://jvn.io/aakashns/a1b40b04f5174a18bd05b17e3dffb0f0), we'll create a **neural network** with one **hidden layer**. Here's what this means:\n\n* Instead of using a single `nn.Linear` object to transform a batch of inputs (pixel intensities) into a batch of outputs (class probabilities), we'll use two `nn.Linear` objects. Each of these is called a layer in the network. \n\n* The first layer (also known as the hidden layer) will transform the input matrix of shape `batch_size x 784` into an intermediate output matrix of shape `batch_size x hidden_size`, where `hidden_size` is a preconfigured parameter (e.g. 32 or 64).\n\n* The intermediate outputs are then passed into a non-linear *activation function*, which operates on individual elements of the output matrix.\n\n* The result of the activation function, which is also of size `batch_size x hidden_size`, is passed into the second layer (also knowns as the output layer), which transforms it into a matrix of size `batch_size x 10`, identical to the output of the logistic regression model.\n\nIntroducing a hidden layer and an activation function allows the model to learn more complex, multi-layered and non-linear relationships between the inputs and the targets. Here's what it looks like visually:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vDOGEkG.png)\n\nThe activation function we'll use here is called a **Rectified Linear Unit** or **ReLU**, and it has a really simple formula: `relu(x) = max(0,x)` i.e. if an element is negative, we replace it by 0, otherwise we leave it unchanged.\n\n<img src = 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DDBk3ZFNtJc/maxresdefault.jpg' width=\"600\">\n\n<br><br>\nTo define the model, we extend the `nn.Module` class, just as we did with logistic regression.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class MnistModel_NN(nn.Module):\n    # this is the constructor, which creates an object of class MnistModel_NN when called\n    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):\n        super().__init__()\n        # hidden layer\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n        # output layer\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)\n    \n    # reshape/flatten input tensor when it is passed to model\n    def forward(self, xb):\n        xb = xb.reshape(-1, 784) # -1 so that it will work for different batch sizes\n        # Get intermediate outputs using hidden layer\n        out = self.linear1(xb)\n        # Apply activation function\n        out = F.relu(out)\n        # Get predictions using output layer\n        out = self.linear2(out)\n        return out\n    \n    # this is for loading the batch of train image and outputting its loss, accuracy & predictions\n    def training_step(self, batch):\n        images,labels = batch\n        out = self(images)                            # generate predictions\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(out, labels)           # compute loss\n        acc,preds = accuracy(out, labels)             # calculate accuracy\n        return {'train_loss': loss, 'train_acc':acc}\n       \n    # this is for computing the train average loss and acc for each epoch\n    def train_epoch_end(self, outputs):\n        batch_losses = [x['train_loss'] for x in outputs]   # get all the batches loss\n        epoch_loss = torch.stack(batch_losses).mean()       # combine losses\n        batch_accs = [x['train_acc'] for x in outputs]      # get all the batches acc\n        epoch_acc = torch.stack(batch_accs).mean()          # combine accuracies\n        return {'train_loss': epoch_loss.item(), 'train_acc': epoch_acc.item()}\n    \n    # this is for loading the batch of val/test image and outputting its loss, accuracy, predictions & labels\n    def validation_step(self, batch):\n        images,labels = batch\n        out = self(images)                       # generate predictions\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(out, labels)      # compute loss\n        acc,preds = accuracy(out, labels)        # calculate accuracy and get predictions\n        return {'val_loss': loss.detach(), 'val_acc':acc, 'preds':preds, 'labels':labels} # detach extracts only the needed number, or other numbers will crowd memory\n    \n    # this is for computing the validation average loss and acc for each epoch\n    def validation_epoch_end(self, outputs):\n        batch_losses = [x['val_loss'] for x in outputs]     # get all the batches loss\n        epoch_loss = torch.stack(batch_losses).mean()       # combine losses\n        batch_accs = [x['val_acc'] for x in outputs]        # get all the batches acc\n        epoch_acc = torch.stack(batch_accs).mean()          # combine accuracies\n        return {'val_loss': epoch_loss.item(), 'val_acc': epoch_acc.item()}\n\n    # this is for printing out the results after each epoch\n    def epoch_end(self, epoch, train_result, val_result):\n        print('Epoch [{}], train_loss: {:.4f}, train_acc: {:.4f}, val_loss: {:.4f}, val_acc: {:.4f}'.format(epoch+1, train_result['train_loss'], train_result['train_acc'], val_result['val_loss'], val_result['val_acc']))\n    \n    # this is for using on the test set, it outputs the average loss and acc, and outputs the predictions\n    def test_prediction(self, outputs):\n        batch_losses = [x['val_loss'] for x in outputs]\n        epoch_loss = torch.stack(batch_losses).mean()                           # combine losses\n        batch_accs = [x['val_acc'] for x in outputs]\n        epoch_acc = torch.stack(batch_accs).mean()                              # combine accuracies\n        batch_preds = [pred for x in outputs for pred in x['preds'].tolist()]   # combine predictions\n        batch_labels = [lab for x in outputs for lab in x['labels'].tolist()]   # combine labels\n        return {'test_loss': epoch_loss.item(), 'test_acc': epoch_acc.item(), 'test_preds': batch_preds, 'test_labels': batch_labels}       \n        ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='GPU'></a>\n## **12.
