The tokenizer takes care of that for us.\n\nBERT and RoBERTa may have the same architecture, but they differ in tokenization.

If the substrings are in its vocabulary, they will stay as is: this is the case for `Cities`, `Taking` and `List`. However, if a resulting string is not in its vocabulary, it will be split again until every string is represented by its vocabulary. For example, `Transplanted` is split multiple times until every token is represented in the BERT vocabulary: it is split into three tokens.\nThe BERT tokenizer is lacking when it comes to complex characters spread over multiple bytes, as can be seen with emojis. In the sequence used, an emoji of a Cityscape was added. As the BERT tokenizer cannot interpret this emoji on a byte-level, it replaces it by the unknown token [UNK].\n\n**RoBERTa Tokenizer**\n\nOn the other hand, the RoBERTa tokenizer has a slightly different approach. Here too, the string is split into multiple substrings, which are themselves split into multiple substrings until every substring can be represented by the vocabulary. However, the RoBERTa tokenizer has a **byte-level approach**. This tokenizer can represent every sequence as a combination of bytes, which makes it shine in the case of complex characters spread over multiple bytes, as with the Cityscape emoji. Instead of using the unknown token, this tokenizer can correctly encode the Cityscape emoji as the combination of multiple bytes. This tokenizer therefore does not require an unknown token, as it can handle every byte separately.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The transformers library provides a helpful encode function which will handle most of the parsing and data prep steps for us.\n\nBefore we are ready to encode our text, though, we need to decide on a maximum sentence length for padding / truncating to.\n\nThe below cell will perform one tokenization pass of the dataset in order to measure the maximum sentence length.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"max_len_bert = 0\nmax_len_roberta = 0\n\n# For every sentence...\nfor sent in sentences:\n\n    # Tokenize the text and add `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens.\n    input_ids_bert = bert_tokenizer.encode(sent, add_special_tokens=True)\n    input_ids_roberta = roberta_tokenizer.encode(sent, add_special_tokens=True)\n\n    # Update the maximum sentence length.\n    max_len_bert = max(max_len_bert, len(input_ids_bert))\n    max_len_roberta = max(max_len_roberta, len(input_ids_roberta))\n\n    \nprint('Max sentence length BERT: ', max_len_bert)\nprint('Max sentence length RoBERTa: ', max_len_roberta)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Just in case there are some longer test sentences, I'll set the maximum length to 120.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we're ready to perform the real tokenization.\n\nThe tokenizer.encode_plus function combines multiple steps for us:\n\n1.
