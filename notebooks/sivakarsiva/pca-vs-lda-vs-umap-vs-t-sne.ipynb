Having to drop the dimensionality down to two or three, make it possible to visualize the data on a 2d or 3d plot, meaning important insights can be gained by analysing these patterns in terms of clusters and much more."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n# Main Approaches for Dimensionality Reduction\nThe two main approaches to reducing dimensionality: Projection and Manifold Learning.\n* Projection: This technique deals with projecting every data point which is in high dimension, onto a subspace suitable lower-dimensional space in a way which approximately preserves the distances between the points.\n* Manifold Learning: Many dimensionality reductions algorithm work by modelling the manifold on which the training instance lie; this is called Manifold learning. It relies on the manifold hypothesis or assumption, which holds that most real-world high-dimensional datasets lie close to a much lower-dimensional manifold, this assumption in most of the cases is based on observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic.[4]\nNow let's briefly explain the three techniques before jumping into solving the use case."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport time\n\n# For plotting\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#PCA\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n#TSNE\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\n#UMAP\nimport umap\n\nimport plotly.io as plt_io\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/sign-language-mnist/sign_mnist_train/sign_mnist_train.csv')\ntrain.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.shape\n# Get indexes where name column doesn't have value john","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = train[train['label'] < 10]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Setting the label and the feature columns\ny = train.loc[:,'label'].values\nx = train.loc[:,'pixel1':].values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"np.unique(y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n## Standardizing the data\nstandardized_data = StandardScaler().fit_transform(x)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\nOne of the most known dimensionality reduction “unsupervised” algorithm is PCA(Principal Component Analysis).\nThis works by identifying the hyperplane which lies closest to the data and then projects the data on that hyperplane while retaining most of the variation in the data set.\nPrincipal Components.\n\nThe axis that explains the maximum amount of variance in the training set is called the Principal Components.\nThe axis orthogonal to this axis is called the second principal component.
