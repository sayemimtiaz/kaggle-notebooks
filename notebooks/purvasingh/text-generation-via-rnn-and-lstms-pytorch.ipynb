These word embeddings are then fed to the next layer of LSTM cells. <br>\n\nThe main purpose of using embedding layer is dimensionality reduction.\n\n### Contiguous LSTM Layer\n\nOur LSTM layer is defined by *hidden state size and number of layers*. At each step, an LSTM cell will produce an output and a new hidden state. The hidden state will be passed to next cell as input (memory representation.)\n\n### Final Fully Connected Linear Layer\n\nThe output generated by LSTM cell will be then fed into a *Sigmoid activated fully-connected linear layer.* This layer is responsible for mapping LSTM output to desired output size.\n\nThe output of the sigmoid function will be the probability distribution of most likely next word.<br><br>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/purvasingh96/Talking-points-global-hackathon/blob/master/assets/lstm_rnn_2.png?raw=1\" height=\"500\"></img>\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch.nn as nn\n\nclass RNN(nn.Module):\n    \n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, output_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout=0.5):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the PyTorch RNN Module\n        :param vocab_size: The number of input dimensions of the neural network (the size of the vocabulary)\n        :param output_size: The number of output dimensions of the neural network\n        :param embedding_dim: The size of embeddings, should you choose to use them        \n        :param hidden_dim: The size of the hidden layer outputs\n        :param dropout: dropout to add in between LSTM/GRU layers\n        \"\"\"\n        super(RNN, self).__init__()\n        #
