They represent key research questions where insights developed by the Kaggle community can be most impactful in the areas of at-risk population evaluation and capacity management. - COVID19 Uncover Challenge\n\n<h3> Notebook Detail Study </h3>\n\nThis notebook tends to analyze the methods in which the healthcare infrastructure and resources might had an impact on COVID-19. For this notebook I'll drill down into the associations and correaltions of healthcare and COVID-19 spread. With detailed analysis of what kind of patients actually require HCP and Hospital care, we would look on how our existing infrastructure competes on this ground.\n\n<h3> Brief overview of Notebook as per Evaluation Criteria </h3>\n\nThe notebook takes use of the UNCOVER , Covidnet-hospitalization-rates dataset, COVCSD (COVID-19 Countries Statistical Dataset) and COVID-19 in USA dataset to answer the questions in this notebook. More data is collected open-sourced from Staista and John Hopkings Dataset on COVID-19. Using many statistical analyses methods (mentioned under individual URL's) it tends to understand the cause of COVID-19 Hospitalizations on Clinincal Terms and understand the requirement of health infrastrucutre on a better note.\n\nThis would certainly prove helpful for policy makers to understand what actually causes hospitalizations in COVID-19 to prepare the existing medical infrastructure to handle the pandemic proving useful with time.

As the number of cases rose, out of available data, about 10 per cent of the population required hospitalisation while  the reported details of confirmed cases are coming at a slower pace than the positive case counts.\n\nWhen addressing affected age groups, the old age group ( 75-84) was heavily affected. Howeve, the hospital admission rate decreased with the decrease in age in the hospital admission rate. Hypertension and Obesity came out on top as the prime medical conditions among hospitalised population. While metabolic and cardiovascular diseases were second most priortised ailments. The majority of deaths recorded had Circulatory System Diseases and metabolic diseases.\n\nAvailable data were then used to check if prediction of patients suffering from COVID - 19 would require ICU. The results also predicted that old age populations, primarily suffering from chronic illness were more prone to death by the Covid - 19.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<H2> The next big steps </H2>\n\nFor the next series of Analyses, We would look forward to undestand the medical parameters and hospitalization rate's relation.
