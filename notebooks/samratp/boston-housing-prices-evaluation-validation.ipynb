A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n\nThe dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n\nRun the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cfbe27c88e5cd562ac10686d7d9568551b0e0b95","_cell_guid":"786a480c-1a31-459f-81fd-a561b3e4f14e","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import libraries necessary for this project\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import scorer\nfrom sklearn.metrics import make_scorer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\n# Pretty display for notebooks\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Load the Boston housing dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/housing.csv')\nprices = data['MEDV']\nfeatures = data.drop('MEDV', axis = 1)\n    \n# Success\nprint(\"Boston housing dataset has {} data points with {} variables each.\".format(*data.shape))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ca2b7e8cc394aa47a15f08c317288e67d48fb1e6","_cell_guid":"f0b95a7b-5573-43d8-9851-c40581bd6265","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check for data types and Null values\ndata.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8d5e1d2b19da8a9c0e76ef53cc8114677d4f55bd","_cell_guid":"796d61c8-82fb-4d3b-ac61-46cac73dbc5c","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"46238b753aaf948b88871c3d1d774a2f0d840f07","_cell_guid":"fa4cb167-0b3c-400c-8b9e-21bd7dc54209"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Visualization Code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6f70d1a27e2b02305ea40df767050c8065c8be88","_cell_guid":"d5459cac-daeb-48d3-b811-7eaa27142451","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"###########################################\n# Suppress matplotlib user warnings\n# Necessary for newer version of matplotlib\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category = UserWarning, module = \"matplotlib\")\n#\n# Display inline matplotlib plots with IPython\nfrom IPython import get_ipython\nget_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')\n###########################################\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pl\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import validation_curve\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit, train_test_split\n\ndef ModelLearning(X, y):\n    \"\"\" Calculates the performance of several models with varying sizes of training data.\n        The learning and testing scores for each model are then plotted. \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create 10 cross-validation sets for training and testing\n    cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits = 10, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)\n    cv.get_n_splits(X)\n\n    # Generate the training set sizes increasing by 50\n    train_sizes = np.rint(np.linspace(1, X.shape[0]*0.8 -

So, a house that has an `'RM'` value(number of rooms) of 6 will have a lesser worth than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7.

So, as the percent of lower class workers decreases, the price of the house will increase. In this case, a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value(percent of lower class workers) of 15 have home prices worth more than a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value of 20.

For this project, you will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance.

In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins (ex. the degree of a polynomial in regression model). By contrast, the values of other parameters are derived via training (ex. the coefficients of the polynomial in regression model). \n\n2. _How it can be applied to optimize a learning algorithm?_ - Grid Search performs hyperparameter optimization by simply searching through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. A grid search algorithm must be guided by some performance metric, typically measured by cross-validation on the training set or evaluation on a held-out validation set. The performance metric will help us to choose the best hyperparameter values to build a better model.\n\nFor example, if we are using DecisionTreeRegressor() we can pass the below hyperparameters to the Grid Search to find out the best combination.\n\nparams = {'max_depth': [2,3,4], 'max_features':['auto', 'sqrt', 'log2']}\n\nGrid Search will try out all combinations of the above hyperparameters while building the models.

Out of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining (k−1) subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is repeated k times for each of the folds with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The 'k' scores from the folds can then be averaged to produce a single estimation.\n\n2. _What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?_ - With Grid Search we are trying to find the optimal hyperparameters for our model. For Grid Search to identify the best params we should use a score function and test the model on the validation set. If we choose a simple validation set by picking 30% of the data points, there is always a danger of not correctly choosing the best hyperparameters as there is a chance of overfitting/underfitting with specific train/test split and thus a wrong score. So, the ideal strategy is to choose a k-fold cross-validation technique wherein we could get an average score for each of the folds which would correctly get the optimal hyperparameters."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ac7ff0a70ea6daecdd54ac35f44b799998215f50","_cell_guid":"088f8277-f198-44bc-a7f8-da25162c0d3e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Implementation: Fitting a Model\nYour final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n\nIn addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable).

Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given.

Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?\n- Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?\n- Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?\n- Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"42d05a085e2d7ccde4983fa08c719193ca20cd20","_cell_guid":"19cdaa89-21b6-4317-8d57-f215137fb7aa"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Answer: **\n\nTo know if the constructed model can be used in a real-world applications depends on many factors.\n\n1. As the data is collected from 1978, the information may not portray the current trend in the locality even though inflation is taken in to account.\n2. Frankly speaking we cannot exactly predict the price of a house using just 3 independent variables. There are many more factors like the 'Building Type', 'Quality of Construction', 'Year Built', 'Bathrooms', 'Kitchen Quality', 'Garages', 'Pool', 'Fence' which will give us a better estimate of any house.\n3. As the model is built on a very less number of features and some data points it will not be very robust. So, when using the predictions from this model care should be taken to consider other external factors also. (Robustness of the model was evident from the above block of code.)\n4. This model is built from data collected in 'Boston' and so can be used to predict the prices of houses in 'Boston' only and the reason being different cities will have different price ranges of houses.\n5. It's not fair to judge the price of an individual house just based on the neighborhood. Many properties of the house play a vital role in predicted its price aprt from it's neighborhood."}],"metadata":{"anaconda-cloud":{},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
