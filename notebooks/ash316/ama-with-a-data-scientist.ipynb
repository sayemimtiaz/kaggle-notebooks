Which all tools and techniques do they use in their day to day work, In which all domains does their expertise lay in? and many such questions. Many students and aspiring Data Scientists keep asking many Data Scientists about how to get started in DS/ML. I myself have personally asked many people about the same. This motivated me to create this notebook, where we will ask some basic questions every aspiring Data Scientist asks and let the data speak and give the optimal answers. As the questions are intended for Data Scientists,we will only check the survey responses by the Data Scientists in this notebook.\n\nI hope this notebook becomes a good headstart for the aspiring Data Scientists.

So can you please explain what exactly Data Science is in simpler terms??\n\n### Answer: \n\nIn the simplest terms, Data Science is nothing but finding out meaningful insights and hidden patterns from a given trove of data. These insights and patterns prove to be very valuable for any business, as they can help in revenue generation, cost optimization and many other solutions. The diagram below will give you a better picture about the same.\n\n![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ffae37389413421f79ec6ec197323eb9)\n\nAnd as the amount and variety of data is increasing, the responsibilities have increased and people are looking for experts and thus the demand for Data Scientists is also increasing.

Getting the data can be painstaking and it really depends from where do we fetch our data. If it comes from a publicly hosted site like Kaggle, it is very easy and no time is required. However its not the case in real world. In real world cases, we need to select the right data in the right format and build a secure way of transferring the data flow to our ML models or application.\n\n**Cleaning Data**: The most time consuming part, and I am sure no one will disagree on this!! Transforming the data into correct format for the application, detecting and correcting corrupt or inaccurate data, etc all come under data cleaning. The main challenge in this is correction of values to remove duplicates and invalid entries, as deletion of data can lead to information loss. Hence critical decisions and thinking is required, which makes it a time consuming process.\n\n**Visualizing Data**: It is probably the least time consuming process but a very important one, and it reduces even further if we use Enterprise Tools like Tableau,Qlik,Tibco,etc, which helps in building graphs and dashboards with simple drag and drop features.\n\n**Model Building**: It is where the data scientists build decide a suitable algorithm ,build predictive models, tune these models,etc. \n\n**Putting Model into Production**: Simply it means encapsulating the ML model into an application or hosting it somewhere so that others can use the model with their own data. Now a days it has become very easy to build API's that directly query the ML model and return results based on the user input data. The process has become easier due to the great integration of ML models and cloud deployment, which has infact reduced the time required for production deployment.\n\n**Finding Insights and Communicating with Stakeholders**: Finding insights is finding hidden patterns and facts in the trove in data and effectively communicating it to the clients with minimum cognitive load, such that it helps improving business decisions and has a positive impact on the business processes. Effective communication and simple but effective visualizations play a very important role in this phase."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c0287f5eaece646b5280271258f955150f68c085"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Q8.

Before diving into building models, every Data Scientist performs EDA(Exploratory Data Analytics),which is the practice of describing the data by means of statistical and visualization techniques to bring important aspects of that data into focus for further analysis. This involves looking at your data set from many angles, describing it, and summarizing it without making any assumptions about its contents.

Ain't they biased towards a particular group? So bias in ML models means that the model has been trained with data that is biased/influenced. Thus bias and fairness are two contradictory terms in Machine Learning. Bias can occur either due to data collection techniques, errors by data analysts, or the data itself maybe biased. ML models are trained on data collected by us, and thus it may contain inherent biases. Removing bias from data to make fair decisions is a key ML problem, and I strongly believe that others also agree to this point.

How do you explain the output of your model?\n\nDo you conclude that your model is effective solely by looking at its accuracy, or are there any other metrics you check for?\n\n### Answer:\n\nAlways remember -  **ACCURACY CAN BE MISLEADING!!** Evaluating and explaining your machine learning algorithm is an essential part of any project. Your model may give you a good accuracy while testing, but it may fail when you finally deploy it into your business processes. Most of the times we use accuracy to measure the performance of our model, however it is not enough to truly judge our model. For example, consider that there are 98% samples of class A and 2% samples of class B in our training set. Then our model can easily get 98% training accuracy by simply predicting every training sample belonging to class A.\n\nWhen the same model is tested on a test set with 60% samples of class A and 40% samples of class B, then the test accuracy would drop down to 60%. Accuracy is great, but gives us the false sense of achieving better model.So just reporting the accuracy to a non-technical person can prove to be a wrong perception for that person.
