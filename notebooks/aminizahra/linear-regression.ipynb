It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### **What is linear regression used for?**\n\nLinear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable.

Imagine we are predicting weight (y) from height (x). Our linear regression model representation for this problem would be:\n\n**y = B0 + B1 * x1**\n\nor\n\n**weight =B0 +B1 * height**\n\nWhere B0 is the bias coefficient and B1 is the coefficient for the height column. We use a learning technique to find a good set of coefficient values. Once found, we can plug in different height values to predict the weight.\n\nFor example, lets use B0 = 0.1 and B1 = 0.5. Let’s plug them in and calculate the weight (in kilograms) for a person with the height of 182 centimeters.\n\nweight = 0.1 + 0.5 * 182\n\nweight = 91.1\n\nYou can see that the above equation could be plotted as a line in two-dimensions. The B0 is our starting point regardless of what height we have. We can run through a bunch of heights from 100 to 250 centimeters and plug them to the equation and get weight values, creating our line.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a
