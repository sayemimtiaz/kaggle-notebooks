Then, should we include steps to balance our training dataset? If so, which methods should we use?** \n\n  - We will carry out the entire process first without and later with artificially balaced data. Then, we will compare the results.\n    \n**3- Our data is very high dimensional. Should we choose subsets of the available features?**\n\n  - We will use ANOVA F measure to assign scores to each feature and select k features with the highest scores. We will train our models with a range of different k values and keep the best performing feature set.\n  - We will also use PCA to extract features and repeat the process with k principle components, varying k.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Imports\nimport sys, warnings\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n\n\nfrom sklearn import decomposition, tree, preprocessing\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import scale, RobustScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, GridSearchCV,RandomizedSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report,accuracy_score,recall_score,precision_score,f1_score,confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Loading the data\ndf_unclean = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/company-bankruptcy-prediction/data.csv\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## General structure of the dataset\n\n### Displaying the first few rows","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_unclean.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Looking for missing values","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# get null values\nnull_values = df_unclean.isnull().sum().sum()\nprint('Null:', null_values)\n# get nan values\nnan_values = np.isnan(df_unclean.values).sum()\nprint('Nan:', nan_values)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"No missing values are present in the dataset.\n\n### Displaying the feature names and types","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_unclean.info()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see that all features other than  \"Net Income Flag\" and \"Liability-Assets Flag\" are numerical.
