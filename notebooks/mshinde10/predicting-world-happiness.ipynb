On this day, in 2017, the UN also release the World Happiness Report - a ranking of which countries in the world could be considered as \"happy\". This report contains 155 countries from each continent to construct an understanding of which countries may be the happiest. This ranking is revered across the globe, as it could be an indication of the country's policy-making decision skills. Experts around the world ( in economy, psychology, and foreign affairs) have noted that these scores may be a good indication of a country's progress - but of course, it is not the end all and be all of a country's progress. \n\nNow, you may be wondering, how exactly can happiness be determined? The UN looked at seven different variables and took a survey of the population in order to construct an overall \"happiness score\". This score was a measure of data taken by the Gallup World Poll. Questions were answered by asking individuals to rank each question about their life on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being living their best possible life, and 0 being living worse than the situation they are in at the moment of the survey. Also, they were asked to rate their current life on that survey as well. Each variable was then normalized and then compared against a Dystopia; a hypothetical country which would have the lowest score in all categories - and a lower score than the  lowest ranking country. While we cannot determine a conclusive impact of these variables on the Happiness Score, we can use them to get a better understanding of why some countries are ranked higher than other. \n\nUsing these seven variables, we can then attempt to construct a  linear regression model which may help us predict the happiness score in the 155 countries. We can then compare the predicted score to the actual score to observe how accurate how model is. Moving on, while are using these variables to just build an understanding of the ranking - we can still see which variable(s) are highly correlated with happiness score and if there are any differences in these variables between 2015 - 2017. Below are some questions that were asked and answered in this report, and an explanation of the variables used in the World Happiness Report.
