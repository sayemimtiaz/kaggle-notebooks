Some people think of it as an investment vehicle (similar to commodities in nature) while others think of it as a store of value (similar to gold). Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized global virtual currency with minimum friction in transactions and a high level of security due to the nature of its underlying blockchain network. Since its inception Bitcoin has been rapidly adopted by enthusiasts and investors worldwide. Now it is traded on multiple online exchanges on the internet by virtually everyone in the world. Consequently, the number of factors affecting the price movements of the Bitcoins is huge and the underlying mechanisms are complex. Every investor wishes to gain a competitive advantage in predicting the price movements of Bitcoins. In this notebook I try to analyze the relationships between historical Bitcoin price movements and other relevant indicators such as the level of Bitcoin adoption, the level of difficulty in Bitcoin mining, etc, with the objective to gain insights into how different factors would affect the prices of Bitcoins and how this knowledge would convert to a strategic advantage in everyday Bitcoin trading.
