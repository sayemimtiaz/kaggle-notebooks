There are many different perceptions of the H2O software, but the primary purpose of H2O is as a distributed (many machines), parallel (many CPUs), in memory (several hundred GBs Xmx) processing engine. \n\nWait, we as Data Scientists do not need to know Java for using H2O to build models. We can use our favorite language (Python or R) :) \n\n** H2O - Key Features:**\n\nSome of the key features \n1. Access from both R and Python\n2. Access from  web-based interface named Flow. By means of Flow, data scientists are able to import, explore, and modify datasets, play with models, verify models performances, and much more. (This is not accessible here in Kaggle Kernels)\n3. AutoML : automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit. \n4. Distributed, In-memory processing : In-memory processing with fast serialization between nodes and clusters to support massive datasets. \n5. Simple Deployment : Easy to deploy POJOs and MOJOs to deploy models for fast and accurate scoring in any environment, including with very large models.\n\nLet us first import the necessary modules."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import h2o\nimport time\nimport seaborn\nimport itertools\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom h2o.estimators.glm import H2OGeneralizedLinearEstimator\nfrom h2o.estimators.gbm import H2OGradientBoostingEstimator\nfrom h2o.estimators.random_forest import H2ORandomForestEstimator\n\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fedacbbc386f3a5fdd5b2b9970d77eabdc0af777"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Once the module in imported, the first step is to initialize the h2o module. \n\nThe *h2o.init()* command is pretty smart and does a lot of things.
