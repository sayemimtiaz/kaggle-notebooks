Thus in order to use categorical data along with XGBoost, we have to use One-Hot Encoding to convert a column of categorical data into multiple columns of binary values.\n\n**Question: Why not treat categorical data as continuous data by taking the 3 categories from Contract column as 3 integer values (say 1, 2, 3) ?**\nAnswer: \nThe XGBoost may cluster 2 of the 3 categories now represented as numbers to other categories with number close to the former category.

Example: if my XGBoost model using a categorical variable favoriteColor that has red, blue and green as options, then ColumnTransformer() can remember those options and later on when my XGBoost model is being used in a production system, if someone says their favorite color is orange, then ColumnTransformer() can throw an error or handle the situation in another way. The downside of ColumnTransformer() is that it turns our data into an array and loses all the column names, making it difficult to verify that the usage of our columns works as we intended to.\n\nIn contrast, get_dummies() leaves our data in the form of a dataframe and retains the column names as well.

With the optimized model, out of 1294 people that didn't leave the company only 932 (72 %) were correctly classified. That said this trade off may be better for the company since the people that leave the company take their money with them resulting in the increases in financial losses suffered by the company. So from the company's perspective it would be better to identify such people before they leave and take necessary steps to prevent as many people as possible from leaving consequently reducing the (expected) losses."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Drawing and Interpreting the XGBoost Tree**\n\nIf we need to gain information, such as gain and cover etc, at each node in the first tree, we just build the first tree, otherwise we'll get the average over all of the trees."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"xgb_clf= xgb.XGBClassifier(seed= 42,\n                           objective= 'binary:logistic',\n                           learn_rate= 0.1,\n                           max_depth= 4,\n                           reg_lambda= 10,\n                           scale_pos_weight= 3,\n                           subsample= 0.9,\n                           colsample_bytree= 0.5,\n                           n_estimators= 1)\n# n_estimators set to 1 so that we can get gain, cover etc.\nxgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's print the weight, gain, cover etc for the tree.\n\nweight= number of times a feature is used in a branch or root across all trees\ngain= the average gain across all splits a feature is used in \ncover= the average coverage across all splits a feature is used in \ntotal_gain= the total gain across all splits a feature is used in \ntotal_cover= the total coverage across all splits a feature is used in \n\n**NOTE**: Since only 1 tree is being built :\n    gain= total_gain ; cover= total_cover"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"bst= xgb_clf.get_booster()\n\nfor importance_type in ('weight', 'gain', 'cover', 'total_gain', 'total_cover'):\n    print('%s: ' % importance_type, bst.get_score(importance_type= importance_type))\n    \n    \nnode_params= {'shape': 'box',  # makes the node fancy\n              'style': 'filled, rounded',\n              'fillcolor': '#78cbe'\n             }\n\nleaf_params= {'shape': 'box',\n              'style': 'filled',\n              'fillcolor': '#e48038'}\n\n# NOTE: num_trees is NOT the number of trees to plot, but the specific tree that we are going to plot\n# The default value is 0, but let's set it just to show it since it is counter-intuitive.\n# xgb.to_graphviz(xgb_clf, num_trees= 0, size= \"10, 10\")\n\nxgb.to_graphviz(xgb_clf, num_trees= 0, size= \"10, 10\",\n                condition_node_params= node_params,\n                leaf_node_params= leaf_params)\n\n# TO SAVE THE FIGURE (in jupyter notebook):\n# graph_data= xgb.to_graphviz(xgb_clf, num_trees= 0, size= \"10, 10\",\n#                 condition_node_params= node_params,\n#                 leaf_node_params= leaf_params)\n# graph_data.view(filename= 'insert arbitrary file name as required')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's discuss how to interpret the XGBoost tree.
