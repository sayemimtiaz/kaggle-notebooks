Rather than finding summary statistics about the survey's respondents, I figured I'd try to specifically see how these results could be useful to people like me, who are figuring out how to get started.\n\nIf you're not that interested in the analysis, and just want to **see the collective recommendations of 17,000 industry professionals**, feel free to [click here](#conclusion) to skip to the end.

Conclusion\n<a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n\nIf you're a novice data scientist and you're just looking for somewhere to get started, the graphs we created strongly support a couple of recommendations:\n\n1. **Learn Python.** Both Python and R have been around for decades, but as we can see in [the first graph](#programming_language), Python won out in basically every scenario. This is also backed up by [the fourth graph](#important_job_skills), in which participants overwhelmingly said that Python was the most important skill on the job. I honestly believe you will be hard-pressed to find a company that doesn't use Python at all, so you should be good to go.\n2. **Major in CS and/or Math.** As I mentioned just after creating the [graph of majors vs. job titles](#majors_and_likely_positions), every major has some presence in every role. However, judging from the proportions visible on the bar graph, CS majors and math majors are the most abundant in almost every role. Although it's not a requirement, either or both these majors may give you a bit of an edge.\n3. **Make projects, take courses, and participate in Kaggle challenges.** As we could see in [the graph analyzing the best resources for learning](#resources_for_learning), there were a couple of very clear winners. Creating projects, taking online courses, and participating in Kaggle challenges all took the cake as the three most useful resources for learning about data science.\n4. **Learn about the most widely used tools.** There seems to be a neverending supply of data science tools and libraries, but this survey allowed us to see the ones that were considered the most important. The most recommended tools were Python, SQL, R, Jupyter, and Unix ([click here to see more](#tools_in_the_real_world)), and the most recommended methods to learn were data visualization, [cross validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation), [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree), and [random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) ([click here to see more](#important_job_methods)).\n\nHopefully this helps you figure out where you should get started! I wouldn't consider myself a professional, but if you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer them in the comments.
