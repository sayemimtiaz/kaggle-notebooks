The best proof of this situation is the historical temperature change (It is shown in left figure[⁴](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/comparative-media-studies-writing/cms-631-data-storytelling-studio-climate-change-spring-2017/#)).  Our project investigates the reality of the increase in temperatures linked to industrial activities and the greenhouse effect. And before this investigation, the aim of this part enlight the significant sides of the temperature change data for each area. Before beginning the analysis, firstly, I want to figure out our problem, its cause and its effects in a short way. \n \n #### What is Climate Change?\n \n\"_Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates. Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the early 20th century are primarily driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. These human-produced temperature increases are commonly referred to as global warming._[⁵](https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/)\"\n \n ##### Causes\nAccording to NASA, Water Vapour, Carbon dioxide(CO₂), Methane, Nitrous oxide, Chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs) contribute to the greenhouse effect. Over the last century, human activities have increased concentrations of this natural greenhouse.\n \n ##### Effects:\n\n\"_Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted, and trees are flowering sooner. Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change: loss of sea ice accelerated sea-level rise and longer, more intense heat waves._[⁶](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/)\"\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import HTML\n\nHTML('''<script>\ncode_show=true; \nfunction code_toggle() {\n if (code_show){\n $('div.input').hide();\n } else {\n $('div.input').show();\n }\n code_show = !code_show\n} \n$( document ).ready(code_toggle);\n</script>\nThe raw code for this IPython notebook is by default hidden for easier reading.\nTo toggle on/off the raw code, click <a href=\"javascript:code_toggle()\">here</a>.''')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Content\n1.

The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain includes some extra information in this data set like Area names. Because in this project our key value is country names, I chose to use FAO's data set. <br>\n\nData in the Temperature Change domain can be reachable from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' [web data portal²](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET). According to [the license of FAO Statistical Database Terms of Use](http://www.fao.org/contact-us/terms/db-terms-of-use/en/), the data set can be used for research, statistical, and scientific purposes. It can be access, download, create copies and re-disseminated datasets subject to these Dataset Terms.<br>\n\n_The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain disseminates statistics of mean surface temperature change by country, with annual updates. The current dissemination covers the period 1961–2019. Statistics are available for monthly, seasonal and annual mean temperature anomalies, i.e., temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951–1980. The standard deviation of the temperature change of the baseline methodology is also available._[²](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET/metadata) It includes areas of all the countries and territories of the world. (In 2019: 190 countries and 37 other territorial entities) The data covers monthly, seasonal, yearly temperature changes as Celsius degrees °C between 1961 and 2019. The frequency of dissemination and Release calendar of the data is the yearly base. The format is a comma-separated value (CSV) file, has the tabular format and 6.3 megabytes. It includes 9656 rows and 66 columns.<br> \nWhile the first seven columns include information about temperature changes, the other columns show temperature change numbers between 1961 and 2019. And, all years have some missing values. When I examine the first seven columns detail;\n\n1. **Area Code:**  The numerical code of area column, type of area code is an integer.\n1. **Area:** Countries and Territories (In 2019: 190 countries and 37 other territorial entities.), type of area is an object.\n1. **Months Code:** The numerical code of months column, type of months code is an integer.\n1. **Months:** Months, Seasons, Meteorological year, type of  months is an object.\n    * Months: 'January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July','August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'\n    * Seasons: 'Dec\\x96Jan\\x96Feb', 'Mar\\x96Apr\\x96May', 'Jun\\x96Jul\\x96Aug','Sep\\x96Oct\\x96Nov'\n    * Year: 'Meteorological year'\n1. **Element Code:** The numerical code of element column, type of element code is an integer.\n1. **Element:** 'Temperature change', 'Standard Deviation', type of element is an object.\n1. **Unit:** Celsius degrees °C, type of unit is an object."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data set informations\n\n# read data sets\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/temperature-change/Environment_Temperature_change_E_All_Data_NOFLAG.csv\", encoding='latin-1') # csv file is encoding as latin-1 type\ndf_countrycode=pd.read_csv('../input/temperature-change/FAOSTAT_data_11-24-2020.csv') #this csv file includes ISO-3 Country Code, this mentioned in Data Wrangling \n\n#examine each column and find unique items of Months and Element columns\ndisplay(df.head(5))\nprint('\\n')\n#display(df.info())\nprint('\\n')\nprint(\"Months\")\ndisplay(df.Months.unique())\nprint('\\n')\nprint(\"Elements\")\ndisplay(df.Element.unique())\nprint('\\n')\ndisplay(df_countrycode.head(5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id = \"3\"></a><br>\n\n### Data Wrangling\n\nIn this project, the other project data sets have country codes(ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization[ⁱ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) ). Because of that, I added this from another CSV[³](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions) that is provided by FAOSTAT(the source of main data set). So, I added this ISO-3 codes in my data set as 'Country Code'. Additionally, I encountered a few minor text formatting issues with 'Months' and 'year'. Only a small amount of cleaning and wrangling was required to obtain my visualizations. My cleaning and wrangling activities included:\n\n1. Data columns and some rows rename:<br>\n   I changed the 'Area' columns to 'country names' because it will be key in merging the other project data sets. I changed seasons names in the months' category as:'Dec\\x96Jan\\x96Feb' → 'Winter', 'Mar\\x96Apr\\x96May' → 'Spring', 'Jun\\x96Jul\\x96Aug' → 'Summer','Sep\\x96Oct\\x96Nov'→'Fall'. Because year was written like 'Y1961', I splitted 'Y' and using the other part of 'year'.\n\n1. Deleting of columns and some rows:<br>\n   The 'Area Code', 'Months','Elemet Code' columns are a unique identifier of each row which does not provide any statistical information. And, each of the 'Unit' column show 'Celsius degrees °C' so I do not need this information as a column. Also, in this analysis I do not use 'Standart Deviation', so after filtering all  'Temperature change'rows, the 'Element' column also deleted. \n   \n1. Manipulating data frame:<br>\n   As I mentioned above to make standart all data sets in the project, I added ISO-3 Country Code in my data. I merged 'Country Code' with my data set. Visualization and making analysis easier, I organized the data frames. I gathered all years' columns in the 'year' column. \n   "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#1.

According to my guiding question answers, when examining the top ten areas that have the highest temperature change in the last decade are mostly industrialized countries. Additionally, I found that temperature increased every ten decades, and the last decade can count as the hottest decade. From our above analysis result, I came up winter season getting more hotter.  Finally,  I tried to show how temperature is increasing worldwide as a proof of global warming. In the next section with these and the other outputs, we will analyze deeper climate change effects. As a visualization of these results, I added an animation map; this shows how climate change gets serious year by year. For the map, I added one more column in a different data frame; this column categorized each temperature change with half-point intervals. And, I used warmer colours for zero and above, colder colour zero and below.
