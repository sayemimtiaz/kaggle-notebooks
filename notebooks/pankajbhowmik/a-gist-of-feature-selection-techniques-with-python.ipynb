It reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret. It improves the accuracy of a model if the right subset is chosen. [3]\n**Feature Selection is one of the core concepts in Data Science & Machine Learning which have hugely impact the performance of a model**. The data features that are used to train machine learning models have a huge influence on the performance.\nThe problem we often face is to identify the related features from a set of data and removing the irrelevant or less important features with do not contribute much to our target variable in order to achieve better accuracy for our model. [1]\n\nIn this notebook, I shed some light on some useful feature selection techniques simply you can use in Machine Learning. I will be using Python programming language in this case with sklearn.\n\nFeature Selection Methods\n\nHere, three feature selection techniques that are easy to use and also gives good results will be discussed.\n\n0. Feature Correlation Matrix [.corr()]\n1. Univariate Selection [SelectKBest with chi²]\n2. Feature Importance [.feature_importances_]\n\nLet’s explore these techniques one by one with an example dataset, \"Breast Cancer Risk Prediction\". You can download the dataset from [HERE](http://https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
