In this notebook, the following things are taken as grounding hypotheses:\n\n- **No universal COVID-19 test or testing method exists**, which means the number of new COVID-19 cases in different regions may vary greatly depending on test, method and regional testing policy. \n- **No generally accepted single model or method on predicting COVID-19 spread exists**, because they all are currently being tested and validated in real-time.\n- **The COVID-19 confirmed case data is not collected the same way in different places**, which leaves plenty of room for subjective interpretation.\n- **The COVID-19 death rate data includes mostly diagnosed hospitalized patients**, often leaving other possible covid-caused death incidents outside the data.\n- **Recent COVID-19 studies in the U.S. suggest that COVID-19 pandemic started there earlier than suspected**, which may be true also in other areas such as Northern Italy.\n- **COVID-19 infection rate is - according to recent research - higher than suspected**, meaning the actual number of people infected may be 7-10 times higher than in datasets currently in use.\n- **As most viruses are, COVID-19 is suspected to be more infectious in winter compared to summer.** This is notable when for example outbreaks in South America (most of the continent is located below equator) are studied.\n\nIn this notebook, only two aspects related to COVID-19 are analyzed: the reported number of hospitalizations and the reported number of recovered patients. The term 'recovered' is interpreted in this notebook the same as 'discharged from hospital'. In reality, COVID-19 patients may have a recovery period lasting several weeks or even months after being discharged from hospital.\n\nWith a simple comparison, in this notebook a closer look is taken at **how and when the number of recovered patients correlate with the total number of hospitalized patients in different regions.**\n\nThe regions included in this notebook are Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna , Piemonte and Veneto in Italy as well as the state of New York in United States."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.1 Summary of conclusions"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Below is a summary of primary conclusions in this notebook:\n\n- **In regions included in this notebook, the 'first wave' of COVID-19 as a whole lasted about three months.**\n- **The incline of the curve was about one month long, and it took about two months for hospitalizations to decline on the same level as before the outbreak.**  \n- **The apex plateau phase lasted for 9-18 days.**\n- **The decreasing demand for ICU beds was the first sign of downcurrent.**\n- **The decreasing demand for hospital care does not mean that new positive confirmed COVID-19 decrease at the same rate.**\n- **After three months, the demand for hospitalization had settled on about 5-15 percent compared to peak demand during the apex.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.

with numerous different methods and practices - that new cases will not be analyzed further in this notebook. What is notable however is the number of positive confirmed COVID-19 cases after the hospitalization peak (around April 1st).\n\nAs one can see below, there has been a steady flow of new positive cases in all four Italian regions although the hospitalization rate has at the same time decreased. In Lombardy the number of new cases was around 45K on April 1st, when the hospitalization apex was reached. Yet a month later, the cumulative number of new cases in the region was over 76K despite of the downcurrent in hospitalizations.\n\nThis means that **in April the number of new monthly COVID-19 cases in Lombardy decreased only 20 percent compared to March (about 10K cases, from 45K new cases found in March to over 35K new cases found in April). However, the number of total hospitalizations in Lombardy decreased from 13K to 7K - almost 50 percent - during the same time.** \n\nFour regions in Italy is of course a small sample and changes in testing rate have their own effect on the numbers, but based on that data it can be argued that ***hospitalizations and new COVID-19 cases don't actually correlate with each other as absolute values***.

Therefore looking at new cases with for example 5-day average would be one way of avoiding these 'waves' or 'steps' in new cases. Since the downcurve of a modern era pandemic is by and large an unknown research subject as for now, it may well be possible that - instead of a steady downcurve - new COVID-19 positive cases will gradually decrease in wave-like pattern and eventually fade away like high frequency harmonics in bass sound waveform.\n\nIt's good to keep in mind though that in every region, only a small fraction of all people has been tested for COVID-19. In Italy testing has concentrated - largely by necessity - on patients showing clear COVID-19 symptoms. The number of unsymptomatic infected people has so far been a rough estimate, but drawing on clinical studies carried out in New York state, in urban areas the total number of COVID-19 positive people may be some 7-10 times higher than actual testing suggests.

relatively small overall number of patients in Veneto. In fact, in Veneto region the peak apex phase lasted for 9 days, which is half of the one in Lombardy.\n\nFrom May 10th onwards, there seems to have been a regional update on collected data, which lowered both regular ward and ICU patient numbers considerably. What the numbers tell us is that on May 10th, the hospitalization rate in Veneto region was on the same level as in the first week of March, some two months ago before the upward curve started to rise steeply. \n\nGenerally speaking, in Italy the need for ICU has started to decrease before overall need for hospital beds. Of course there is the unfortunate loss of lives included in this, but when indicators for 'bending the curve' are generally being looked at, consistently reduced need for ICU might be one of the first factors.\n\nConcluding the analysis, the four regions in Italy all had the following characteristics:\n\n- **The upward curve lasted for about a month**, keeping in mind that the regions included in the analysis all suffered a rapid outbreak. \n- **The apex plateau phase lasted for 9-18 days**, likely depending on the total number of population in a specific region.\n- **The downcurrent of the curve is more gentle than the upward curve**, because the upward phase in many regions in Italy was more or less uncontained i.e. very steep.\n- **The COVID-19 spread upward curves in Northern Italy may be misleadingly steep**, because it is possible that COVID-19 began spreading there earlier than thought.\n- **The decreasing demand for ICU beds is the first sign of downcurrent**, partly because of the high mortality rate of patients intubated and put on ventilators.\n- **In four weeks after reaching the apex, the need for hospitalization in all four Italian regions had reduced about 50 percent. Six weeks after the apex, the same number was some 75 percent lower compared to apex. Thus the post-apex hospitalization came down about 25 percent from apex level every two weeks (or 12.5 percent/week).**\n- **The decreasing demand for hospital care does not mean that new positive confirmed COVID-19 decrease at the same rate**, which underlines the importance of caution during the regional reopening process.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3. New York State"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In New York state, the COVID-19 pandemic started some time later than in Italy. However, **as in Italy, it has been suggested that COVID-19 actually began spreading in New York well before the pandemic was officially recognized there. Therefore the steep rise of new cases in the pre-apex phase of the outbreak was likely affected by notable backlog in testing, and in reality the upward curve of new positive COVID-19 cases was more gentle.**\n\nJust like Italy, New York state is basically a story of two different COVID-19 outbreaks. The city of New York soon became the most followed COVID-19 hotspot, since the hospitalization numbers there were off-scale compared to other regions. The upstate regions have less dense population, with many counties being basically rural areas. This has also affected the reopening process in New York state. Because of less dense population, the northern upstate areas are bound to meet the state reopening criteria much sooner than the metropolis region in the south. This will inevitably create challenges on how to prevent new COVID-19 cases spreading from southern regions to upstate during the summer months. \n\nBelow is the plot of the *hospitalizedCurrently* column from New York state, presenting hospitalizations after May 1st.

As we can see above, this is only partially true. For example New York state has launched an extensive testing and tracing program of late, but the new cases curve has more or less remained steady. Thus, from this viewpoint, **COVID-19 testing equals to monitoring or observing the virus by using scientific method. The results of that observation (in this case positive/negative test results) do not directly affect the phenomenon observed.**\n\n***The only way testing process can affect future COVID-19 spread is what happens based on the test results (isolating patients, contact tracing, regional restrictions etc). Considering COVID-19 testing rate only as a final goal or an intrinsic value will not render any significant improvement in limiting future virus spread without further action based on test results.***\n\nFinally, ***the act of testing itself does not cure COVID-19 or increase a single infection to the total number of positive COVID-19 cases: the person tested positive was already ill before the test. Testing only makes the total number more accurate and relevant considering the actual community spread as well as reducing potential future cases by giving the chance to isolate people tested positive in time.***\n\nThis is why collecting more data on post-apex COVID-19 infections is essential. ***Why so many people still get infected even in a lockdown? What are the demographics (age etc.)?***\n\nSo far New York state has collected a couple of thousand cases on this very matter. As the state was under stay-at-home order during the study, home unsurprisingly shows up as the primary source of COVID-19 infection. *How did the virus enter those homes is however the question that should be answered before any restrictions can be safely lifted.*\n\nIf the data from Lombardy region is used as comparison (it is the largest of the four Italian regions analyzed), **the downcurve in New York will likely be a relatively long period with lingering demand for regular ward hospital care**. In the four regions in Italy, the demand for hospital care dropped 50 percent during the first month following the apex (in Italy's case April). However, it took only a month (in Italy's case March) for hospitalization care to increase from practically zero to apex. Also, **the hospitalization demand is likely to settle on a certain level at some point, since new COVID-19 cases won't totally stop from emerging.**\n\nRecent studies both from Europe and United States suggest that **COVID-19 existed in both Europe and United States for several weeks before the outbreak was actually detected.** Drawing on this, it can be argued that in every region there can be a certain, manageable \"safety level\" of individual COVID-19 cases that do not cause a regional outbreak ('outbreak' defined here as consistent 1.0+ infection rate (Rt) ). *Finding out what that level is will be crucial in living with COVID-19 in the near future.*  \n\nAnother notion - not based on any plots in this notebook but still provable - is quite an obvious one. Both in Italy and in New York state, ***the most reliable factor in predicting the number of deaths seems to be the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases***. Although these two are not plotted in this particular notebook, I have done so elsewhere, and the two are basically identical by shape in all analyzed regions. Also, ***in Veneto the first day of the post-apex curve with zero deaths (June 10) was the same exact day when no new positive COVID-19 cases were recorded in the region (it was also the first day with no ICU patients).***\n\nThus **the only effective way to reduce COVID-19 deaths seems to be reducing the number of new infections**, which of course is pretty much common sense (now backed up by data). Of course there is a delay between COVID-19 deaths and new cases, but as long as the overall COVID-19 mortality rate stays somewhere between 1-4 percent, the number of new future deaths is actually quite predictable if the number of new cases is known.\n\nAt the same time, **the reducing need for hospital care does not mean that there would be no new positive COVID-19 cases**. Although social distancing has slowed down the outbreak, COVID-19 has continued to spread among people both in Italy and in New York state. ***The lockdown measures have been successful in slowing down the current infection rate. Yet many of those \"curbed infections\" are still likely to take place at some point in the future, as the virus is still as infectious as before, no cure for it exists and there is no herd immunity.***\n\nHowever - with the hospitalization rate on downfall - the data seems to suggest that as for now ***the recent COVID-19 cases are mostly found among people less vulnerable to the virus, thus not in need for hospital care.***\n\nIn the latter half of April (first two weeks after apex), New York state had about 30 percent less new COVID-19 cases than in two weeks leading to apex (first half of April). At the same time, the number of daily hospitalizations in New York state decreased about 40 percent (from 18.5K to 11.5K). Losing lives is a sad part of this difference, but it seems that the ***more recent COVID-19 cases do not require hospitalization or ICU care as often as those found at the beginning of outbreak. The situation changes only if these less vulnerable people cause a rapid community outbreak by infecting the elderly etc. (which was exactly what happened for example in Lombardy in March).***\n\nOne question (left strictly to professional virologists) is whether COVID-19 - while transforming itself into less vulnerable people - has gone through significant mutations in this process. Viruses are not very good at the process of multiplication, leading to gradually mutating forms. The key is however that *all viruses primarily aim at multiplying themselves, not destroying themselves by causing their host to perish.* \n\n***So far the generally accepted rule of thumb has been that the more infectious a virus becomes, the less lethal it transforms to. Thus stating that a more infectious COVID-19 mutation is automatically 'worse' can be misleading.*** \n\nIf and when all this has an effect to COVID-19 mortality rate in the future, it remains to be seen. It is also possible that with future mutations, COVID-19 may cause different non-respiratory illnesses among demographics previously considered mostly unaffected by the virus (small children, adolescents), as recent studies around the world seem to suggest. For better or worse, this would eventually render COVID-19 more of a general health scare than a primarily respiratory illness.\n\nConcluding the notebook, if New York state follows the timeline set by the four regions in Italy (especially Lombardy), the following can be stated:\n\n- **Since the COVID-19 outbreak really took off in New York state halfway into March, the upward part of the curve happened roughly from March 15th to April 15th. It is likely however that the COVID-19 spread in New York city and other metro areas in the state began earlier than that.**\n\n- **Because of the large number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York state, the exact timeline or shape of the downcurrent is hard to predict.**\n\n- **During gradual reopening, everything depends on fast containment of possible new positive COVID-19 clusters.**\n\n- **When the number of COVID-19 related deaths in New York state (especially densely populated downstate metro areas) fall on the same level as for example combined daily driver, cyclist and pedestrian traffic deaths, COVID-19 will eventually be considered by general public as an acceptable risk and an inevitable part of everyday life.**"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
