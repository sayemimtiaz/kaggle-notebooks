Text summarization <a id=\"section4\"></a>\n\nPrevious sections have been focused into reducing the amount of information from papers so that anyone interested in the subject can focus on certain papers, and identify in a simple look which words are meant in the Conclusion section. However, sometimes working with the whole paper may be mandatory, hence requiring an alternative method to reduce the workload when reviewing papers. To tackle this problem we'll use text summarization.\n\nText summarization seeks to extract the most relevant information from a text, and it can be achieved through two different approaches:\n* **Extractive**. Select a subset of words that retain the most important points, then select sentences with higher weights.\n* **Abstractive**. Based on semantic understanding, the model aims to produce a completely new text, shorter than the original document but with the same message.\n\nI'll proceed with extractive summarization given that in most cases we are interested in complete literal sentences from the papers, besides it's faster and the implementation is relatively simple. The main workflow that we will follow is:\n\n1. **Word scoring**. Compute the term frequency - inverse frequency document ([TFIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)) score for each word in the document\n2. **Split**. Split the paper's text into sentences, using dot and line break as delimiters\n3. **Sentence scoring**. Use text rank, with the sentence score based on word scores. Filter out sentences with >50 words\n4. **Summary**. The summary consists on the top 10 sentences with higher score\n\nWith this approach, the maximum summary length is 500 words, which is a reasonable number given that abstracts usually range from 100 to 500 words. \n\nLet's see an example for the paper [Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection by Detection of Nucleocapsid Protein running title: Diagnosis of COVID-19 by N antigen detection](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524v2.full.pdf).

Exploration of COVID-19 papers by topic <a id=\"section3\"></a>\n\nTechniques reviewed in the previous sections have proven their utility, but now it's time to apply them and analyze the content of the papers. The main idea is to characterize some topics of the articles, so that we are able to understand which factors are more important in each of them. \n\nRemind that our final objective is to answer some of the open question about the COVID-19 spread, and to help scientists when dealing with the huge set of articles related to this topic. Hence, to facilitate access to the different tasks of the challenge, each of them will be covered in a separated subsection:\n\n1. What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?\n2. What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?\n3. What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?\n4. Sample task with sample submission\n5. What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?\n6. What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?\n7. What has been published about ethical and social science considerations?\n8. What do we know about diagnostics and surveillance?\n9. What has been published about medical care?\n10.
