A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n\nThe dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n\nRun the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project.

On the contrary, high variance means that it's overfitting, which means it overlooks at small differences in the data and is oversensitive.\n\nFor instance, when the maximum depth is 1, there is high bias. The model is not correlated to the actual data precisely. This can be seen visually that the training score is distanced away from one. This means that the model didn't fit itself to the training data accurately.\n\nOn the other hand, when the maximum depth is 10, there is high variance. The model is too sensitive to the training data. The decision tree model uses too many intricate rules that are too specific to the data and don't accurately capture the features. Visually, this can be inferred from the model having a perfect one training score although it's distant from the testing score, which is at around 0.65. \n\nOverall, the optimal balance is when the training score is close to perfect, i.e. 1, and is proximate to the testing score.

In addition to using a training and testing datasets for validation, we are splitting the complete dataset k times into training and testing. This means each data point will be used for training k-1 times and for testing once. As k increases, the variance in the result decreases, retaining a more accurate validation. Intuitivially, this means we're not relying on any particular subset of the data for testing, we are checking our model on all parts of the data, in comparison to the remaining data used for training. \n\nWe need to choose the number of splits correctly, because too many splits means we are computationally expensive, as it means we are performing multiple operations from scratch. Yet, if we split into too little chunks, i.e. many splits, the cross validation wouldn't be as accurate since our testing set would be too small compared to the training set.\n\nDuring the last step, we are taking the avearge of the k results to produce the estimator. We get an error rate for each fold, or part, of the dataset and, for each model, take that average and compare to the average of other models. Finally, we can compare this error rate to untouched data to check its accuracy, as the average error rate from cross validation still has some bias.\n\nIn this project we are using a single model, i.e. Decision Tree Algorithm, to train our data. We are optimizing it using grid search, as mentioned in question 7, to pick the best 'max_depth' based on the error rates for each depth. We could have used an additional model, such as polynomial regression, and check its average error rate compares to the decision tree algorithm, and then we would have decided between the two, which is the optimal one for use in this dataset.\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c4110cc0-f77b-4479-8c2d-b051be8af241","_uuid":"ab37a8b30462095892c7570c801dfa2a178120a1"},"outputs":[],"source":"### Implementation: Fitting a Model\nYour final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n\nIn addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n\nPlease note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\nFor the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":false,"_uuid":"13b00639a5b2e461055141e161ca40e9d8b40950","_cell_guid":"f625a7f2-24a7-4003-9307-0b258bfc1477"},"outputs":[],"source":"# TODO: Import 'make_scorer', 'DecisionTreeRegressor', and 'GridSearchCV'\nfrom sklearn.metrics import make_scorer\nfrom sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\ndef fit_model(X, y):\n    \"\"\" Performs grid search over the 'max_depth' parameter for a \n        decision tree regressor trained on the input data [X, y]. \"\"\"\n    \n    # Create cross-validation sets from the training data\n    cv_sets = ShuffleSplit(X.shape[0], test_size = 0.20, random_state = 0)\n\n    # TODO: Create a decision tree regressor object\n    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor()\n\n    # TODO: Create a dictionary for the parameter 'max_depth' with a range from 1 to 10\n    params = {  'max_depth': [i+1 for i in range(10)]  }\n\n    # TODO: Transform 'performance_metric' into a scoring function using 'make_scorer' \n    scoring_fnc = make_scorer(performance_metric)\n\n    # TODO: Create the grid search object\n    grid = GridSearchCV(regressor, param_grid=params, cv=cv_sets, scoring=scoring_fnc)\n\n    # Fit the grid search object to the data to compute the optimal model\n    grid = grid.fit(X, y)\n\n    # Return the optimal model after fitting the data\n    return grid.best_estimator_"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cdcaac02-ab9a-4d81-a83b-408ef8f8c3c1","_uuid":"feace7e659d6b1f541917b12c9a6ae1d2145c1e9"},"outputs":[],"source":"### Making Predictions\nOnce a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used to make predictions on new sets of input data.
