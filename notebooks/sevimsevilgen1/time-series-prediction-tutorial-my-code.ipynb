These processes can be called **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.\n* After that, we will focus on **time series prediction** to predict when bombing operations are done. \n* For time series prediction, we will use **ARIMA** method that will be a tutorial. \n \n <br> <font color='blue'> Content: \n    * [Load the Data](#1)\n    * [Data Description](#2)\n    * [Data Cleaning](#3)\n    * [Data Visualization](#4)\n    * [Time Series Prediction with ARIMA](#5)\n        * [ What is Time Series ?](#6)\n        * [Stationarity of a Time Series](#7)\n        * [Make a Time Series Stationary](#8)\n            * Moving Average method\n            * Differencing method\n        * [Forecasting a Time Series](#9)\n    * [Conclusion](#10)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns # visualization library\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # visualization library\nimport plotly as py\n#import plotly.plotly as py\nimport plotly.tools as plotly_tools # visualization library\nimport chart_studio.plotly as py\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot # plotly offline mode\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True) \nimport plotly.graph_objs as go # plotly graphical object\n\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\nimport plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n# import warnings library\nimport warnings        \n# ignore filters\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\") # if there is a warning after some codes, this will avoid us to see them.\nplt.style.use('ggplot') # style of plots. ggplot is one of the most used style, I also like it.\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1\"></a> <br>\n## Load the Data\n* As I mentioned at introduction, we use multiple data sources.\n    * Aerial Bombing Operations in WW2\n        * Shortly, this data includes bombing operations.
