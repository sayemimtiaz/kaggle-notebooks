(SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't go very well)**\n\nThe Airbnb dataset has 3 csv files: \"calendar.csv\", \"listings.csv\", \"reviews.csv\". I first create an LSTM model in Keras and train it on the IMDB sentiment dataset. Then I use the trained model on the comments from \"reviews.csv\" to predict sentiment: either positive (1), or negative (0). Taking the average of these, I see how closely this correlates to the actual ratings, found in \"listings.csv\".\n\nA couple things of note: the initial sentiment analysis is a classification task, whereas predicting the rating is really a regression task. My intention is to see how closely we can correlate these.\n\nAlso, since this is my first Kaggle submission, note that I really like functions. I primarily program in Spyder, so writing functions allows for easy and discrete code chunks, and makes debugging much easier."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport string\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport keras\nfrom keras.models import Sequential, save_model, load_model\nfrom keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Flatten\nfrom keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport datetime\nimport math","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e566bab431dd65ac4e4af1cc2c923f28aa214a4b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we load in the IMDB dataset.

Each of the reviews is assigned their respective sentiment (negative = 0, positive = 1). We loaded these all into one dataframe, `cleaned_imdb`.\n* We loaded our GloVe model as `embedding_dict`, which has 400,000 lowercase words. Each of these words is mapped to a 50-dimensional vector space.\n* We stripped all punctuation and extra whitespace from the IMDB reviews and created the `stripped_imdb` dataframe. This allows us to actually represent the words within the reviews in the vector space given by the GloVe model.\n* By plotting a histogram of the length of each of the IMDB reviews, we were able to determine an appropriate maximum length to feed our `tokenizer`. This prevents it from having to carry around a bunch of `0`'s just to match the length of one very wordy review.\n* We converted the words in each review to integers and captured them in the list `integer_reviews`. Computers like numbers a lot more than words, so this will allow our model to actually train on the reviews.\n* Finally, we padded `0`'s at the beginning of every review - up to our `imdb_sequence_length` of 1000 - determined from our histogram plot and created the array `padded_reviews`"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3982d3b2cac325a0f475e4de6186d3c599033e4f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Great!

We create a `for` loop to run through each of the listing IDs in `ids_gt_100`, find them in the `df_reviews` dataframe, and then run through the exact same sequence of preprocessing as we did for the IMDB dataset - makes it helpful that we defined all of these functions above. At the end, however, instead of training a model, we use our `LSTM_model` to make predictions of sentiment and collect them in a `ratings` dictionary. The `ratings` dictionary will have the `listing_id` as the key (which we call `temp_id` in the loop), and a list of `[actual_rating, predicted_rating]` as the values.\n\nOne thing I will note, I chose an `airbnb_sequence_length` of 250, as opposed to the `imdb_sequence_length` of 1000. When I ran this through originally, I plotted similar histograms to the IMDB dataset of each of the listing IDs, and found 250 was a pretty consistent cutoff in terms of length.
