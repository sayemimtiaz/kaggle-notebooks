Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon .\n\n## Problems Explaination\nWe are given all the different gasture images considered in ASL (Americal Sign Language) and we need to come up with a machine learning model wich can classifiy the images correctly ,or can tell us the class to which the given image belongs.\nBasically we will be building a image classification model . \n<br>\n## Data information\nwe are given 2 comma saperated file(.csv) each on them contains some rows and 785 columns\n* from 2nd columns onwards each column represents the pixel values associated , representing a 28x28 grayscale image\n* first column in each row represnts label with the image\n* There are total 24 lables (in american sign language) A-I,K-Y means A-Z except J and Z\n\nwe will be using cnn to solve this problem .\n\n## What is an convolution neural network\nA Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.\n<br>\nA Cnn consists of 4 types of nueral layers (collection of 'nodes' operating together at a specific depth within a neural network) .\n* **Convolutional Layer** :  Used to detect features\n* **Non-Linearity Layer** :  Introducing non-linearity to the system\n* **Pooling (Downsampling) Layer** :  Reduces weight count and checks fitness\n* **Flattening Layer** :  Prepares data for Classical Neural Network\n* **Fully-Connected Layer** :  Standard Neural Network used in classification\nI'll not go in depth of each of these layers we will be more focused towards solving this problem,i.e implementation part.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# import
