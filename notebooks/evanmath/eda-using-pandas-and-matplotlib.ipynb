The $R^2$ quantifies how our model's MSE compares to a naive model in which we always predict the mean $y$ value, $\\bar{y}$.\n\n$$ 1 - \\frac{\\sum_i \\left[f(X_i) - y_i\\right]^2}{\\sum_i\\left(\\bar{y} - y_i\\right)^2} $$\n\nIf our $R^2 < 0$ we know our model is very bad, because the MSE is larger than than the MAE of the mean model.\n\nOne important consideration when choosing a metric is how they scale with the data. One note for $R^2$ is that, it seems to get better and better as long as we add more features. But this most of the time is not very good for our model. So beyond the $R^2$ we calculate the $R^2 adjusted$ which is a modified version of $R^2$ that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. The $R^2 adjusted$ increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance. The $R^2 adjusted$ can be negative, but it’s usually not. It is always lower than the $R^2$."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4dc1b4b2e2701787963fe4f1f1ba62ba21623982"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
