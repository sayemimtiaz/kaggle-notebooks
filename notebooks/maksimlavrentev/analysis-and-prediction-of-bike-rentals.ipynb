We will also explore the performance of several ML algorythms for prediction of the number of hourly rentals. We will use the following models: linear regression ,decision tree and random forest. We will also utilize k-means clustering algorythm for grouping the weather parameters.\n\nThe dataset was pulled from the [UCI website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). It contains information on hourly bike rentals, weather parameters and some datetime features. It was combined by Hadi Fanaee-T for his research article [Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3), which was done in collaboration with Joao Gama. \n\nThe data set was obtained by combining bike rental logs in Washington D.C. from [Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) with [weather parameters](http://www.freemeteo.com) and [holiday schedule](http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule). All the logs are aggregated on an hourly level.\n\nData fields:\n\n- instant: record index\n- dteday : date\n- season : season (1:winter, 2:spring, 3:summer, 4:fall)\n- yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)\n- mnth : month ( 1 to 12)\n- hr : hour (0 to 23)\n- holiday : weather day is holiday or not (extracted from [Web Link])\n- weekday : day of the week\n- workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.\n- weathersit :\n    - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy\n    - 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist\n    - 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds\n    - 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog\n- temp : Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-8, t_max=+39 (only in hourly scale)\n- atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-16, t_max=+50 (only in hourly scale)\n- hum: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)\n- windspeed: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)\n- casual: count of casual users\n- registered: count of registered users\n- cnt: count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered\n\n## Preliminary data exploration\n\nBefore we start with analysis of bike rentals, we need to understand some specifics of the data and do data cleaning if necessary. As the dataset was used for a [research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3), it should be already cleaned. However, we might still encounter some pecularities, which we should take into account in our analysis.\n\nFirst, let's load all libraries and read the data:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"white\")\n%matplotlib inline\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndf_raw = pd.read_csv(\"../input/bike-sharing-dataset/hour.csv\", parse_dates = [\"dteday\"])\ndf_raw.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Number of rows: {}\\nNumber of columns: {}\".format(*df_raw.shape))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have 17379 rows and 17 columns in our data set:\n\n- Calendar fields\n\n    For convenience, we will combine 'dteday' and 'hr' as a datetime field. Fields 'season', 'yr', 'mnth' and 'weekday' could be obtained from field 'dteday'. We can already notice that 'weekday' is not in the standard format where 0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday. To avoid any error in our analysis, we will substitute it with the standard.\n\n    'Workingday' feld was obtained by combining weekends with holidays in a way that would allow to classify days as working or non-working.\n    \n\n- Weather fields\n\n    From the Hadi Fanaee-T's article, we know that there were missing weather reports for some hours, which were filled by the closest reports.\n\n    'Weathersit' column was also created by the authors of the data set: it grades the weather conditions provided in the weather data as good, cloudy, bad and very bad. The methodology of ranking was not described, but the discription of the field suggests that it was produced by aggregating qualitative data from the weather web site. We will study the weathersit labels in the next part of our analysis.\n    \n\n- Bike rentals fields\n\n    We have 3 fields: 'casual', 'registered' and their sum 'cnt'. Whe will not use the first two parameters in this study; therefore, we can drop them.\n    \n\n- Instant field\n\n    The 'instant' field might be useful for us as it shows the order of logs. However, we need to check if there is any missing hourly log in the dataset and decide what to do with it. Missing logs might occur if there were no rentals during that hour, if there was a downtime, or in case of change from summer to winter time.\n\n\nIn this part of the analysis we will do the following:\n\n1. remove the unnecessary fields\n2. check for duplicates and nulls\n3. add 'hr' to 'dteday' datetime field and check correctness if calendar data labels\n4. inspect missing logs\n\n___\n1.

We will not try to convert it to the format of data to datetime frequency because it will require us to fill in the missing weather info. However, we will change 'instant' column so that it contains the information that there were missing logs. It might be helpful for regression models. \n\nMoreover, we can label the found events as anomalies in order to gain some marginal improvement of prediction models in the future by dropping these rows as noize. We'll not spend more time on events labeling as it is not the main focuse in this analysis.\n\nLet's finish our preliminary study with transformation of the 'instant' column.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['instant'] = df.set_index('dteday').asfreq('1H').reset_index().dropna().index\ndf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Understanding the trend\n\nWe have already seen that the bkie rentals are affected by both time and weather parameters. It is also greatly reliant on the external events, such as holidays, weather anomalies, political events. Moreover, it is dependant on the number of stations, bicycles, city planning, transport situation, pollution, change of social habits etc. \n\nIf we think of bike rentals as a function of time and weather, we can come to the following thoughts:\n1. Bikerentals should be more dependent on weather, than on time. But weather parameters change with time: there is yearly and daily seasonalities, and might be some more, which could be dictated by relative earth positions in space and processes in the Sun and the Earth's core.\n2. Most people show different behavioral patterns on working days, weekends and holidays. But these patterns vary with the weather conditions and the length of a day. \n3. The actual numbers of bike rentals might be constrained by the capacity of the system. It might grow with the development of the bike rental system. It can also be changing over time due to the changes in social demands and perception of bike rentals. \n\nOverall, we can expect to see some general trendline, which is time dependant, and seasonalities, which are time and weather dependant. \n\nLet's look at the change of bike rentals over time at different aggregation levels to study the patterns.

Bike rentals frequency distribution by temperature (orange area) is more skewed to the left than the frequency of temperatures (grey area) - this speaks of the fact that people prefer to cycle at higher temperatures.\n\nWe also see that lower humidity is also better for cycling. Yet, such cases are relatively rare. When they occur, there is more demand for bicycle rental services.\n\nLooking at the change of rentals with the increase of windspeed, we can think of the following explanation: wind is on average slower in the nights, or at mild weather conditions, when the demand for bike sharing is also lower on average. This explains the mean rentals at less windy times being not the highest. However, when it is more windy, rentals start decreasing as well.
