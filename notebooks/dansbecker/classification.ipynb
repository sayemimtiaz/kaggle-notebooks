This type of modeling is called **regression**, hence the \"Regressor\" part of `RandomForestRegressor`.\n\nAnother common problem you'll see is making a choice between mutually exclusive outcomes. For example, spam detection is predicting whether an email is \"spam\" or \"not spam\" based on the email's content. This type of modeling is called **classification**.\n\nThere are two types of classification: binary (choosing between two classes) and multiclass (choosing between more than two classes). In general there are different approaches to the two types of classification, but most multiclass models will also work for binary problems.\n\nIt's straightforward to build classification models using what you already know about scikit-learn. Instead of `RandomForestRegressor`, you will use `RandomForestClassifier`. \n\nAs an example of classification with `RandomForestClassifier`, I'll use a dataset of phone features to predict a phone's price range. The targets in the data have values:\n\n * 0 (low cost)\n * 1 (medium cost)\n * 2 (high cost)\n * 3 (very high cost)\n \nThe features are things like\n\n* battery_power: Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh\n* blue: Has bluetooth or not\n* clock_speed: speed at which microprocessor executes instructions\n* dual_sim: Has dual sim support or not\n* fc: Front Camera mega pixels\n* four_g: Has 4G or not\n* ....\n\nHere is a quick overview of the data"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nimport sklearn.metrics as metrics\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/mobile-price-classification/train.csv')\ndata.head()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"data.columns"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"We create our feature and targets the same as before using `train_test_split`.

The diagonal tells us how many of each class the model predicted correctly. The off-diagonals show where the model is making wrong predictions, where it is \"confused.\" For example, looking at the first column and second row, we classified four phones that were actually low cost as medium cost. We see for classes 0 and 3, the low cost and highest cost phones, our model works really well, above 90% accurate. However, our model is weaker for medium and high cost phones. Note that incorrect predictions are only between adjacent classes. The model doesn't confuse low cost and very high cost phones."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Class probabilities \n\nClassification models actually calculate a *probability distribution* over the classes. Using `model.predict` simply returns the class with the highest probability. This might not be ideal based on how the decision affects your metrics or downstream measures.

Assume the third option would result in \\\\$100 of profit while the fourth option would return \\\\$150 in profit. Then the expected monetary values are $0.42* \\$100 = \\$42$ and $0.36*\\$150 = \\$54$.
