The goal is to discuss the main features of a number of classification algorithms without going into too much detail, and demonstrate how they are implemented in python. Since this is intended for my own personal use, the questions and confusions I address will be unique to my own background and experience. Nonetheless, I hope that others studying to enter data science will find this a convenient reference in their own data science journeys. Questions and comments are always appreciated! For those that found this notebook useful, I also recommend refering to my notes on [regression algorithms](https://www.kaggle.com/michaelgeracie/modelling-overview-regression) and [clustering algorithms](https://www.kaggle.com/michaelgeracie/modelling-overview-clustering).\n\nWe will use the following conventions throughout. The training data is given by a set of $m$ numerical features $\\mathbf x_j \\in \\mathbb R^n$ where $j = \\{ 1 , \\dots , m \\}$. We will sometimes denote feature vectors using the bold face vector notation just given, and sometimes use components. The $i$th feature of the $j$th training sample is then $x_{ij} = (\\mathbf x_j )_i$ where $i \\in \\{ 1 , \\dots , n\\}$. The features may be real valued or categorical, and if the $i$th feature is categorical, that component will be labelled by some subset $ C \\subseteq \\mathbb Z$ of the integers. \n\nTo date we have covered the following algorithms. The treatment of each is not exhaustive and I hope to come back later to address important aspects of these models that I'm glossing over now. \n\n## 1) Naive Bayes\n## 2) Logistic Regression\n## 3) Decision Trees\n## 4) Random Forests\n## 5) $k$-Nearest Neighbors\n## 6) Support Vector Classifiers\n## 7) XGBoost\n## 8) AdaBoost\n\nA special thanks to Ken Jee whose notebook [Titanic Project Example](https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/titanic-project-example) has helped many lerners including myself begin their data science journeys by collecting a number of applied classification algorithms in one place.

That is, given a feature vector $\\mathbf x$ it produces the conditional probability $P(y|\\mathbf x)$ that the dependent variable $y$ has a given value, given that the feature vector is $\\mathbf x$. To turn this into a classifier, we simply take the value of $y$ which maximizes $P(y|\\mathbf x)$ .\n\nThe most straightforward thing we could do is to  estimate this probability directly from the training data as follows\n\\begin{align}\n    P(y | \\mathbf x ) = \\frac{\\text{no of samples with feature vector $\\mathbf x$ and dependent variable $y$}}{\\text{no of samples with feature vector $\\mathbf x$}}\n\\end{align}\n\nIn practice, this is rarely feasible for the following reasons:\n\n* We might want to make a prediction based on a novel collection of features $\\mathbf x$ that isn't in the training data. For example, when a continuous $x_i$ takes a new value, or when $x_i$ and $x_j$ come in a pair not present in the training data.\n* Even if $\\mathbf x$ is in the training data, the numbers of such samples may be small and we might not expect the above estimate to be a good approximation to the true population value of $P(y | \\mathbf x )$\n\nThese issues are especially likely if the number of features is large or if the features may take a large number of values. In particular, if there are continuous features we will almost always be querying $\\mathbf x$'s that do not apper in the training data.\n\nThe idea behind a Naive Bayes model is to get around this by using Bayes theorem to invert the conditional probability\n\n\\begin{align}\n    P(y | \\mathbf x) = \\frac{P(\\mathbf x | y) P(\\mathbf y)}{P(x)}\n\\end{align}\n\nand then calculate the numerator using the simplifying assumption that the various features in $\\mathbf x$ are independent (conditional on $y$)\n\n\\begin{align}\n    P(\\mathbf x | y ) = P ( x_1 | y ) \\cdots P ( x_n | y ) .\n\\end{align}\n\nWe then have\n\n\\begin{align}\n\n    P(y | \\mathbf x) \\propto P ( x_1 | y ) \\cdots P ( x_n | y ) P(\\mathbf y)\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere we have thrown out an unimportant $y$ independent constant. The right hand side of this expression is less likely to have the problems mentioned above since the estimates of each factor will be based off of a larger number of samples from the training data.\n\nOne can check the independence of two continuous variables by evaluating the correlation\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\text{corr}^{(y)} (X_i,X_j) = \\frac{E^{(y)}[(X_1 - \\mu_{X_1})(X_2 - \\mu_{X_2})]}{\\sigma^{(y)}_{X_1} \\sigma^{(y)}_{X_2}}\n\\end{align}\n\nwith the training data. Here the superscripts indicate that everything is conditional on $Y=y$. This is valued in $[-1,1]$, and if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent, the correlation must be zero (though the converse does not hold). Furthermore, the correlation is  $\\pm 1$, iff $X_1$ and $X_2$ are lineraly related.\n\nLater: Correlation measures for two categorical variables and for one continuous and one categorical variable. It looks like a good discussion can be found [here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/893/how-to-get-correlation-between-two-categorical-variable-and-a-categorical-variab)\n\n### Notes:\n* Highly accurate when independence assumption is justified and if few sample probabilities near zero, but independence is a big assumption.\n* Classifier may be trained in time linear in features/samples.\n* When the estimated probability of a feature in a class is 0, must do some regularization. Even if it is very small, model is highly sensitive to these small values."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Example\n\nAs a simple example, let's use some data from the Titanic Kaggle competition, and try to use Naive Bayes to predict whether or not a passenger has survived based entirely off of what class ticket he purchased.

The dependent variable $y$ is categorical and can lie in some set $C = \\{ 1, \\dots , N \\}$. Now suppose we are given a data point with feature vectore $\\mathbf x$. The $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm classifies this data point by comparing it with samples in the training data that are closest to it in some sense. When the features are continuous, we typically use the euclidean metric to measure distance. When they are categorical, a good measure is the Hamming distance, which simply adds up how many features are different. Given $k$, the algorithm computes which $k$ training points $\\mathbf x_{j_a}$, $a = 1,...,k$ are the closest to $\\mathbf x$ in $\\mathbb R^n$ and then makes a decision as to which class the test sample lies in by taking a weighted sum\n\n$$P(y= p | \\mathbf x) = \\sum_{a=1}^k w_a I_{p}(\\mathbf x_{j_a}) .$$\n\nHere $I_{p} (\\mathbf x_j )$ is an indicator function telling whether or not a given point $\\mathbf x_j$ from the training set has $y_j = p$ and $w_a$ is a probability measure so that $\\sum_{a=1}^k w_a = 1$. This then gives a probability that the point $x_i$ has $y = p$. The classifier then returns the category with the greatest probability.\n\nThere are many different weightings one may choose. The two most common are the uniform weighting where $w_a = 1/k$ for all $a$ and the distance weighting where $w_a$ is proportial to the inverse of the euclidean distance of $\\mathbf x_{j_a}$ from $\\mathbf x$.\n\nThe distance measure is also highly customizable, for example, scaling the coordinates can make certain features more or less important. With categorical variables using the Hamming distance, we may want to weight certain features more than other. In more sophisticated applications we may want to \"learn\" the best distance measure for a model, but a good starting point is to scale all variables to have mean 0 and unit variance so the model weights them approximately euqally.\n\nOur source for details on the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#).\nWe will work through an example with continuous features and three-category classification originally found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-neighbors-plot-classification-py)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Example\n\nIn this example, we demonstrate how to use the `KNeighborsClassifier` from `sklearn` on the iris dataset provided by `sklearn`.

In the simplest case, categories are seperable by an $n-1$ plane. We then choose that $n-1$ plane such that it has the greatest distance between itself and the nearest training points of any class. This plane is called the \"maximal-margin hyperplane\" and the region bounded by parallel planes passing through the closest points is called the \"margin\". The plane is determined by the closest $n+1$ training examples, which are called the \"support vectors\". In this discussion we will focus on binary classification so that there is only one maximal-margin hyperplane. The image below is taken from `sklearn`'s discussion of support vector machines, which provides an excellent overview of the method and can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification).\n\n<img src=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_separating_hyperplane_0011.png\">\n\n\nIf the classes cannot be separated by a hyperplane, but can be to a good approximation, we still use this method, but the margin will be allowed to contain some points from the training set. The maximal-margin hyperplane is then defined by some \"cost function\", which minimized by some optimal plane. This cost function should induce a greater cost when the margin is small (we want to separate the classes as well as possible) as well as a greater cost the deeper the training set impinges on the marginal region.\n\nThe above strategy constructs a binary classifier. When building a classifier to predict more than two classes, one may use either a \"one-vs-one\" or \"ovo\" approach or a \"one-versus-rest\" or \"ovr\" approach. In the ovo approach a decision boundary is created from data for each pair of categories. In the ovr approach, a decision boundary is created comparing each category to everything that is not in that category.

For now, consider a tree $T^{(a)}$ with a given structure of nodes and branches. We can minimize its \"score\" $O^{(a)}$ by selecting weights\n\n\\begin{align}\n    w^{(a)}_b = - \\frac{G_b}{H_b + \\lambda}\n\\end{align}\n\nin which case the tree has a score\n\n\\begin{align}\n    O^{(a)} = - \\frac{G_b^2}{H_b + \\lambda} + \\gamma t^{(a)}\n\\end{align}\n\nTo actually select a good tree, we take the top-down approach discussed above in the construction of decision trees. Starting from the root, we work our way downward, trying to split a leaf into a node with two branches. We introduce a new splitting if the \"gain\" is greater than zero\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\text{Gain} &= \\text{Objective function before split} - \\text{Objective function after split}\\nonumber \\\\\n        &= \\frac 1 2 \\left( \\frac{G_L^2}{H_L + \\lambda} + \\frac{G_R^2}{H_R + \\lambda} - \\frac{(G_L + G_R)^2}{H_L + H_R + \\lambda }\\right) - \\gamma\n\\end{align}\n\nwhere $L$ and $R$ denote the left and right leaves that you get after the splitting. In the presence of many possible splittings of a leaf, we take the one with the greatest gain. Note that the effect of $\\gamma$ is to give a bias to the gain function, so that larger values of $\\gamma$ tend to prune the tree and prevent over-fitting. Similarly, larger values of $\\lambda$ decrease the positive contributions to the gain and so discourage adding new branches.\n\nApparently, XGBoost only accounts for $\\gamma$ after the tree is made, not at each step. Hence the tree is constructed as if $\\gamma$ were zero, and then one goes back and looks at all of the lowest descision nodes. If the gain is greater than $\\gamma$, that decision node is maintained, otherwise it is removed. We then proceed up the tree in this way. This is quite different from pruning at each step: we might have a split at the root node for instance whose gain does not exceed $\\gamma$, however if we never reach the root node from this bottom up proceedure, the split is maintained."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Example\n\nNow let's use `XGBoost` to produce such a model.

[This](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/add-power-to-your-model-with-adaboost-algorithm-ff3951c8de0) is also a good source. The original paper with the SAMME algorithm used by `sklearn` can be found [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/samme.pdf).\n\nLike XGBoost, AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm, that is it creates a sequence of so-called \"weak\" classifiers, this ensemble of classifiers is used to make a prediction, and then each successive classifier is chosen to correct the results of the ensemble in the best possible way. These weak classifiers may be of any type, however, they are often depth=1 decision trees, or stumps (this is the `sklearn` default). Moreover, the way in which their performance is evaluated and added to the ensemble is different. The main idea is that if the ensemble misclassifies a training example, the next tree should put more weight on that example. Hence computational time is spent focussing on learning patterns in the data that have not been learned yet (though it seems to me this would also encourage over-fitting and oversensitivity to outliers to me).\n\nNow let's give the details. Suppose we have training data $\\{(\\mathbf x_j , y_j )\\}$ where $y_j \\in \\{ 1 , - 1 \\}$ is a binary classificaton. In the first step we create a decision stump with the lowest weighted Gini index\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{| Q_L |}{|Q|} G(Q_L ) + \\frac{|Q_R|}{|Q|} G(Q_R) .\n\\end{align}\nHere $Q$ is the collection of data points in a given node\\leaf, L and R denote the two leaves in the stump, and $G$ is the Gini index of a single node. We let\n\\begin{align}\n    C_1 ( \\mathbf x) = \\alpha_1 k_1 (\\mathbf x)\n\\end{align}\nwhere $k_1$ is this decision stump and $\\alpha_1$ is a constant we show how to get later (it doesn't matter right now as this will just be an overall scale). A point is classified as $+1$ if $C_1 \\geq 0$ and $-1$ otherwise.\n\n\n\nNow suppose at the $m$th step we are given $m-1$ decision stumps $k_a$, $a=1,...,m-1$ with weights $\\alpha_a$. Importantly, the $k_a$'s are interpreted as classifiers: they return $\\pm 1$, not a probability that the result is a $+1$. Given a feature vector $\\mathbf x$, the ensemble makes a weighted vote of these classifiers\n\n\\begin{align}\n    C_{(m-1)} (\\mathbf x) = \\alpha_1 k_1 (\\mathbf x) + \\cdots + \\alpha_{m-1} k_{m-1} ( \\mathbf x )\n\\end{align}\n\nand returns the sign of $C_{(m-1)} (\\mathbf x)$.\n\n\nOur goal is to add to the ensemble an $m$th classifier $k_m$ with weight $\\alpha_m$ so that\n\n\\begin{align}\n    C_m ( \\mathbf x ) = C_{m-1} ( \\mathbf x ) + \\alpha_m k_m ( \\mathbf x ) .\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWe will discuss how to create the stump in a moment, but once we have the stump, the weight $\\alpha_m$ will be chosen to minimize some loss function, where the loss function is chosen to put greater weight on the points in the training data that were misclassified at the $(m-1)$th step. A loss function that accomplishes this is the exponential loss\n\n\\begin{align}\n    L(y_j, C_m) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_\\text{samples}} e^{- y_j C_m (\\mathbf x_j) }\n\\end{align}\n\nThe expression in the exponential is called the \"amount of say\". This is larger when $\\mathbf x_j$ is misclassified ($-y_j C_m (\\mathbf x_j)$ is positive) and indeed is sensitive to \"how badly\" it's been misclassified. Let\n\n\\begin{align}\n    w^{(m)}_j = e^{-y_j C_{m-1} ( \\mathbf x_j)} = w^{(m-1)}_j e^{-y_j \\alpha_{m-1} k_{m-1} ( \\mathbf x_j)}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThis parameterizes how badly the $(m-1)$th instance of the classifier mis-classifies the $j$th training sample. Rearranging the loss function, we have\n\n\\begin{align}\n    L(y_j, C_m) &= \\sum_{j=1}^{n_\\text{samples}} w^{(m)}_j e^{- y_j \\alpha_m k_m (\\mathbf x_j) } \\nonumber \\\\\n        &= e^{- \\alpha_m } \\sum_{j=1}^{n_\\text{samples}} w^{(m)}_j + (e^{\\alpha_m} - e^{- \\alpha_m} ) \\sum_{y_j \\neq k_m (\\mathbf x_j )} w^{(m)}_j\n\\end{align}\n\n\nLet's introduce the \"weighted error rate\" of $k_m$\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\epsilon_m = \\sum_{y_j \\neq k_m (\\mathbf x_j)} w^{(m)}_j \\big / \\sum_j w^{(m)}_j .\n\\end{align}\n\nThen given a fixed tree $k_m$, the loss function is minimized as a function of $\\alpha_m$ by\n\n\\begin{align}\n    \\alpha_m = \\frac 1 2 \\ln \\left( \\frac{1-\\epsilon_m}{\\epsilon_m} \\right) .\n\\end{align}\n\nNote that stumps with higher accuracy are given greater weight. Note that the `sklearn` implementation with the `SAMME` algorithm replaces the $1/2$ out front with a learning rate parameter $l$. This can be accomplished in the loss function by putting an overall $l$ factor in the exponential. See [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/82323/shrinkage-parameter-in-adaboost?noredirect=1&lq=1).\n\nIn choosing $\\alpha_m$, the model already gives greater weight to samples that were miscalssified by $C_{m-1}$ since each sample enters the loss function with prefactor $w^{(m)}_j = e^{- y_j C_{m-1} ( \\mathbf x_j)}$. However, apparently the SAMME algorithm used in `sklearn`'s implementation of AdABoost goes beyond this, emphasizing the misclassified data points in in training each individual classifier $k_m$ by weighting the training samples with weight $w^{(m)}_j$. This goes beyond simple gradient boosting i.e. the logic is not merely the minimization of a loss function when combining the individual classifiers. Instead, each individual classifier being used in the boosting process is itself focussing more on the samples miss-classified in the previous step.\n\n\nThe stumps are selected to so that the split has the lowest Gini index. In computing the proper split, we should give more weight to samples that $C_{m-1}$ misclassified in the following way. We could do this by calculating a weighted Gini index using the weights $w^{(m)}_j$, but apparently in the AdaBoost package, it is done by sampling from the original data set at step 0 with probabilities $\\propto w^{(m)}_j$ and creating a new sample training set of the same size, then using the unweighted Gini index.\n\nWhat we have just described is known as the SAMME algorith. `sklearn`'s implementation also allows for using the SAMME.R algoritm, which may be found described in detail [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/samme.pdf). The SAMME.R algorithm tends to converge to higher accuracy models quicker by using weak estimators that output a probability rather than simply a classification, however, we have not had time to figure out the details."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Example\n\nAgain we train the model on the Pima indians data set.
