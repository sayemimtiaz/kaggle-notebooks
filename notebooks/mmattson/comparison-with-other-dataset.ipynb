This seems reasonable, except the actual values from the WHO web page are (26.3, 24.6, 23.0).\n\nThis notebook will compare some of the features that are present in both the previous Kaggle dataset\nand the one I generated. Since I have just made this data set, and can compare directly to the data in\nthe source server, I have confidence that any differences with the previous Kaggle set are due to errors in\nthe older set (which does not document how the data was generated).\n\n[who]: https://www.who.int\n[whodb]: https://www.who.int/gho/database/en/\n[unesco_ed]: https://en.unesco.org/themes/education/databases\n[kag_ds]: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who\n[think_9_10]: https://courses.thinkful.com/dsbc-model-prep-v1/checkpoint/10"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# *** Following lines if using Kaggle ***\n\ndata_new = pd.read_csv('../input/who-national-life-expectancy/who_life_exp.csv', skipinitialspace=True)\ndata_old = pd.read_csv('../input/life-expectancy-who/Life Expectancy Data.csv', skipinitialspace=True).rename(\n    columns = {'Country':'country', 'Year':'year', 'Life expectancy ':'kag_life',\n               'Adult Mortality':'kag_adult', 'Alcohol':'kag_alcohol',\n               'BMI ':'kag_bmi', 'Polio':'kag_polio', 'Population':'kag_pop'})\n\n# *** otherwise read from local version of file ***\n#data_new = pd.read_csv('who_life_exp.csv', skipinitialspace=True)\n#data_old = pd.read_csv('Life_Expectancy_Data.csv', skipinitialspace=True).rename(\n#    columns = {'Country':'country', 'Year':'year', 'Life expectancy ':'kag_life',\n#               'Adult Mortality':'kag_adult', 'Alcohol':'kag_alcohol',\n#               'BMI ':'kag_bmi', 'Polio':'kag_polio', 'Population':'kag_pop'})\n\n# Replace two of the country names, which changed since the Kaggle set was made\ndata_old['country'] = data_old['country'].replace(['Swaziland'],'Eswatini')\ndata_old['country'] = data_old['country'].replace(['The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia'],'Republic of North Macedonia')\n\n#\n# make a new dataframe with some overlapping features\n\ndata_old2 = data_old[{'country', 'year', 'kag_life', 'kag_pop', 'kag_adult', 'kag_alcohol', 'kag_bmi', 'kag_polio'}]\n\ndata_new2 = data_new[{'country', 'year', 'life_expect', 'une_pop', 'adult_mortality', 'alcohol', 'bmi', 'polio'}]\n# the newer data has population in thousands; the older set does not\ndata_new2['population'] = 1000.0 * data_new2['une_pop']\n\n# merge tables, then remove any rows with missing values\n\ndata_new2 = data_new2.merge(data_old2, how='left')\nclean_df = data_new2.dropna(axis=0)\nprint(clean_df.info())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I have picked out 6 features which should be almost the same between the two data sets.\nI am using the country name and year to match the two sets.
