We chose to use the Specter embeddings of the tiles and abstracts as given in the most recent version of the COVID-19 project file. For all dataset records, results have been run and displayed in the order below: \n* Reading and indexing specter embeddings \n* PCA and TSNE plots displaying results for three clustering methods (Fuzzy C-means clustering, K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering)\n* The titles of the top 5 closest points to the centroids for two clustering methods (Fuzzy C-means clustering and K-means clustering) to show similarity within clusters and dissimilarity among clusters.\n\nTo efficiently run the Hierarchical clustering on the Kaggle kernel, we narrowed down the dataset to 1,000 records, and provided the code for this task. We also provided our resulting hierarchical clusters and plots for the full dataset, which we processed in the same way as demonstrated on the sample records, just at full-scale. \n\nWe have also provided some evaluation in the form of comparisons between each of the different clustering methods used, as well as some observations and next steps. As a preview, Kmeans clustering seems to be the winner in terms of clear separation between clusters."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%capture\n# create conda environment with recquired packages\n# this takes ~10-15 mins\n!conda create -n alcapone_rapids -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c conda-forge rapids scikit-fuzzy python=3.6 cudatoolkit=10.1 -y","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# this is to make the conda packages accessible\nimport sys\nsys.path = [\"/opt/conda/envs/alcapone_rapids/lib/python3.6/site-packages\"]+ sys.path\nsys.path = [\"/opt/conda/envs/alcapone_rapids/lib/python3.6\"] + sys.path\nsys.path = [\"/opt/conda/envs/alcapone_rapids/lib\"] + sys.path","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import json\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport torch\nfrom torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence\nimport skfuzzy as fuzz\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering, KMeans\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.spatial import distance as eudist\nimport glob\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nimport csv\nfrom cuml.manifold import TSNE as cTSNE\nfrom cuml import KMeans as cKMeans\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# define global variables\nROOT_PATH = '/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'\nMETADATA_PATH = f'{ROOT_PATH}/metadata.csv'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load metadata into a df and look at the contents\nmeta_df = pd.read_csv(METADATA_PATH, dtype={\n    'pubmed_id': str,\n    'Microsoft Academic Paper ID': str, \n    'doi': str\n})\nmeta_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Processing SPECTER Embeddings\n\nIn this section, we use the full data set to compare different methods of clustering (K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, Heirarchical). \n\nFor this task, we used the Specter Embeddings as described in the upcoming ACL paper found [here](https://github.com/allenai/paper-embedding-public-apis#specter). \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def create_embedding_dict(filepath, sample_size=None):\n    \"\"\"create embedding dictionary from file at given filepath\"\"\"\n\n    embedding_dict = {}\n    with open(filepath) as csvfile:\n        reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')\n        for i, row in enumerate(reader):\n            # exit the loop if the desired sample size is reached\n            if sample_size and i == sample_size:\n                break\n            embed = np.zeros((768,))\n            for idx, val in enumerate(row):\n                if idx > 0:\n                    embed[idx-1] = float(val)\n            embedding_dict[row[0]] = embed\n    return embedding_dict","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"embedding_dict = create_embedding_dict(f'{ROOT_PATH}/cord19_specter_embeddings_2020-04-10/cord19_specter_embeddings_2020-04-10.csv',\n                                       sample_size=None\n                                      )\nembedding_mat = np.array(list(embedding_dict.values()))\nembedding_mat.shape, len(embedding_dict)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Clustering \n\n## Fuzzy C-Means \nWe first chose to use Fuzzy C-means as it is an unsupervised method of dealing with a dataset that contains similarities-- it is probable that the semantics of COVID-19 paper titles and subject matter are similar enough to warrant membership in multiple clusters.

While traditional Neural IR systems focus heavily on word-level interactions, we aim to incorporate entity-oriented search into the system.  By integrating textual base IR and entity search IR, we hope that the augmented system will be able to parse harder queries with enriched data and interact with the documents in a more dynamic way.\n\nExtraction of information from a knowledge graph will have three parts.  First, by performing entity linking on the titles we aim to extract a set of important entities.  Each entity is associated with a description and type.  By creating an embedding of entities, embedding of types with attention, and embedding the description, we have a system that incorporates entity semantic relationship with augmented text data not found in the document text.  \n\nThese three embeddings are combined by a linear layer and fed to a downstream interaction matrix.  The final component of the interaction matrix will be the text data from the documents.  From there, we’ll apply an RBF kernel on the interaction matrix to generate translation scores.  \n\nThe translation scores from the query-word, document-word, query-entity and document-entity pairs will form the basis for the neural ranking model.  The neural ranking aspect can be trained by another standard ranking loss function, but for the sake of simplicity will be a pairwise loss function.\n\nThe system enables an end-to-end optimization problem.  By integrating entities, entity description, types, and text data, we will create a system that is able to learn embeddings and ranking in one go.
