The data used are survey data from two surveys released by CAMH and Delvinia. The purpose of this notebook isn't to reiterate the conclusions provided by CAMH/Delvinia (found [here](https://www.camh.ca/en/health-info/mental-health-and-covid-19/covid-19-national-survey)) but is instead intended to identify any correlations and differences across provinces among the answers to the different survey questions to better design and target mental health services in Canada. How the task criteria has been addressed is as follows:\n\n1.Scientific rigor: the data used are survey data from two surveys released by CAMH and Delvinia. For both surveys, over 1000 Canadians submitted responses.\n\n2.Scientific model/strategy: the **uncertainty coefficient** was used to quantify associations between categorical responses to survey questions. **95% confidence intervals for difference in proportions** were used to determine if there were any differences in responses between participants living in different provinces, including those with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. 95% confidence intervals for difference in proportions were used to determine if there were any differences in responses between participants living with children and participants living without children.\n\n3.Unique and novel insight: this is the first Kaggle notebook that makes use of the CAMH/Delvinia data (to the best of the author's knowledge). New information (i.e. different from what was presented by CAMH/Delvinia) is presented in this notebook - see point number 2.\n\n4.Market translation and applicability: this notebook uses a data-driven approach to determine whether certain individuals/populations among Canada should have specific mental health services/initiatives targeted towards them.\n\n7.Ability of user to collaborate and contribute to other solutions within the Kaggle community: prior to this notebook, the CAMH/Delvinia survey data was not on Kaggle.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#analysis\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport math\nimport scipy.stats as ss\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n#visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input/camhdelvinia-survey-1'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Survey 2 Results\nSurvey 1 took place from May 8-12, survey 2 took place from May 29-Jun 1.

This means we cannot estimate how nervous/anxious/on edge someone is feeling based on how their number of working hours have changed. **This means that it would be difficult to know if a mental health initiative created specifically for individuals whose working hours have changed had an influence on their feelings of nervousness/anxiety and therefore may not be worth pursuing as a mental health initiative.**\n\nThe survey responses that had the highest associations were those asking about the frequency of feelings associated with anxiety. This means that, for example, feelings of not being able to control worrying were moderately associated with having trouble relaxing. Considering that each of these particular questions were related to feelings of anxiety, it isn't surprising that there is an association between their responses. We also see small to moderate associations for the responses to the multiple questions related to depression. Associations like these likely aren't very helpful in creating targeted mental health initiatives or modifying current initiatives so they better suit individuals with needs that have arose as a result of the pandemic since the feelings of anxiety and/or depression aren't associated with any life changes that arose due to the pandemic.\n\n## Comparison of Survey Responses based on Province\nAs of June 24, the three provinces with the highest number of total cases were Quebec (>54,000 total cases), Ontario (>34,000), and Alberta (>7000).

Despite this, the responses to the survey questions and the mental health needs of people living in these provinces may differ compared to when the entire country is considered.

The associations were weak, suggesting that it would be difficult to tell if mental health initiatives specifically targeted to individuals experiencing specific life changes (for example, a reduced number of paid working hours) have any impact on their mental health. This notebook also used the survey data to determine if the feelings/needs regarding mental health varied across provinces, with consideration given to the three provinces with the most confirmed COVID-19 cases. No significant differences were found between provinces with regards to the number of most negative responses to five of the survey questions, suggesting that the offering of mental health services can be equally prioritized country-wide, regardless that some provinces have many more confirmed cases than others. There was a significant difference between participants living with children and participants living without children with regards to the proportion of most negative responses for two of the survey questions, suggesting that adults living without children may benefit from targeted mental health initiatives.\n\n\n# Limitations and Other Considerations\nA limitation of this notebook is that the survey didn't include questions about whether the participant was using/seeking mental health resources prior to the pandemic so it is difficult to evaluate how mental health challenges have shifted since the start of the pandemic; the only data we can compare to is the first round of the survey responses (not included in this notebook). Also, at the time of these surveys, aids such as CERB had already been made available to Canadians. The responses to the survey questions may have been different if the survey were released prior to when these aids were made available. It would be interesting to compare the responses between these times (pre-CERB and post-CERB, for example) and see how mental health challenges had shifted in this short time period. The survey was also not exhaustive in that no questions that could shed some light on why people were feeling depressed/anxious at the time of survey completion were included (for example, abuse in the home, not being able to physically meet with people outside of the household, etc.). However, it is acknowledged that events related to the pandemic happened very quickly and that people are more likely to complete a survey with as few questions as possible compared to a more extensive survey; given the circumstances, the results give us an idea of shifts in mental health in Canada throughout the pandemic.\n\nA final limitation is that the analysis presented in this notebook is by no means exhaustive. While I tried my best to present new information and not just repeat the summary report created by CAMH/Delvinia, there is opportunity for more analyses. Now that this dataset is in the Kaggle community, I hope more insight and investigation regarding shifts in mental health throughout the pandemic comes of this. \n\n\n# Acknowledgments\nThanks to CAMH/Delvinia for collecting the survey data and making it available to the public.
