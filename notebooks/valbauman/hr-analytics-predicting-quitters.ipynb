In the dashboard, it was realized that no standalone single variable is indicative of whether a candidate will quit after training. **Based on this, if the company wants to predict whether a person will quit after completing their training courses, a more sophisticated approach (compared to just looking at the values of certain fields) is needed. This motivates the development and validation of a machine learning model that uses only the information from the candidate that would be known prior to them being hired.** If such a model is successful, the company could use this to better predict whether a candidate will quit after completing their training courses.\n\n*Since it was already completed in the Power BI dashboard, this notebook doesn't include any exploratory data visualization. Instead, the model jumps right into necessary data transformations and machine learning model devleopment.*\n\n## Illustrated concepts\n- Ordinal encoding\n- One-hot encoding\n- Hyperparameter grid search for a machine learning model\n- Cross-validation \n\n# Imports, Data Encoding\nData cleaning steps include omitting rows that contain nan values and encoding categorical data. Ordinal encoding is used for \"gender\", \"education level\", \"enrolled university\", and \"company_size\". Categories with a mix of numerical and text values (i.e. 20 vs. \">20\") are changed to be strictly numerical with the largest value being the value included with a \">\" or \"<\" symbol (e.g. \">20\" becomes 20). For categorical variables \"major discipline\" and \"company type\", one hot encoding is used. All other variables are dropped because of either high cardinality (\"city\"), they use information that would be available only after hiring (\"training hours\"), they are the label (\"target\"), or they contain person-specific information that won't help with predictions (\"enrollee id\").

Although the performance of the models were not outstanding, this notebook provides examples on how to implement ordinal encoding, one-hot encoding, a hyperparameter grid search, and cross-validation of a model.
