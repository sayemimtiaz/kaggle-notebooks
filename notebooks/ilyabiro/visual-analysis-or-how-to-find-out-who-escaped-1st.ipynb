She departed at 19.00 carrying 989 passengers and crew, as well as vehicles, and was due to dock at 09.30 the following morning, Tragically, the Estonia never arrived.\n\nThe weather was typically stormy for the time of year but, like all the other scheduled ferries on that day, the Estonia set off as usual. At roughly 01:00 a worrying sound of screeching metal was heard, but an immediate inspection of the bow visor showed nothing untoward. The ship suddenly listed 15 minutes later and soon alarms were sounding, including the lifeboat alarm. Shortly afterwards the Estonia rolled drastically to starboard. Those who had reached the decks had a chance of survival but those who had not were doomed as the angled corridors had become death traps. A Mayday signal was sent but power failure meant the ship’s position was given imprecisely. The Estonia disappeared from the responding ships’ radar screens at about 01:50.\n\nThe Marietta arrived at the scene at 02:12 and the first helicopter at 03:05. Of the 138 people rescued alive, one died later in hospital.\n\nOf the 310 people who had reached the decks, almost a third died of hypothermia. The final death toll was shockingly high – more than 850 people.\n\nAn official inquiry found that failure of the locks on the bow visor, which broke away under the punishing waves, caused water to flood the car deck and quickly capsize the ship. The report also noted a lack of action, delay in sounding the alarm, lack of guidance from the bridge and a failure to light distress flares.\n\nThe sinking of the Estonia was Europe’s worst postwar maritime disaster.\n\nQuestions:\n1. **Who's more likely to survive the sinking based on data?**\n2. **Is age an indicator for survival?**\n3. **Is gender an indicator for survival?**\n4. **Did the crew aboard have a higher chance of survival than passengers?**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thank you artem1337 for some ideas for data visualization. \n\nLink to cernel: https://www.kaggle.com/artem1337/data-visualization","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Importing the necessary libraries.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\npd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style('dark')\nprint('Setup complete')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Below, I define a function for easy visualization of histograms.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def cust_hist(hist_obj, xlabel=None, ylabel=None, title=None):\n    _, ax = hist_obj\n    if xlabel:\n        ax.set_xlabel(xlabel)\n    if ylabel:\n        ax.set_ylabel(ylabel)\n    if title:\n        ax.set_title(title)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's read the data and look at the information about the dataset.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"path = '..//input//passenger-list-for-the-estonia-ferry-disaster//estonia-passenger-list.csv'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(path, index_col='PassengerId')\ndf.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see how many people and from which countries were present on the ship at the time of the crash.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('The number of passengers from different countries:')\nprint(df.Country.value_counts())\n\nfig, _ = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))\nax = sns.barplot(x=df['Country'].value_counts().keys(),\n            y=df['Country'].value_counts().values)\nax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=35)\nax.set_title('The number of passengers from different countries:')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Most of the passengers were divided into 3 groups: Swedes, Estonians and others.\n\nMost of the passengers were divided into 3 groups: Swedes, Estonians and others.
