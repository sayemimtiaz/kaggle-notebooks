In particular, it has the authority to ensure that appropriate standard classifications are used for this purpose. To this end, the Statistics Act 1993, 10(2), states that ’The Office (viz. Central Statistics Office) shall have authority to co-ordinate official statistics compiled by public authorities to ensure, in particular, adherence to statistical standards and the use of appropriate classifications.\n\nA classification is an ordered set of related categories used to group data according to its similarities. It consists of codes and descriptors and allows survey responses to be put into meaningful categories in order to produce useful data. A classification is a useful tool for anyone developing statistical surveys. It is a framework which both simplifies the topic being studied and makes it easy to categorise all data or responses received.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.2 Features of a classification\nIt is generally accepted that a standard classification will usually meet a number of requirements which are outlined below.\n\nExhaustive categories  - All survey responses need to fit into the classification structure somewhere\nPrecise and meaningful descriptors for categories - The content of each category in the classification should be clearly defined\nConceptually sound - The classification should have a conceptual basis and a logical structure\nStatistically balanced - In general, survey responses should not fall heavily into one category and sparsely into the other categories\nOperationally feasible - There is no point in having a classification that cannot be implemented in practice\nStatistically robust - The classification should be able to be used for a number of years without revision\nInternationally comparable - The classification should be comparable with any international standard classification","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###  <u><b>More specifically, we'll look at the following topics.</b></u>\n\n   ### <b style=\"color:blue\">1.

It’s used to test for linear relationships between data. In AP stats or elementary stats, the Pearson is likely the only one you’ll be working with. However, you may come across others, depending upon the type of data you are working with. For example, Goodman and Kruskal’s lambda coefficient is a fairly common coefficient. It can be symmetric, where you do not have to specify which variable is dependent, and asymmetric where the dependent variable is specified.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corr_matrix = heart_dataset.corr()\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))\nsns.heatmap(corr_matrix, \n            annot=True, \n            linewidths=0.5, \n            fmt= \".2f\", \n            cmap=\"YlGnBu\");","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4.
