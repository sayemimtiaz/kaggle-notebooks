The efforts made by researchers to shed light on the new Coronavirus are of crucial importance, but the huge amount of published scientific papers implies a difficult retrieval of information, making the research effort less valuable.\nIn this work we propose a tool able to provide answers to COVID-related questions retrieving information from literature, addressing precisely the problem described above.\n\nThis engine basically works in two steps: first, given a query, a subset of papers which most likely contain the answer to the proposed question is selected from the dataset. Then an answer is provided for each of the selected papers, together with additional information, through a Question Answering model.\n\nWe tested our tool on several questions, grouped in <a href=\"#Answers\">section 3</a> of the notebook together with the answers provided. To evaluate the performances of the engine proposed we defined a scoring mechanism for the answers, here reported:\n* Score 0: the answer topic is different from the question topic.\n* Score 1: the topic of the answer is correct, but the text does not answer the question.\n* Score 2: the topic is correct, but the answer is generic and not precise.\n* Score 3: the answer is consistent and precise.\n\nThe questions relative to Task 12 have been formulated and scored by specialists of the healthcare facility <a href=\"https://www.cmsantagostino.it/it\">Centro Medico Sant'Agostino</a>.\n\nThe barplot that we report aggregates the maximum scores obtained by answers relative to the 96 questions formulated and scored by us. Here we notice that 80.2% of the maximums achieve a positive score of 2 or 3.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/73JTqUa\"><img src=\"https://imgur.com/73JTqUa.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nThe second barplot that we present collects the maximum scores obtained by answers relative to the 16 questions formulated and scored by the specialists of Centro Medico Sant'Agostino. In this case 62.5% of the maximums obtains a positive score of 2 or 3.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/ItwsC1N\"><img src=\"https://imgur.com/ItwsC1N.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Description of the engine \nThis section outlines the pipeline of the tool, with a more-detailed description of each phase.\n### Preprocessing\nThe first step to perform is data preprocessing. Once imported the dataset, a preprocessing is applied exclusively to the body of each paper, as the abstracts are not used. Data are preprocessed in the following way:\n* Remove repeated observations and empty data (papers with empty body text)\n* Identify the papers published after 2019 concerning precisely the novel COVID-19 disease/SARS-CoV-2 virus\n* Remove square brackets including numbers, corresponding to citations (e.g. '\\[6, 11\\]')\n* Lowercase the text\n* Split body texts into chunks with a BERT tokenizer, each containing approximately 90 tokens (the number changes because, to avoid breaking the sentences, the paragraphs are splitted in correspondence of the closest full-stop token) \n\nOnce completed the preprocessing phase, each paper is splitted into a list of clean and lowercase chunks; this splitting is related to the embedding phase and its motivation will be clarified in the next section. Moreover, we underline that the dataset used by our engine is composed of papers concerning the SARS-CoV-2 virus exclusively (ignoring its parents SARS or MERS) since we want to provide answers precisely on COVID-19.\n### Embedding\nIn order to select a subset of papers which most likely contain the answer to the input query, an embedding-based approach is used. Given a paper, the idea is to embed all its chunks together with the query in a real-valued vector encoding the semantic meaning of the represented text, and then compute the cosine similarity between the query embedding and all the chunks embeddings. The maximum value of cosine similarity is stored, and then the process is repeated for all the papers in the dataset; the result will be a list containing the maximum cosine similarities obtained for each paper. The 5 biggest values in this list identify the papers which will serve as input for the Question Answering model described in the next section.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href=\"https://imgur.com/nUdiu8I\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nUdiu8I.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To obtain the embedding vectors we adopted a *Sentence-BERT* model. It can be described as a BERT network fine-tuned precisely to obtain semantically meaningful sentence embeddings. The impressive performances obtained by Sentence-BERT in the *Semantic Textual Similarity shared task series* led us to choose it as the best embedding model for this purpose.\nThe Sentence-BERT network that we used was able to receive as input 128 tokens at most. For this reason, we splitted the body texts of papers in chunks of 90 tokens each.\nEven if splitting the body texts leads to a computationally expensive embedding phase (due to the high number of embedding vectors to compute), it allows us to perform a fine-grained analysis of all the available data, searching at chunk-level the papers which are most semantically-correlated to the query.\n### Question Answering model\nIn the last step of the pipeline our tool provides answers to the given query, receiving as input the chuncks of the most semantically-correlated papers obtained from the embedding phase. To provide the answers, we adopted a Question-Answering model based on a BERT-large architecture, fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset.\nGiven a paper, the method provides as input to the aforementioned Question-Answering model all the chunks (one at a time) together with the query (in the usual BERT format \\[CLS\\]query\\[SEP\\]chunk_n\\[SEP\\]), obtaining the start and end tokens of the generated answer, together with its score. The engine then identifies the best answer for the considered paper as the one obtaining the highest score among all the processed chunks. This procedure is repeated for all the five papers extracted in the embedding step, and the chunks with the best scores will be displayed (one for paper), highlighting the answer. The score used to discriminate the best answer in a paper consists of the sum of the logit probabilities of the start and end tokens identified by the QA model.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href=\"https://imgur.com/tnWmTOK\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tnWmTOK.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Together with the answer, we provide additional information regarding relevance of the paper (journal SJR score and number of citations) and design of experiment.

Moreover, our tool searches for the answer in the body of papers, performing a deeper inspection with respect to solutions extracting information from abstract for example. However, the usage of deep neural networks in both the mentioned phases requires a significant computational effort, especially for the embedding step. To conclude, we attempted to stay updated with the discussions of the competition, providing as much useful information as possible such as design of experiments or journal SJR scores. \n\nThe future works that we identified to increase the quality of our engine are the following:\n* Set up an interface in order to make our tool interactive\n* Integrate a model to validate the provided answers\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left\"> This work has been conducted by the AI Team of </div>\n<img align=\"left\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SBUm1tN.png\">","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Code\nWe load the needed libraries and packages","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install semanticscholar sentence_transformers","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import base64\nimport csv\nimport glob\nimport json\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\nimport semanticscholar as sch\nimport torch\nfrom IPython.display import display, Latex, HTML\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, models\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoModel","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Preprocessing phase\nImport of data and metadata (we kindly thank MaksimEkin and his notebook 'COVID-19 Literature Clustering' for this step)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"root_path = \"/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge\"\nmetadata_path = \"{}/metadata.csv\".format(root_path)\nmeta_df = pd.read_csv(metadata_path, dtype={\n    'pubmed_id': str,\n    'Microsoft Academic Paper ID': str, \n    'doi': str\n})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"all_json = glob.glob(\"{}/**/*.json\".format(root_path), recursive=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Full bodies of the papers are provided already splitted into paragraphs (but with more than 128 tokens).
