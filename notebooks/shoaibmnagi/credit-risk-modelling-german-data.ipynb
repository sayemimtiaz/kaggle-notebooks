{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this notebook, we will use the German credit risk data from the UCI Machine Learning repository and use it to build a classifier that can efficiently identify bad loans.\n\nBefore we start, there are couple of things we should be mindful of:\n\n1. This data is quite old (from 1994), hence the amounts represented are in Deutsch Marks (not Euros).\n2. Given the fact that this data was collected a couple of years after German reunification, there is a possibility that the banks would've been operating under different conditions than they are right now. For example, in the early 1990s, Germany had a much higher [interest rate](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/mb200309_focus03.en.pdf) compared to right now. One of the reasons for this was to keep inflation under control. On the other hand, post-unification, a lot of people in the former East Germany realized the marked difference in living standards across the two halves. Hence, we can say that given the access to easy credit in a liberal democracy, German banks were receiving a lot of loan applications in the 1990s, specially from East Germans who wanted to catch up in terms of lifestyle. We can hypothesize that this would've made banks more cautionary when giving out loans. \n3. This data is quite limited. With only 1000 observations and very limited set of variables, predicting is hard. In today's day and age, credit scores (SCHUFA) in Germany are a good way od juding an applicant's credit-worthiness. However, in this dataset, we don't have access to this.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

However, the disparity between 'good' and 'bad' risk ratings when it comes to 'none' is quite astounding. Remember, these are the people who had 'NaN' in the Checking Account column in the original dataset.\n2. When it comes to saving accounts, the trend holds as well. The richer you are, the more likley you are to be classified as good. However, unlike checking accounts, where those with 'little' money have equal distribution of good and bad ratings, in savings accounts, there are visibly more good ratings than bad ones.

Boxplots of Distribution of Credit Amounts Across Several Variables\n\nObservations:\n1. We notice quite a number of interesting things when we look at the 'Credit Amount Distribution by Purpose'. Firstly, we can see that certain 'purposes' are more likely to have 'bad'ratings, specially if the loan amount is high. For example, if we look at vacation/others, we can see that 'bad' rated loans usually consist of a higher amount. Same can be observed for business loans. Generally, if we exclude furniture/equipment and repairs categories, almost all other categories have a larger interquartile range when it comes to the credit amounts of 'bad' loans. \n2. The radio/TV category has a lot of outliers, specially for loans classified as 'good'. This is quite interesting. It is hard to imagine why a person would borrow 15000 DMs from the bank just to buy a radio or a TV, let alone get his loan approved. \n3. When we look at the amount distributions according to bank account statuses, we observe that rich people tend to borrow less compared to poorer people. On one hand, this makes sense as poor people need more money to take care of their needs. On the other hand, it doesn't make sense for a relatively rich person to borrow a very small amount from the bank. \n4. When it comes to job types, skilled workers tend to have a bigger and higher IQR for bad loans than for good loans. This makes sense since larger amounts are more likely to be classified as 'bad'.
