This year marked the eighth year that they've published this Annual Developer Survey results. \n\nThis time they covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. There were a total of 129 questions on the survey and on an average, it would take a person 30-minutes to respond to the entire survey.\n\n*Despite such a great length, __over 100,000 developers__ took the survey in January 2018! That's not all though.. out of those responders, __a whopping 67,441 developers__ completed the entire survey!!*\n\nHence, this data presents a unique opportunity to learn about the trends in the opinions and the daily lifestyle of developers in 2018.  \nThis is the data that I have used for my analysis."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1f0a388db51006d3ece86f036a651382dc8e18d9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# My motivation:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"motivation\"></a>\n\nI knew very little about data visualisation (*couldn't even produce simple bar graphs if I wanted to*) and wished to learn it. And, I had recently come to the conclusion that [Kaggle is an amazing place to learn ML and Data Science concepts](https://towardsdatascience.com/use-kaggle-to-start-and-guide-your-ml-data-science-journey-f09154baba35). So, I decided to pick some interesting dataset and just dive into exploring it. \n\nI chose the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey) for the reasons mentioned above. There are some excellent public analyses present for this data already. These are my favourites:\n* [Stack Overflow 2018 survey: age, gender, sexuality](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/stack-overflow-2018-survey-age-gender-sexuality)\n* [Stack Overflow 2018 survey report](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/stack-overflow-2018-survey-report)\n\nSo, as I was exploring these kernels and trying to build my own analysis, I had this idea of introducing a new dimension to the analysis. I wanted to compare the various aspects of a developer's life based on the countries. Particularly, I wondered how the developers from my country, India, differed from the ones belonging to other countries and from the world average.\n\nGiven that India is a developing country with the world's 2nd highest population that counts Bengaluru (the software outsourcing capital of the world) as one of its major cities, I expected to find some interesting differences in my analysis. It was also encouraging to see that India is at the 2nd position based on the number of respondants to this survey:"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"09eb2bcfdf27d6907f37a0091fdcf21287ea54c2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"count = pd.DataFrame(survey_df['Country'].value_counts()[:10].copy(deep=True))\npercentage = pd.DataFrame(survey_df['Country'].value_counts(normalize=True)[:10].copy(deep=True))\n\ncount.columns = ['Count']\npercentage.columns = ['Percentage']\npercentage['Percentage'] *= 100\n\ntop_responders_countries = pd.concat([count, percentage], axis=1)\n\ntop_responders_countries.columns.name = '#Responders'\ntop_responders_countries","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"aa8531a12f2d668d2479d5aeb305cab0572cda07"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from wordcloud import WordCloud\n\ncountry = survey_df[\"Country\"].value_counts()[:100].reset_index()\nwrds = country[\"index\"].str.replace(\" \",\"\")\nwc = WordCloud(background_color='white', colormap=cm.viridis, scale=5).generate(\" \".join(wrds))\nplt.figure(figsize=(16,8))\nplt.imshow(wc, interpolation=\"bilinear\")\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.title(\"Word Cloud of countries based on the number of responders:\", fontdict={'size':22, 'weight': 'bold'});","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fab4098e0e937f7237dbd88363be1395ae0bb516"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I am new to Data Science.

I also tried to present the results of the other top 3 responding countries (viz. United States, United Kingdom and Germany) to make the comparison.\n\nHere are the important areas where Indian developers differ from the developers in the other groups:\n\n* **Low average salaries** [(link)](#general):\n    * Average salary of Indian developers is much lesser than the world average.\n    * This is despite the fact that there is a larger proportion of responders with an undergrad major in a CS-related field in India.\n    * One reason behind the lower salary might be that there is a smaller percentage of experienced and older developers in India.\n    * Rate of unemployment is much higher in India.\n    * 1 out of 3 responders from India is a full-time student.\n\n* **Youth** [(youth)](#youth):\n    * India has a __much__ younger developer population as compared to the other groups.\n    * An overwhelmingly large majority of developers have been coding (including any education) for 0-8 years\n    * A large majority of developers in India have been coding professionally for 0-5 years\n\n* **Competitive and ambitious** [(link)](#competitive) and [(link)](#ambitious):\n    * A majority of the Indian responders feel like they are competing with their peers\n    * Indian developers are very ambitious about their careers \n        * Only very few of them want to continue doing the same work\n        * A lot of them want to work in a more specialised role or as product managers\n        \n* **Appeal of Mobile development** [(link)](#mobDev):\n    * Mobile development has a unique appeal in India\n        * India has the largest number of mobile developers in the world\n        * Android and Firebase are among the top 3 most popular platforms in India, ranking even above Windows desktop or server\n    \n\n* **Opinions of Indian developers about AI differs a lot from the rest of the world** [(link)](#ai)\n* **Indians are _extremely_ interested in all new hypothetical tools** [(link)](#hypoTools)\n* **Not a lot of Indians consider ethics when writing code** [(link)](#ethics)\n* **Indians contribute to open-source but don't think they are learning from doing so** [(link)](#oss)\n* **Indian developers also differ from the other groups in their choice of communication tools, IDE and programming methodology** [(link)](#commTools), [(link)](#ide) and

India is almost 2.5 times lesser the average salary of all developers all over the world, almost 5 times lesser than the average salary in the US, almost 4 times lesser than the average salary in the

This gap is even more huge when compared to the other top 3 responding countries. Indian developers are working on significantly lower salaries than the other groups.\n\nSo, what is the reason behind this huge difference? 2 possible reasons come to mind :-\n    \n1. __Indian developers are less qualified__: \n    * One way to measure the qualification is by college degree (*I agree that it isn't a good way but a lot of the companies do use college education as a yardstick to measure a candidate's qualification*).\n    * Another way is to use a candidate's interest in programming as a proxy for his/her qualification (*Again, I know that it might not be the best possible way to measure it*). There were questions in the survey asking the responder whether he/she codes as a hobby and his/her participation in open-source culture. These might be able to indicate a candidate's interest in programming.\n    \n1. __Indian developers are working on younger developer positions__:\n\n    The younger or entry-level positions are probably paid lesser than the more experienced roles at any company.\n    \n    We have a few questions on the survey that can be used to investigate this - age of responder, years of experience with coding and years of experience with coding professionally.\n    \n*So, now I am going to use this survey's data to find out how true the above 2 statements are..*"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"983bf2e6b4bb2ab5dacdaccf1e5e1ff5d1122bc2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Education:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"education\"></a>\n**_Now, let's discuss the education of these developers.._**\n\n## Formal Education:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"formal\"></a>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0d6e513566c4f62a3f92f524f619913a6f110f36","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"formal_education_df = response_overall('FormalEducation')\nformal_education_df.columns.name = 'Highest level of formal education'\nformal_education_df.index.name = 'Country'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"655800895a8aba0f86132da10b7e6d3a4e5390c8","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"formal_education_df.sort_values(by='India', axis=1, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"0edf2bdcaeb8329475b1339ff0cb5727afac4f36"},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = formal_education_df.T.plot.barh(figsize=(12, 20))\nhandles, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()\nax.legend(handles, labels, loc='upper right');\nax.set_title(what_is(['FormalEducation'])[0].split(':')[1], fontdict={'size': 18, 'weight': 'bold'});\nax.set_xlim(0, 100);\nax.set_xlabel(\"Percentage\", fontdict={'size': 20});\nax.set_ylabel(\"Highest level of formal education\", fontdict={'size': 20});\nax.tick_params(axis='both', labelsize=18);\nax.legend(prop={'size': 16});","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8998c9c4e8e59e351194634284fcf670e937943f","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"formal_education_df.loc[:, list(reversed(formal_education_df.columns))].style.apply(highlighter, axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4ad2715772f563985de1d85fdc6ef8a8923065c0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> -

In this analysis we saw the same insights. We also saw that it is __not__ because the Indian developers don't have the necessary formal education. In fact, developers who have a traditional undergrad degree in a CS-related field are more common in India. It is also __not__ because the Indian developers are less interested in programming. \n- India had a late start in the world of computing but as we have seen in this analysis, its developers realised the potential of the last major revolution in tech - mobile apps. This makes me hopeful that we are catching up fast. Maybe, we will even play a pivotal role in defining the next major tech-revolution (*probably Artificial Intelligence*).\n- Talking about Artificial Intelligence, Indian developers are afraid of losing their jobs to it. Is that just paranoia or do they believe that they are doing a job which can be automated using some software in the future?\n   They are also more comfortable with allowing a software in the decision-making process. Is that a reflection of what they think about the current decision-makers in their company?\n- Job losses or not, in this fast-evolving tech scene, everyone needs to have a spirit self-learning. We saw in this analysis that self-education without taking any course isn't popular in India. That must change.\n- The developer community needs to make a conscious effort in on-boarding people from other disciplines. Software is getting more and more embedded in our lives each day and it is important that people from many different backgrounds are involved in building these softwares. This will especially become important as we move towards more capable AI systems so that they aren't biased.\n- Finally, it seems like India might be an important market for Stack Overflow. Indian developers use the website very frequently, they are the largest group of users of their enterprise level communication tool and are extremely interested in whatever new hypothetical tool they wish to make.\n\n*We saw in this analysis that there are very few experienced developers in India. This reflects how India missed the opportunity to play a defining role in the computing revolution that happened in the last century.

So, it would be interesting to study this.\n- **How do the opinions about AI differ?**\n    In this kernel, we saw how the Indians have much different opinions about the various aspects of advancing AI tech. It would be interesting to draw comparisons in other groups based on age, developer jobs, education, frameworks, languages, salaries, etc.\n- **What do the students think?**\n    1 out of every 5 responder to this survey is a full-time student. I think that this provides a uniques opportunity to explore what's popular among the next generation of software developers (*myself included* :D). \n- **How Vim users differ from non-Vim users?**\n    This is just because I use Vim. I love Vim. It would be fun to make something like [this excellent R vs. Python analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/nanomathias/predicting-r-vs-python).\n- **A salary predictor**\n    Stack Overflow recently launched a [salary calculator](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/salary) using this very dataset. It might be fun to try and build a similar thing.\n    \nI plan on exploring some of these questions myself but feel free to go ahead and do your own analysis if you find any of the above questions interesting.
