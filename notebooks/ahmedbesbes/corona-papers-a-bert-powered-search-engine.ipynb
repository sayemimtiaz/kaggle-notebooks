This dataset is a regularly updated resource of over 138,000 scholarly articles, including over 69,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses.\n\n\nCorona Papers also integrates additional metadata from [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/) and Scimgo [Journal](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php) to account for the online presence and academic popularity of each article. More specifically, it fetches information such as the number of shares on Facebook walls, the number of posts on Wikipedia, the number of retweets, the [H-Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) of the publishing journal, etc.\n\n\nThe goal of integrating this metadata is to consider each paper’s impact and virality among the community, both the academic and non-academic ones.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*jnnO6sc6O8f9zAT-bPhIAw.png\">\n</div>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **2 — Automatic topic extraction using a language model 🤖**\n\nCorona Papers **automatically tags each article with a relevant topic using a machine learning pipeline**.\n\nThis is done using [CovidBERT](https://huggingface.co/gsarti/covidbert-nli): a state-of-the-art language model fine-tuned on medical data. With the great power of the Hugging Face library, using this model is pretty easy.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/350/1*rr1CnqBV4_xxDH8oOZigeg.png\">\n</div>\n\n\nLet’s break down the topic detection pipeline for more clarity:\n\n- Given that abstracts represent the main content of each article, they’ll be used to discover the topics instead of the full content.<br>\n  They are first embedded using CovidBERT. This produces vectors of **768 dimensions**. <br>\n  — Note that CovidBERT **embeds each abstract as a whole** so that the resulting vector encapsulates the semantics of the full document.\n  \n\n- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed on these vectors to reduce their dimension in order to remove redundancy and speed-up later computations. **250 components** are retained to ensure 95% of the explained variance.\n\n\n- KMeans clustering is applied on top of these PCA components in order to discover topics. After many iterations on the number of clusters, **8 seemed to be the right choice**. <br>\n  — There are many ways to select the number of clusters. I personally looked at the silhouette plot of each cluster (figure below). <br>\n  ⚠️ An assumption has been made in this step: each article is assigned a unique topic, i.e. the dominant one. If you're looking at generating a mixture of topics per paper, the right way would be to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation. **The downside of this approach, however, is that it doesn’t integrate COVIDBert embeddings**.\n  \n\n- After generating the clusters, I looked into each one of them to understand the underlying sub-topics. I first tried a word-count and [TF-IDF](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/TF-IDF) scoring to select the most important keywords per cluster. **But what worked best here was extracting those keywords by performing an LDA on the documents of each cluster.** This makes sense because each cluster is itself a collection of sub-topics. <br>\n  Different coherent clusters were discovered. Here are some examples, with the corresponding keywords (the cluster names have been manually attributed on the basis of the keywords)\n  \n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pRIQIr6AApNsxy3o-R2iXw.png\">\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*HU9NDoexQ5ixGRFNio0LDQ.png\">\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pLO7_8YUW03HVJC__7WnZg.png\">\n</div>\n<br>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- I decided, finally, and for fun mainly, to represent the articles in an interactive 2D map to provide a visual interpretation of the clusters and their separability.

It was an opportunity to mix up NLP, search technologies, and web design. This was also a playground for a lot of experiments.\n\nHere are some technical and non-technical notes I first kept to myself but am now sharing with you:\n\n\n- Don’t underestimate the power of Elasticsearch. This tool offers great customizable search capabilities. Mastering it requires a great deal of effort but it’s a highly valuable skill. <br>\n  Visit the official [website](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html) to learn more.\n\n\n- Using language models such as CovidBERT provides efficient representations for text similarity tasks.\n  If you’re working on a text similarity task, look for a language model that is pretrained on a corpus that resembles yours. Otherwise, train your own language model.\n  There are lots of available models [here](https://huggingface.co/models).\n\n\n- Docker is the go-to solution for deployment. Pretty neat, clean, and efficient to orchestrate the multiple services of your app.\n  Learn more about Docker [here](https://docker-curriculum.com/).\n\n\n- Composing a UI in React is really fun and not particularly difficult, especially when you play around with libraries such as Material-UI.\n  The key is to first start by sketching your app, then design individual components separately, and finally assemble the whole thing.\n  This took me a while to grasp because I was new to React, but here are some tutorials I used:\n  \n    - React official [website](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)\n    - Material UI official [website](https://material-ui.com/) where you can find a bunch of components\n    - I also recommend this guy’s channel.
