It is just not enough to know the mean of a sample and assume that it would apply to the entire population of accidents that happen in USA. So, how confident are we on the mean of our sample. If all the conditions of accident reporting and pipeline operations remained same during the past 50 years or past 100 years, would we get the same mean time to accidents if we had sampled data from 2002 to 2009 or any other time period. The intuitive assumption is that we would not get the exact same mean every time we sampled this data.
