There are many different types of investments and investing can be dated all the way back to the 16th century. Hundreds of years later a strategy of investment emerged  in 18th century France: the idea of pooling assets together from various sources with the intent of collectively investing. \n\nThese investment funds first emerged in the United States in the form of __Mutual Funds__, funds that are actively managed by a fund manager who uses the assets within the fund to generate returns for the fund shareholders. Because these funds need management in order to generate returns, there is a fee involved in joining them. The fund investment vehicle that later emerged to challenge Mutual Funds are __Exchange Traded Funds or ETFs__. In direct contrast with Mutual Funds, ETFs are passively managed -- they track a specific market index. With ETFs, investors hope to capture the returns of the market on the whole, and not waste the resources required to actively manage a fund.       \n\nThe question of whether the active management style of Mutual Funds can outperform the market and the passive investment style of ETFs has been debated by investors and the answer still remains unclear. In our project we identified the aspects of each fund that are most correlated with fund returns for each type of fund. We then went through our dataset to determine which funds had above average returns and attempted to predict above average returns or not based on each fund's most correlated variables. In the end we found that ETFs have extremely high predictive accuracy based on the fund descriptors that would be available to investors at the time of investing and Mutual Funds have poor predictive accuracy when trying to predict if a Mutual Fund will have above average returns. \n   \nOn top of this predictive analysis, we analyzed the investment types of each fund and how that affected fund return. Growth funds have extremely high returns in short time frames, and growth ETFs are significantly better than growth Mutual Funds. Value funds emerge with high total returns in a very long investing period, and once again we found value ETFs were superior to value Mutual Funds.\n\nThese key insights gained lead us to the conclusion that the active management style of Mutual Funds proves to be inferior to the passive management of ETFs. ETFs dominate Mutual Funds in all investment types and across all time frames, as well as having extremely high predictive accuracy with fund descriptors. Mutual Funds are more unpredictable and have more factors attributing to their success, causing them to be hard to predict and not nearly as reliable as Mutual Funds. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### __Research Question:__\n\nWhat set of criteria is most important to the sucess of a mutual fund?

Each of the datasets are composed of publicly available information and were not funded by any companies or private organizations. The instances in each of the datasets are  funds with the respective fund type, either Exchange traded funds in the ETF.csv or Mutual funds in the Mutual Funds.csv. The columns in each of the datasets contain information on the respective fund's financial ratios, sector investments, risk ratios, and returns. The data in each of the datasets was collected over a time period between 2011 and 2020. The original datasets don't have any errors but they do contain null information in the form of empty columns that were dropped during our data cleaning. This preprocessing and all other preprocessing of the data found in the two datasets is extensively documented in our data cleaning section and we have made no additional modifications or alterations to the data.

These values in columns were useless and in most cases would give us a problem when calculating our analysis, for you cannot use most of our functions with ‘Nan’ as the input when it is expecting something like a number. To solve this problem, we dropped ‘Nan’ values or empty values. When we went through the columns to find these values and drop them, every single value in the same row of this ‘NaN’ value that was dropped would be dropped as well for every column. These values in the other rows that were dropped because of the ‘Nan’ value were actually pieces of data that we could have used. Unfortunately, they had to be dropped because of this ‘Nan’ value. This happened relatively frequently because the dataset had a lot of these ‘Nan’ values, so we lost a decent amount of data as a result of dropping these values. That is one limitation that we had to combat during our analysis. \n\nAnother data limitation that we encountered during this project was that the Mutual Fund Data set was more complete than the ETF dataset. What this means is that the Mutual Fund data set was not only bigger than the ETF dataset, but it had values that the ETF data set did not have. Since the ETF dataset did not have some of the values that the Mutual Fund data set had, we could not compare these values between the two data sets. This limited us to exploring certain areas of Mutual Funds and then comparing them because we would have nothing to compare it to. Some of these variables were very interesting, but unfortunately we were not able to compare the two. \n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# __Loading Data__\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_mf= pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/mutual-funds-and-etfs/Mutual Funds.csv')\ndf_etf=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/mutual-funds-and-etfs/ETFs.csv')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## __Preliminary Data Cleaning__","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"__The first step of the preliminary data cleaning is to drop all of the null columns and all of the unused columns from our DataFrames__","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"empty_cols2 = [col for col in df_etf.columns if df_etf[col].isnull().all()]\ndf_etf.drop(empty_cols2,axis=1,inplace=True)\n\nthrowaway_cols=[\n    'quarters_up',\n    'quarters_down',\n    'top10_holdings',\n    'years_up',\n    'years_down',\n    'currency'\n]\ndf_mf.drop(columns=throwaway_cols,axis=1,inplace=True)\ndf_etf.drop(columns=throwaway_cols[2:],axis=1,inplace=True)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"__The second step of the Preliminary Data Cleaning section is creating a cleanbykeyword method.

The overall premise of this idea is to create a method or predictor variable that predicts the success of a fund. To do this, we will analyze the variables of the funds that we have in our data set to see which variables are most closely correlated with the success of a fund. After finding which variables are most closely correlated with the success of a fund, we will define a model that uses these variables to predict fund returns in given time periods. This will provide us with a deeper understanding of which factors most greatly influence fund performance and which variables have little effect on fund performance. By exploring the correlations between variables and fund success, we will further discover the intricacy of what makes a fund successful or unsuccessful. We will perform a factor analysis of sorts for each of the two fund types -- ETFs and Mutual funds -- and compare the relationships between variables that make that specific fund type successful. We aim to distinguish the success of funds in different time frames, short term,medium term, and long term, as they may have differing contributing variables. __The point of this analysis is to make a finding about the distinguishing characteristics of successful ETFs and Mutual funds -- and what makes these respective fund types successful in the long and short term.__ \n2. Our second idea focuses more on the binary characteristics of funds. An example variable in our data set we could use for a binary analysis is where a fund is above a certain success rate - by differentiating funds into 2 categories , one where the fund is above average (however we determine this average) or below average. __The point of this analysis is to find connections between fund success but on a more broad level using binary values. This would give us a broader basis of comparison for each of the funds, since we already will have a more narrow basis of comparison from Analysis 1.__ We could also use this type of analysis to determine which individual size type is most closely correlated with fund success (Ex: size is large or not large, size is small or not small). Alternatively, we could try to predict the fund success based on fund type. We could have the success of a fund be represented as a binary value-- where we are determining the basis for success. Analysis of binary variables can be quite useful in determining the direct relationship between the presence of a certain variable and fund success because the external influences are limited. Thinking in terms of binary characteristics is a very effective way to analyse different aspects of something. It helps when you want to stay broad and not have too many categories, and this is what we want to do with this analysis. Our first analysis was looking into more specific variables, where this one takes a broader approach to looking at the fund in the bigger picture and a little more simply by using binary characteristics.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# __Analysis of Sectors of Investment:__","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cols=[i for i in df_mf_sector.columns[1:11]]\nplt.title('ETF Sector Distrubution')\npercent_comp_bar(df_etf_sector,cols,'sector_')\nplt.title('Mutual Fund Sector Distrubution')\npercent_comp_bar(df_mf_sector,cols,'sector_')\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nAs we can see from the pie charts, the average sector holdings between both Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds are very similar.

We realized though that this was because the variables are nearly identical in what they fundamentally are—they are both measures of fund return--, so it makes sense that their correlation was so high. With this In mind, we knew that going forward, it would not be useful to us in our calculations to use the fund_mean_annual_return to predict fund return because you are essentially using fund return to predict itself. When comparing ETFs and Mutual Funds, it seems that the Treynor and Sharpe ratios are more highly correlated with ETFs than Mutual Funds, while both still have a relatively high correlation with fund return. We found that as we increase the time frame, the predictive accuracy of our model decreases for Mutual Funds, but not for ETFs. This pattern was shown through comparing the different colors of bar graphs within each variable. Each color represents a different time period, so the fact that the bar graphs are decreasing (for Mutual Funds) as the time period is increasing shows that as time goes on, our predictive accuracy goes down. The alpha value has a very clear drop off, starting at approximately a .6 correlation in the short term and then dropping down to approximately .1 correlation in the long term. \n\nThe overall conclusions that we have formulated from this analysis is that we are no longer going to proceed doing calculations with the fund_mean_annual_return as a predictor variable for fund return due to how similar the variables are.

The conclusion that we came to after performing our time frame analysis on the fund returns and predictor variables was that ETFs are more easily predictable than the Mutual Funds are. The results of these chi-squared tests show that our predictor variables for ETFs predicting the success of a fund are all significant, while our predictor variables for Mutual Funds are not significant. This goes along with our previous conclusion and analysis that ETFs are far more predictable than Mutual Funds are. What we can gather from these results is that there are ways in which you can calculate the predictability of ETFs, which could make for a more sound investment over Mutual Funds. With the ability to predict the success, you have a good idea of how your money is being spent, and a general idea that you are making a good investment. On the other hand, with Mutual Funds, there is far less predictability when making an investment, so you are not as sure if your money will be well spent. When we formulated a predictor model in our analysis, the prediction accuracy for ETFs was at 86.98%, which is very high. This predictability is far greater than the Mutual Fund predictability, which was 65.90%. The way we calculated predictability was by determining whether or not a fund was above average, so there were two different outcomes. If you were to randomly guess if a fund was above average or not, your probability for making a sound investment would be 50%. Our prediction accuracy for Mutual Funds is only 65.90%, which is not much greater than if you were to simply guess. The ETF model is significantly greater than 50%, showing a significant difference when you predict a fund rather than simply guessing. These results go hand and hand with the results of the significance test. The fact that the Mutual Fund predictor variable is not significant coincides with the fact that we have a low prediction accuracy for Mutual Funds. The fact the ETF predictor variable is significant coincides with the fact that we have a high prediction accuracy for ETFs.

We went through this analysis looking to compare ETFs to Mutual Funds—trying to see areas with notable similarities or differences. We used graphs to help visualize these comparisons and see which areas sparked our interest for deeper analysis. After exploring our data on a more basic level, we took it to the next level through our first analysis.\n \nWe started to analyze our data in depth first through the sector distributions within Mutual Funds and ETFs. We learned from these visualizations that sector investment has a generally weak and positive correlation with fund returns. The strongest correlation that we found only went up to a value of .3, which was still an overall small correlation, giving us little information. The area in which we found notable differences was the energy sector of ETFs and Mutual Funds. The ETF energy sector showed a weak correlation to the fund return, but the Mutual Fund energy sector showed no correlation at all. We made note that Mutual Funds invested more in technology, health care, and communication sectors while ETFs invested more in the basic materials sector. It came out to be that investment in any sector—except for technology—had essentially no correlation with the fund return. We came to the conclusion that there was no substantial evidence to say that the overall differences in fund return between Mutual Funds and ETFs could be attributed to a difference in investment sectors. This section helped us to make new conclusions about energy stocks overall, and how certain investors could look at Mutual Funds vs ETFs. Investors who are more interested in the energy sector and are looking to have this aspect of their portfolio should look to invest in ETFs instead of Mutual Funds. It seems that an investment in the energy sector of a Mutual Fund would generate no returns, which could be attributed to a variety of differences in the structure of Mutual Funds. Mutual Funds are more actively run, while ETFs are more passively run. The Mutual Funds have used their active management to pick poor investments in the energy sector over the last decade. This could be due to the fact the overwhelming success of energy stocks—Tesla, for example— has been downplayed and heavily shorted by fund managers, which would mean that companies are less inclined to choose to invest. This is a potential explanation as to why Mutual Funds don’t seem to generate as high returns from the energy sector as ETFs do.\n \nIn our next area of analysis, we were aiming to gain more information about the correlations that each of the different variables have with the ytd fund return. Once we generated these coefficients, we used them to create a composite variable. This score variable is composed of waded values for each of the variables based on their correlation coefficient. We then checked the accuracy of this variable using logistic regression for both Mutual Fund and ETFs to see if it accurately assessed whether or not a fund had above average fund returns. Within this logistic regression function, we also calculated the accuracy of our model, as well as the r-squared coefficient. Our findings show that ETFs tend to be a little more predictable in a one-year time period than Mutual Funds are. We suspect that this is because Mutual Funds employ an active management strategy, where ETFs simply follow an index and blindly proceed. After this analysis, we next analyzed how the predictive accuracy of ETFs and Mutual Funds varies across different time frames.\n \nWe aimed to examine a different aspect of funds based on the different time frames: investment strategy. We wanted to now look at the different investment strategies of Mutual Funds and ETFs across different time frames and see how the returns differ over different time frames. Once we plotted these graphs, the returns based on investment strategies were very apparent in the graphs. Based on these graphs, we concluded that for an investor who was looking to hold their fund position for a short period of time—less than one year-- , it is strongly recommended that they invest in growth ETF Funds. For the next time frame – 1 to 5 years—our graph shows that a growth ETF fund would still be the wise decision for a sound investment. After these time periods, once we got to 5 to 10 years, all of the graphs started to converge. For the long term, we found that the ETF value fund is the fund option with the highest return, but this was not as obvious as the shorter time periods. With the shorter time periods, there was a much bigger difference between the fund returns between each investment strategy, but as time went on, the fund returns started to converge for each strategy.\n \nFor our final analysis, we were looking to further analyze the difference between Mutual Funds and ETFs in the different time periods. This analysis took the predictor variable component that we performed and combined that with the time frame analysis concept that we also discovered in our analysis. Each of the variables that we have in our dataset have specific values for the different time periods, so we split them all up into their respective time periods and made three different predictor variables for each time period. Each of these scores waded the variable with the correlation to fund return to predict the success of a fund with a score. We then used a logistic regression to fit this model to find each of the prediction accuracies for the time periods of both Mutual Funds and ETFs. Overall, the ETFs were far more predictable, with prediction accuracies significantly higher than Mutual Funds. The prediction accuracies for Mutual Funds were very low, and not much more accurate than if you were to simply guess the success of a fund. To statistically prove whether these variables were statistically significant, we went through each of the six variables and ran a chi-squared test of independence to see if there truly was a relationship between these variables and the success of a fund—which we measure in terms of fund return. When we ran these tests, we got results that were not surprising to us. All of the ETF predictor variables for all of the time frames proved to be statistically significant on a 95% confidence interval, while the majority of the Mutual Fund variables proved not to be significant on the same 95% confidence interval. This coincides with what we have analyzed this entire time in the project by proving that ETFs are more predictable that Mutual Funds are. We specified the areas where ETFs were stronger than Mutual Funds throughout the project. Overall, more of the areas of this analysis gave us significant reason that we should invest in ETFs over mutual funds in certain situations. This analysis gave us very deep and thorough insight on the activities of ETFs and Mutual Funds, and the two compared to one another. These insights lead us to the conclusion that ETFs were a superior investment to Mutual Funds. The incredible predictability of ETFs gives them a large advantage over Mutual Funds, and the significant superiority of ETFs amongst growth funds and value funds makes them the clear better investment.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## *Data Description Continued:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### __MOTIVATION__\n\n__Why was this dataset created?__\n- These datasets were created to allow for multiple comparisons regarding portfolio decisions from investment managers in Mutual Funds and portfolio restrictions to the indexes in ETFs.

The fact that this is a public site might have influenced what data was observed and recorded because it is data that is readily available, as opposed to medical data which is harder to obtain/is usually private. Furthermore, the which data was observed or collected was possibly influenced by its ability to allow comparisons regarding portfolio decisions. Lastly, data was collected on specific financial instruments like ETFs and mutual funds, so data on another financial instrument like municipal bonds would’ve been ignored.\n\n__Over what time frame was the data collected?__\n- The timeframe of the data contains stock returns up to date to November of 2020. The data provides a stronger answer to the broader question of ETF success now.\n\n__How was the data associated with each instance acquired?__\n- The data was directly observable- rates, prices, text, etc. This data was scraped from Morningstar through Yahoo Finance.

We broke up the ETF dataset into separate dataframes to make it easier to work with. For example, we made a dataframe just for the standard deviations of the funds. We also made a dataframe just for different fund ratios, such as the price earnings ratio and the price book ratio. We cleaned by key words in order to make each individual dataframe have a purpose. We dropped empty columns/values as well.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n","metadata":{}}]}
