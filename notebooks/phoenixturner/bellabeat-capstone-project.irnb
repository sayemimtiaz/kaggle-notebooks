I realized that after starting with a RMarkdown file that I am not able to easily upload it here on Kaggle without going through additional work to recreate it. However, the analysis is posted on Rpub by RStudio. To view please check out the link below.\n\nLink: https://rpubs.com/phoenixdt/810881\n\nMain reason I am posting this in the \"CODE\" section is to simply share my analysis in the hopes it may help anyone who is also new. Also, if there is any feedback to make the analysis better or to do things better/easier in R... all feedback would be appreciated. \n\nThank you for your time,\nPT\n","metadata":{}}]}
