Efficiency of context classification with $5$ clusters is $0.78$.\n2. A lower number of clusters seems to improve efficiency, but it may affect relevance of returned results. Relevance has been evaluated qualitatively only.\n3. We have observed that the answer to a specific query using the Task's keywords is often found explicitely (or implied) in the results. See below a couple of examples:\n\n   - Query: Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans\n     - Answer: the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 5.2 days.\n   - Query: how long individuals are contagious?\n     - Answer: sars-cov-2 is contagious even in the incubation (sars was not)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pros and Cons\n\n### Pros\n1. Simple and completly automatic approach combining unsupervised and supervised techniques.\n2. The system returns detailed information (not complete articles) about a topic or keyword. \n3. The system allows queries using natural language.\n4. Low computation cost\n5. No feature engineering\n6. Highly interpretable features\n7. Can be easily adapted to the other tasks in this challenge with different questions.\n8. The system does not require external resources besides the dataset.\n9. The number of results to show can be define as desired.\n\n### Cons\n1. No query reformulation implemented.\n2. No metadata included in the results (i.e., source of the information, year, etc.).\n3. The number of clusters has to be defined manually.\n4. Relevant information may have been left out during filtering of contexts.\n5. No keyword stemming or lemmatization\n6.
