There are several reasons these datapoints can appear in datasets. They can either represent unusual observations or errors in data-entry (Bose, n.d.). Either way, they can greatly affect the accuracy of a machine learning model or statistical analysis in general. As such, during data preprocessing, one of the objectives is to detect the outliers in the dataset; however, despite the potential negative effects on future analysis, removing all of the identified outliers is the wrong choice. Outliers can serve as helpful indicators to possible trends that the analyst may have overlooked or point to exceptions that can be quite important for the scientist's model. We should aim to remove only outliers, which are clearly data-entry errors or extremely unrealistic, since those are not helpful to the analysis whatsoever (Widmann, Heine and Silipo, n.d.). \n\nOutlier detection can prove challenging, because every dataset has different data and different data distributions; thus, it is essential to know a variety of outlier detection techniques. In this notebook, we will focus on four techniques: the numeric outlier technique, Cook's Distance, Mahalanobis Distance, and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. These four methods are quite different from each other, and should provide us with a good toolset to detect outliers in a variety of datasets. Note that all of these methods are non-parametric techniques of outlier detection, since we cannot always make assumptions about the distribution of the data.\n\nFor this notebook, I will use the [Brazilian Houses To Rent](https://www.kaggle.com/dataset/0fc2c2957155f98e380a0e5e7db219aff29962b37b13e6ac5a569389cfe26e83/version/1) dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset is perfect for this notebook, since it contains data-entry errors, while also containing observations which are most-likely accurate, but are unusual for the dataset. \n\nIn order to understand how effective each of the methods are, we will take a closer look at the observations that were identified as outliers and gain insight from those observations. Additionally, we will also optimize some of the techniques to gain a deeper understanding of how to use the methods and how effective they are in detecting outliers. Finally, after applying a technique to the dataset, we will also weigh its pros and cons and reach a conclusion about the outlier detection method.  \n\nLet's start by importing all of the necessary libraries and taking a quick look at the dataset...","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import mahalanobis\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2\nfrom sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.3035Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.304021Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.310142Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.303989Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.308862Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading the dataset and assigning its length to a variable\nhouses = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/brasilian-houses-to-rent/houses_to_rent_v2.csv\")\noriginal_length = len(houses)\nhouses.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.319281Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.319627Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.367995Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.319597Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.367065Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The floor column has some non-numerical values ('-'), these will be replaced by 0, since I am assuming that '-' indicates a single-story house and \n# does not indicate missing data\nhouses.replace({\"-\": 0}, inplace=True)\nhouses[\"floor\"] = houses[\"floor\"].astype(int)\n# Apart from this, there is no other potentially missing data in the dataset\n\n# Only selecting numeric columns\nhouses = houses.select_dtypes(include=np.number)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.369597Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.37013Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.388966Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.370087Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-19T21:10:23.387736Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Numeric Outlier Technique\nThe Numeric Outlier Technique will be arguably the simplest method within this notebook. For this non-parametric method, we need to calculate the first and third quartiles, as well as the interquartile range (IQR). We then calculate the upper and lower 'bounds' of the dataset. The upper bound is calculated by adding the IQR multipled typically by 1.5 to the third quartile. Similarly, the lower bound is calculated by subtracting the IQR multipled by 1.5 from the first quartile. Any point that lies below or above the lower bound and the upper bound respectively is considered an outlier. By having the IQR multiplier be 1.5, the upper and lower bounds will correspond to the upper and lower whiskers in a boxplot.

Firstly, as evident by the maximum metrics, we have removed observations with (most-likely) data-entry errors, such as the observations in the area or floor column. However, the minimum metrics perfectly show why the interquartile range multiplier was too low. Some of the values which were removed from the rooms or floor columns are realistically too low to be considered data-entry errors or even valid outliers in the real world. Interestingly, the column with the most outliers was the property tax column. It is not immediately clear why that is, because, logically, this column should correlate with the rent amount (R$) column. Perhaps, the property tax in Brazil is progressive, making the tax for more expensive apartments much higher than for low-cost housing. \n\nAs shown by the summary table, the IQR multiplier is clearly too low to properly identify outliers. We should increase the upper bound by increasing the IQR multiplier. This will allow us to detect more 'unrealstic' observations. However, it is not immediately clear what that multiplier should be. Thus, we will steadily increase the multiplier until we have identified one percent of the dataset as outliers. The reason why I have chosen one percent is because this small value will identify observations which are the most further from 'normal' data, making them outliers.

This suggests that there is a large cluster of observations grouped together, which are 'located' beyond the traditional whiskers of the boxplot. In turn, this discovery allows us to identify those points as non-outliers, since points within a larger group or cluster cannot be really considered as outliers. Instead, it is most-likely a group of high-class houses, and not anomalies. Then, the level-off suggests that those clusters are reducing in size. This suggests that high-class houses are not as popular in the Brazilian rent market as middle-class apartments are, which realistically makes sense.

Most observations identified as outliers were detected in the propert tax column. This reinforces the idea from above that the property tax in Brazil is possibly quite progressive. This argument is further supported by the standard deviation for the column. Additionally, we still managed to catch the observations with clear data-error entries, as evident by the maximum row for the area, floor, and total columns. However, some observations can still cause confusion. For instance, the minimum value for property tax, is realistically not too high, which could suggest it is a real observation. This shows that perhaps it is better to increase the IQR mutliplier separately for each column. This, however, will require more time and processing power. Furthermore, it is not immediately clear what value the IQR mutlitplier should be for each column and how to determine that value. This also forces us to question and choose how many observations we want to be identified as outliers for every column; this is a question that does not have a clear answer or even a clear method to obtain the answer. \n\n### Numeric Outlier Technique Conclusion\n\nThe Numeric Outlier technique is an incredibly simple method for identifying outliers in a dataset. It is cheap in terms of processing power and does not require too much coding. Its simplicity is great for medium-sized datasets with focused distributions and observations. Additionally, due to its one-dimensional nature, it is great for datasets with a small number of features or columns that are not necessarily related to each other.\n\nThe simplicity, however, also causes certain problems. For instance, as we saw with our dataset, we have identified approximately 20% of our dataset to be outliers using the standard IQR multiplier. This led us to modfying the multiplier until less than one percent of the dataset was identified as outliers, requiring more code and making the method less intuitive. It also means that in order to obtain optimal results, you will most likely need to tweak the IQR multiplier for different datasets. The disadvantage is especially clear if you are going to modify the IQR multiplier for each column individually, which may be required with certain datasets or columns. Given the unpredictability of real-life data, this makes the technique unsuitable for immediate use for most datasets out there. Its biggest weakness, however, is that it does not consider the relationships between the columns, which can prove quite important, especially without contextual knowledge about the dataset. For example, consider a house whose area is 50 square meters, but which has 4 bathrooms according to your data. In the context of their individual columns, the two figures make sense; however, together, they become an anomaly and a possible data-entry error, since it is unlikely a house with a relatively small area has that many bathrooms. This is where multivariate outlier detection comes in. \n\nIn particular, this is where Mahalanobis Distance can be incredibly useful to detect outliers in the dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Mahalanobis Distance \nMahalanobis Distance is a distance metric, which finds the distance between a point and its distribution. It uses the inverse of a covariance matrix of variables in the combination with the data's center to find the distance, which means that it detects outliers based on the pattern of data points (Cansiz, 2020). Since this method can find distances in multidimensional spaces, it is great as a multivariate outlier detection technique.

For instance, in observation 9822, the amount of parking spaces provided seems to be too high for the given area and amount of rooms. It is somewhat difficult to determine whether this is a factual observation or a data-entry error, since I have no knowledge about the Brazilian real estate markets; however, if we look at other observations in the table, the amount of parking spaces provided seems to be more appropriate for the amount of rooms in the apartment. Still, though, it is important to look at other datapoints with similar values in order to remove such observations. Additionally, Mahalanobis Distance has identified the observations containing what look like data-entry errors, such as observation 255, which can be confidently removed. There are, however, observations, which we cannot confidently call data-entry errors or even outliers, such as observations 6731 or 1467. Such observations will require further investigation and analysis in order to determine whether they should be removed from the dataset. It could be worth also using other multivariate outlier detection techniques and see if the same observations are identified as outliers.\n\n### Mahalanobis's Distance Conclusion\nMahalanobis Distance is a useful outlier detection technique. One of its strengths is that it works well with multivariate data, which is what we encounter most in the real world. This allows you to detect outliers without much of the contextual knowledge of the dataset, as we have seen previously with the Brazilian houses dataset. It is also quick to implement and does not require much coding, especially if you use the scipy function. Most importantly, though, unlike Euclidean Distance, it considers the distribution of the data and accounts for the variance of said data, which makes it a great alternative to Euclidean Distance, which can often incorrectly identify outliers. Finally, due to its nature, it is well optimized right away and requires very little tuning; the most that a user has to do is to determine the cut-off using the Chi-square distribution. Due to its multivariate nature, however, it becomes hard to visualize this method, making it less intuitive. It is possible to see the interaction of two different columns in a two-dimensional graph, but visualization gets quite difficult or even impossible past that point. In turn, this leads to another disadvantage: it can be hard to know exactly why an observation was identified as an outlier. This makes the decision of whether to remove an observation even harder, since you may not possess all of the necessary information. This creates a need for a metric which is intuitive, no matter the dimensions or the size of the dataset. To get this metric, we are going to look at Cook's Distance, another outlier detection technique.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Cook's Distance\nCook's Distance is used as an estimate of a data point's influence when conducting least-squares regression analysis. The intuition behind Cook's Distance is that the more influential a point is relative to other points during regression analysis, the more likely it is to be an outlier, which negatively affects the performance of the model (Pineda, 2020). The formula to calculate a point's Cook's Distance i.e influence is: \n\n$$D_i = (r_i^2 / p*MSE) * (h_{ii} / (1-h_{ii})^2)$$\n\nwhere:\n- $r_i$ is the i<sup>th</sup> residual\n- $p$ is the number of coefficients in the regression model\n- $MSE$ is the mean squared error\n- $h_{ii}$ is the i<sup>th</sup> leverage value\n\n(How to Identify Influential Data Points Using Cook's Distance - Statology, 2019)\n\nOnce we find each observation's influence, we also have to set a threshold, which will determine whether a datapoint's influence is too high or not. Traditionally, 4/n is used as a threshold, where n is the number of observations (How to Identify Influential Data Points Using Cook's Distance - Statology, 2019)\n. We will stick with this.\n\n\nAlthough the formula is quite complicated, we will not have to apply it directly. We are going to use the statsmodel package, which will provide us with Cook's Distance for each observation when we train a linear regression model. Our target will be the total rent column, while all of the other numeric columns will be the featues.

This shows how essential it is to analyze the potential outliers in more detail, instead of just removing them right away.\n\n### Cook's Distance Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen, Cook's Distance works well with linear regression. It allows us to know how influential each point is during analysis, making Cook's Distance much more intuitive and simple when compared to Mahalanobis Distance. Similar to Mahalanobis Distance, though, it is great for working with multivariate data and can often provide interesting insights into the data. It is important to note, however, that Cook's Distance works best only if there's a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. Otherwise, Cook's Distance may not work as well as intended. Perhaps, in case that only a few features have a linear relationship with the target variable, it is best to isolate those features and use Cook's Distance to identify outliers only within those columns. \n\nIn today's notebook, we have mostly looked at statistical measurements to find outliers; however, we have not looked at machine learning algorithms in order to detect anomalies within the data.

It has also identified observations, where it is not immediately clear why they are outliers, such as observation 9706; however, given that DBSCAN works based on Euclidean Distance, we are aware that this outlier is incredibly far from all of the other datapoints. Unfortunately, it is impossible to find out how far it is exactly using DBSCAN, so the best thing to do would be to look at similar observations and calculate the distance yourself, which may take time. Additionally, you will probably have to calculate the Euclidean Distance for each of the observations then, since you will need to compare how far your outlier is from the non-outlier data. This can take quite a bit of processing power, especially when working with large datasets.\n\n### DBSCAN Conclusion\nDBSCAN is a clustering algorithm, which, in addition to classifying the data, can also identify outliers. It is incredibly intuitive and easy to implement. It also works well with multivariate data and, as we saw, can effectively determine anomalies within the data. However, it also has a range of cons. The method can be quite difficult to optimize for a particular dataset, as we saw earlier. Finding appropriate epsilon and minimum samples values can take a lot of time and processing power. Additionally, unlike with Mahalanobis Distance or Cook's Distance, we can't determine how far the outlier is from other observations, without doing extra coding and allocating a lot of processing power. This metric could have been incredibly useful when deciding whether to keep the 'outlier' in the dataset or not. Finally, as mentioned previously, Euclidean Distance, which is used by the DBSCAN, can be quite problematic, since it does not consider the pattern that the data follows, leading to possibly inaccurate results when working with certain datasets. Perhaps, this is why the optimal epsilon value for our data was so high. Fortunately, this problem can be solved, since sklearn's implementation of DBSCAN allows you to set your own callable as a parameter, but this will also require extra work and optimization to work well. Thus, DBSCAN can be used effectively, but it does require a lot of preparation to do so, making it not the most efficient method out there.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Conclusion\n\nIn this notebook, we have looked at four techniques of outlier detection, which is an important phase of data preprocessing. Since each technique is quite different from one another and each one has its own pros and cons techniques are quite different from each other, they can be used when working with different datasets or even models. They can also be certainly used together, since they can identify different observations as outliers or provide more confidence that a certain record is an outlier when working with data. Finally, outlier detection and these techniques can often lead to more interesting information about the dataset. For instance, during this notebook, I've realized that due to the wide range of housing that is present in this dataset, a single model will not work efficiently for all of these types. Perhaps, it is best to train a clustering algorithm which will split the data into 3-5 categories and have another model for each category. This idea will be tested in my next notebook.\n\nThank you for reading this.
