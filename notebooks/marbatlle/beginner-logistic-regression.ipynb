Data Description"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Heart diseases are responsible for millions of deaths each year in the world. In fact, health problems associated with the heart have become the leading cause of death in recent years. Every year more people die from heart disease than from any other cause. To be more specific, it is estimated that in 2012, 17.5 million people died from this cause.\n\nThese illnesses can cause severe problems in patients, including death, with virtually no signs of showing until the patient has significant symptoms. As a result, it is very important to detect the disease early to facilitate its treatment, which is why the study of the different predictive indicators of the probability of contracting heart disease is of great interest. The prediction of heart disease is considered one of the most important topics in clinical analysis, due to this great importance, we have chosen a dataset that studies this topic.\n\nWe will be working with the Kaggle Heart Disease ICU dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). The original source can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset shows a set of real data, created by researchers from the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland and V.A. Medical Center.\n\nThe set of variables that the file has is:\n\n**id:** patient identification number \n<br>**age:** age in years\n<br>**sex:**(1 = male; 0 = female)\n<br>**cpchest:** pain type\n<br>**trestbps:** resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n<br>**chol:** serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n<br>**fbs:** (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n<br>**restecg:** resting electrocardiographic results\n<br>**thalach:** maximum heart rate achieved\n<br>**exang:** exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n<br>**oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n<br>**slope:** the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n<br>**ca:** number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n<br>**thal:** 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect\n<br>**target:**  1= Yes.
