Introduction**\n\nThe data is presented in OHLC format in 1min resolution with additional volumetric and valuation data points like volume traded (VolB) and value traded (VolC). Using these additional data points, a volume weighted average price (WgtPx) is derived. (For completeness, WgtPx is included in the supplied data).\n\nTraditional time series analysis relies on a typical relationship like Y[t] = f( Y[t-1], Y[t-2]…) where Y = price at time with a laundry list of over-arching assumptions. Using the data in the such format, technical analysis/indicators like SMA(15) are constructed. This following discussion will deviate from such norms and focuses on price action of the WgtPx i.e. Given the relative positions of OHLC in each snapshot, what is the relative movement of WgtPx in the next snapshot?\n\nIt should be noted the definition of WgtPx implies that ’market clearing’ benchmark over the said time horizon and therefore the relative movements of this said benchmark presents a view of the underlying valuation (V) of the financial instrument/asset. This is the discussion’s hypothesis.\n\nThe above approach also assumes that the change in price is a ‘not-so-random’ walk (with drift?) and therefore the underlying price action is a leading indicator for V. Price action is opined to be readily observed in markets where liquidity and price volatility are highest, but anything that is bought or sold freely in a market will per se demonstrate price action (Source: Wikipedia). In this case, the Bitcoin market fits the former description.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"954aed6a-1be6-44b2-877f-19c8c44fab47","_uuid":"fa75708fbc95c952593d79d759948ed6ffc08404"},"execution_count":null},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2.
