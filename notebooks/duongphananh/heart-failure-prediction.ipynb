Conditions \n\nA lot of the binary data seems to focus on conditions the patient might face before the death.\n\n* **Anaemia: Basically the decrease of red blood cells, or hemoglobin. In a healthy person's blood there are more than just the red-looking substance as there are also plasma and plateles, so a decrease in hemoglobin might suggest a blockache, or in general how little oxygen is being carried around.**\n\n* **Diabetes: This condition is probably famous, basically there's too much sugar in your blood. I don't know the relevance of the type of diabetes, since some are innate and genetic, while some are developed later in life. I'll assume this only concerns whether a person's blood glucose is high.**\n\n* **High blood pressure: Exactly what it sounds like, your blood pressure is too high. Usually prevalent in older people with conditions like the aforementioned diabetes, or just an unsual sodium-rich diet.**\n\n* **Smoking: Well, we'll see if smoking kills.**\n\n### Sex\n\nLet's begin with a heatmap to see where we need to go first."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"main = \"#68C643\"\nsecondary = \"#A144C5\"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(raw[[\"anaemia\", \"diabetes\", \"smoking\", \"high_blood_pressure\", \"sex\"]].corr(), annot=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well, there seems to be **a very notable** correlation between gender and smoking.

These are not typically abundant in the bloodstream, and leak out when tissues are damaged.\n* Ejection fraction (%): The percentage of blood that leaves the heart in each contractions.\n* Platelets (kiloplateletes/mL): The amount of plateles in the blood.\n* Serum creatinine (mg/dL): Level of serum cretinine in the blood. All I know is that this thing is a waste product caused by the natural wear and tear of the body.\n* Serum sodium (mEq/L): The amount of sodium, or... kinda salt presented in the body.\n\nSo we can assume that except for the ejection fraction and plateles, high levels of the other columns typically mean the body is under danger. Lower amounts of sodium can also typically lead to unhealthy conditions. As for the ejection, because we are accounting for heart failure, we can assume that a lower percentage of blood leaving the body can be quite a telltale sign.\n\nIt is a protocol at this point, but let's draw up another heatmap."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"levels_df = raw[[\"creatinine_phosphokinase\", \"ejection_fraction\", \"platelets\", \"serum_creatinine\", \"serum_sodium\", \"DEATH_EVENT\"]]\nsns.heatmap(levels_df.corr(), annot=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Right...!
