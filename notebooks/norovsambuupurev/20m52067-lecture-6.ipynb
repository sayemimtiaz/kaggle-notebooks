The video, urging people to stay home, was only published after 1 month from the first local case. And more shockingly, government is lifting restriction when daily cases are increasing day-by-day. After seeing the data and graph, I think government actions are not enough to contain the COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, I believe lifting the restrictions will make the situation worse. \n\nReference;\nUS embassy in Mexico\nhttps://mx.usembassy.gov/health-alert-mexico-covid-19-update-06-11-2020/\nWorld Health Organization\nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
