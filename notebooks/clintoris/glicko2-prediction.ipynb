I wanted to start out without using machine learning, although I might expand my notebook with some machine learning techniques later. My main idea was to use the Glicko2 system for rating players. This is one of the most widely used systems for rating players within games employed for games such as chess. I used this first of all on a team-level instead of the players individually, since I could not find sources yet which implement this for team games, although they most certainly exist.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport datetime\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport scipy\n\n\n\nd_picks = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/csgo-professional-matches/picks.csv\")\nd_economy = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/csgo-professional-matches/economy.csv\")\nd_results = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/csgo-professional-matches/results.csv\")\nd_players = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/csgo-professional-matches/players.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import asyncio\n\"\"\"\nADAPTED FROM https://github.com/ryankirkman/pyglicko2/blob/master/glicko2.py\n\nCopyright (c) 2009 Ryan Kirkman\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
