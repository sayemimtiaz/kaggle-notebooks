From Kobe Bryant's tragic passing to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year was already a dumpster fire in the making. But wait, there's more! Just when no one thought 2020 could get worse, George Floyd was murdered in cold blood by officers in the Minneapolis Police Department. Sparking national outrage, this event created the most volatile flashpoint in US politics today centered around the ideas of police brutality, systemic racism, and the role of government in elicting change. As pundits from the entire political spectrum offer their takes on what all is going on, the data lays in wait, holding the numbers that can inform the truth. In this notebook, I seek to cut through some of the buzz to see what's really going on using data to inform my conclusions. I do want to stress that this is a very delicate and nuanced issue, and that preconceived notions have to take a backseat when evaluating data and asking questions.  \n  \nThis notebook is structured as follows: \n* Setup and Data\n* Data Read-In and Characteristics\n* Exploratory Data Analysis:  \n1) Univariate Analysis  \n2) Geospatial EDA  \n3) Multi-Variate Analysis  \n* Conclusion\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup and Data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Libraries","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport datetime as datetime\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom pandas.plotting import autocorrelation_plot\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Functions","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def add_value_labels(ax, spacing=5):\n    \"\"\"Add labels to the end of each bar in a bar chart.\n\n    Arguments:\n        ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes): The matplotlib object containing the axes\n            of the plot to annotate.\n        spacing (int): The distance between the labels and the bars.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # For each bar: Place a label\n    for rect in ax.patches:\n        # Get X and Y placement of label from rect.\n        y_value = rect.get_height()\n        x_value = rect.get_x() + rect.get_width() / 2\n\n        # Number of points between bar and label.

Unlike their female counterparts, white males are significantly underrepresented compared to their relative proportion of the male population (60% pop vs 50% shooting victims). Black males and Hispanic males are therefore overrepresented relative to all males, but the discrepancy in representation is similar between Hispanic males and females (18% vs 12%) and black males and females (27% vs 21%).

With that being said, it is important to note that the data here might not be fully capturing what is going on with this issue due to incomplete or low quality reporting. Data collection improvements would result in a clearer truth. I have tried to maintain as objective and neutral a lens as possible when evaluating my takeaways from this analysis. Some conclusions I have drawn from this data:  \n* Black people are being killed by police at disproportionately high rates.    \n* There does not seem to be a trend up or down over time for fatal police shootings.  \n* Men make up the vast majority of fatal police shooting victims.  \n* The number of fatal shootings in a city seems to largely depend on its population.  \n* Body cameras rarely capture footage in these encounters.  \n* Most victims were not fleeing from police when they were fatally shot.  \n\n\nSome of my thoughts related to my conclusions from the data:\n* The absolute number of unarmed people killed in general is extremely small relative to the hundreds of millions of interactions between police and civilians on a yearly basis.  \n* There are no objective indicators or reporting of crime or threat posed to officer in this data. One suggestion is to make body camera footage mandatory, then have a neutral party review fatal shooting footage and make a determination on if the victim was truly endangering the officer's life.  \n* On that point, officer body camera footage is not as frequent as I thought it was prior to this analysis. Ideally, a body camera should be recording every interaction to ensure accountability of both the officer and the other party(s) involved   \n* Socioeconomic class may be a confounding factor. It could be informative to take a look at fatal police shootings broken down first by both race and socioeconomic status. How do white people of low socioeconomic status fare against black people of high socio-economic status?  \n* While this data does indicate that black people are killed at higher than expected rates, it does not provide enough additional evidence to confirm that police are consistently disproportionately targeting black people overall. To confirm that, additional data on traffic stops by race, warranted arrests vs unwarranted arrests, non-fatal police brutality, fatal police brutality not involving a firearm, a case by case report on the circumstances and potential crime of the person in question, among others, would be required to make such a broad claim.  \n* Regardless of your views around this issue, I think we can all agree that police should strive to minimize the use of lethal force in anyway possible.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
