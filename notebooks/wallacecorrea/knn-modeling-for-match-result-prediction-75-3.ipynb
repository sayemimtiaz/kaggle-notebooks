This makes it very hard to isolate each variable's influence to build a model.\n* Very influent human factors: players are susceptible to making decisive bad plays and lose games they should have won.\n* Small time gap analyzed: 10 minutes can be as little as 20% of the total duration of a regular game, so we're extrapolating a lot of info here.\n* Some characters are better at different time stages of the game, creating a certain bias involving exactly which ones were being played at that specific match.\n\nConsidering the factors above and the amount of delicate points that determine the outcome of a match, i would say 75.3% of accuracy using a simple model such as this one is a very decent result. It also reflects a certain level of predictability that reiterates how games at a higher skill level tend to have less room for human mistakes, because each player is playing much closer to their character and situation's maximum potential. It's probably much harder to predict results involving average players because their games involve a lot more random human mistakes, thus being less predictable.\n\nOne very relevant conclusion, however, is that over this statistical approach it becomes really clear that, at the end of the day, wards placed and destroyed at the early game don't make a lot of difference on deciding the game winner. Based on my game knowledge, my guess is that the warding relevance ramps up over the course of the game, because at the start both teams have all the towers, so the players have a lot less space to do vision-based outplays. This, combined with the fact that high-level players, with their experience, can guess very well what is happening without necessarily having vision of the enemy, may justify this fact.\n\nIf you liked this notebook and found it useful in any way, i'd greatly appreciate your upvote :)\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
