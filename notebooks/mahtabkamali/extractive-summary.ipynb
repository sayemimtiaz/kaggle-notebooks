A high recall method that extracts articles. (We started by  mentions of 'risk' and 'covid')\n2. A ranking algorithm. (We ranked the articles  based on the frequency of 'risk' in their abstract).\n3. An extractive summarization algorithm that extract the relevant part of the selected articles (We use BERT summarization   algorithm here).\n4. Ideally expert feedback on relevancy of the extracted content (I am no expertt but I plan to read random sample of both population :) ) \n5. Another extractive summary between all articles that were selected.\n6. Abstractive summary of that selection.\n7. Visulazation of what was achieved. \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport json\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom copy import deepcopy\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\nimport glob\nimport sys\n\nsys.path.insert(0, \"../\")\n\nroot_path = '/kaggle/input/'\n\ncorona_features = {\"doc_id\": [None], \"source\": [None], \"title\": [None],\n                  \"abstract\": [None], \"text_body\": [None]}\ncorona_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(corona_features)\n\njson_filenames = glob.glob(f'{root_path}/**/*.json', recursive=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def return_corona_df(json_filenames, df):\n\n    for file_name in json_filenames:\n\n        row = {\"doc_id\": None, \"source\": None, \"title\": None,\n              \"abstract\": None, \"text_body\": None}\n\n        with open(file_name) as json_data:\n            data = json.load(json_data)\n\n            doc_id = data['paper_id']\n            row['doc_id'] = doc_id\n            row['title'] = data['metadata']['title']\n\n            # Now need all of abstract.
