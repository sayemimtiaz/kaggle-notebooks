Conclusion**\n--\nNow wrapping up the project and making our final analysis we see that there are some interesting trends going on with this data. There seems to be a shift in genres where intensity is more wanted in games. It started out as sports, platform, and adventure games being the highest selling genres, but evolved into action, fighting, and above all else currently shooter games. Genres like sports and platform have consistently been high selling and now adventure and puzzle games are the lowest selling genres at the moment.\n    \nThe other question we were looking at answering was about which publishers have had the most influence over the video game market. When just thinking about the word influence over these four decades the obvious conclusion is Nintendo. They have been a dominate force in the video game market since the 80s and have consistently stayed there too present day. Publishers like Activision, Microsoft Studios, Sony Entertainment and 505 Games have also showed that they can consistently pull in high global sales as well.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the unfortunate problems that were ran into during this project. The first being that there were just big of difference in observations between each decade. The second is that global sales do not necessarily answer the above question of popularity. I am sure they do a good job at being very similar to what popularity would be, but global sales is not necessarily the best indicator of popularity. If we had units sold information on each game then that would be the perfect variable to insert for this question. If I were doing this project again I would definitely pay more attention to what is in each variable before I make a big question too answer, and I would also think about taking some random samples from each decade (about 150 samples from each) and then look at the trends. I feel that some of the information might turn out different if that is done. The tricky part is that the decades are so spread out in terms of observations that 150 samples might not accurately represent the 2000s which had 9000 observations. Nevertheless, that is food for thought for my future self looking at this project.\n    ","metadata":{}}]}
