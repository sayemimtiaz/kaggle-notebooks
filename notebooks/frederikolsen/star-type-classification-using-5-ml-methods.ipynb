Therefore, what is described in the Bar plot above will likely vary each time this notebook is re-run.\n\nDue to the variability in accuracy scores recorded by each model with every re-run, comparison between models is not always obvious. \n\nHowever, it is reasonable to conclude that the Random Forest Classifier is the best of the five models investigated. This is due to it usually obtaining 100% accuracy on the testing data.\n\nAdditionally, it is also reasonable to conclude that the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier is the worst of the five models investigated. This is due to it recording the lowest testing data accuracy scores of all of the models investigated (usually 82-93%), and the fact that all other methods were capable of obtaining 100% accuracy on the testing data.\n\nThe Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier and Deep Learning MLP are unfortunately less clear to compare and rank as they were all capable of obtaining 100% accuracy. However, the Support Vector Classifier was the most consistent of these three with the range of accuracy scores being between 95-100%. As such it may be reasonable for this method to be considered the second best after the Random Forest Classifier. By the same logic, it may therefore be reasonable to conclude that the Deep Learning MLP is the third best overall (testing data accuracy 90-100%), and the K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier is the fourth best (testing data accuracy 88-100%), only better than the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
