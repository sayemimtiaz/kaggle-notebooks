Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy\n\nWithout ongoing, careful management, diabetes can lead to a buildup of sugars in the blood, which can increase the risk of dangerous complications, including stroke and heart disease.\n\nDifferent kinds of diabetes can occur, and managing the condition depends on the type. Not all forms of diabetes stem from a person being overweight or leading an inactive lifestyle. In fact, some are present from childhood.\n\n### Context\nThis dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\n### Content\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\n\n### Inspiration\nCan you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 1 - Data Preprocessing\n\n## Importing Important Libraries"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing the Dataset"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/pima-indians-diabetes-database/diabetes.csv')\ndata                  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Handling Missing Data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Even though we can see that there are no missing data in the dataset but if we look closer in this data, we find out that there are a lot of values as zero in features that make no sense.

You just let the algorithm handle the missing data. Some algorithms can factor in the missing values and learn the best imputation values for the missing data based on the training loss reduction (ie. XGBoost)However, other algorithms will panic and throw an error complaining about the missing values (ie. Scikit learn — LinearRegression). In that case, you will need to handle the missing data and clean it before feeding it to the algorithm.\n\n**Imputation Using (Mean/Median) Values**:\n\nThis works by calculating the mean/median of the non-missing values in a column and then replacing the missing values within each column separately and independently from the others. It can only be used with numeric data.\n\nPros:\n  * Easy and fast.\n  * Works well with small numerical datasets.\n\nCons:\n  * Doesn’t factor the correlations between features. It only works on the column level.\n  * Will give poor results on encoded categorical features (do NOT use it on categorical features).\n  * Not very accurate.\n  * Doesn’t account for the uncertainty in the imputations\n\n**Imputation Using (Most Frequent) or (Zero/Constant) Values**:\n\nMost Frequent is another statistical strategy to impute missing values and YES!! It works with categorical features (strings or numerical representations) by replacing missing data with the most frequent values within each column.\n\nPros:\n  * Works well with categorical features.\n\nCons:\n  * It also doesn’t factor the correlations between features.\n  * It can introduce bias in the data.\n\n**Imputation Using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE)**:\n\nThis type of imputation works by filling the missing data multiple times. Multiple Imputations (MIs) are much better than a single imputation as it measures the uncertainty of the missing values in a better way. The chained equations approach is also very flexible and can handle different variables of different data types (ie., continuous or binary) as well as complexities such as bounds or survey skip patterns.\n\n**Imputation Using Deep Learning (Datawig)**:\n\nThis method works very well with categorical and non-numerical features. It is a library that learns Machine Learning models using Deep Neural Networks to impute missing values in a dataframe. It also supports both CPU and GPU for training.\n\nPros:\n  * Quite accurate compared to other methods.\n  * It has some functions that can handle categorical data (Feature Encoder).\n  * It supports CPUs and GPUs.\n\nCons:\n  * Single Column imputation.\n  * Can be quite slow with large datasets.\n  * You have to specify the columns that contain information about the target column that will be imputed."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['BMI']=data.BMI.mask(data.BMI == 0,(data['BMI'].mean(skipna=True)))\ndata['SkinThickness']=data.SkinThickness.mask(data.SkinThickness == 0,(data['SkinThickness'].mean(skipna=True)))\ndata['BloodPressure']=data.BloodPressure.mask(data.BloodPressure == 0,(data['BloodPressure'].mean(skipna=True)))\ndata['Glucose']=data.Glucose.mask(data.Glucose == 0,(data['Glucose'].mean(skipna=True)))\nprint(data.head(15))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Binning of Data\n\nData binning, bucketing is a data pre-processing method used to minimize the effects of small observation errors.
