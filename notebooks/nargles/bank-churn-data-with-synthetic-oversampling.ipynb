The next steps following this analysis will be to apply the trained model to the user base to see if the model marks any existing users as Churned. Following you should monitor and record data of the status of the marked clients without intervention to understand if the model is accurately classifying potentially churned customers. Following a successful monitoring period, intervention techniques should be discussed, and which methods would prove beneficial. Then create sample groups for each type of intervention technique and record data to analyze which intervention technique is the most efective for which groups of individuals for effective targeted intervention in the future. \n   \n   Out of all the users who are predicted to be churned. Roughly 1% of them will be classfied as existing users. This could be due to the margin of error because with any predicion. There is no way of being 100% certain an individual will churn or not. Maybe they got offered a better rate at a different bank, and they are loyal customer who happened to make a financially smart decision. I think 1/100 individuals is an acceptable tolerance given the technology availiable to us. If this is applied to J.P. Morgan Chase, which had a total net revunue of 115 billion USD in the year 2019, and claims to serve 63 million households. First, we need to calculate the amount of wrong predictions among the 63 million clients. This comes out to 63,000 clients, let us assume each household is worth 14,000 USD each year. The yearly financial impact of the wrong predictions equate to 882 million USD per year. This is a .007% impact, and can easily be outpaced by projected revenue growth of a company on that scale. According to YoY revenue growth between 2018 and 2019, J.P. Morgan had a .94% increase in revenue which is about 6 billion USD. Given this knowledge our 1% error will only affect YoY revenue growth by .147%. \n   \n   A presentation is formed with all the relevant information and explainations about the overall financial impacts and costs associated with the transition to the new model. Then executive leadership would make a decision on whether the provided information justifies the transitsion to the new model, or the executive leadership will request more research be conducted about this aspect of the financial impact.
