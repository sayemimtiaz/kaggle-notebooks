Pradesh is having very poor numbers for this case,as low as 73.97% overall.This could be because the state has ever changing goverment and most of its school are goverment controlled and funded by goverment and also boys can litter in open place so they did not require the need for having Boys toilets.But I think the numbers are increasing since,PM Modi announced Swachh Bharat Campaign which

Primary and Lower Secondary schools contribute to this schocking results,whereas higher secondary institutes are still having a good percentage of electricity supply,that is the reason why the results have slightly gone up.\nAlso the regions which have 100% of their schools equipped with electricity facilities are basically Union Territories and have less,but well developed schools,that's the prime
