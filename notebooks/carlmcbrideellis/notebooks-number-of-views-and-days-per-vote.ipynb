{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Notebooks: Number of views per vote\nI thought it would be interesting to take a quick look at the distribution of the number views that a notebook receives for each upvote earned. We can see from the plot below that the modal class is around **40 views per vote**, in other words typically only around **2.5%** of the time does a viewer decide that a notebook is worthy their vote. \n\n### Update (September 2020):\nI have re-ran this notebook using the latest data, and in the three months since the creation of this notebook there has been a slight change in voting habits. There is now a plateau of votes between **10-40 views per vote**. Still, in the most optimistic of cases only **10%** of the time does a viewer decide that a notebook is worthy their vote.
