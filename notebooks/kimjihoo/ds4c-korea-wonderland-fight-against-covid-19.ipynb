Transparency\nKorea's testing and diagnostic capabilities are outstanding, delivering results within hours. It runs over 20,000 test per day and releases the data instantaneously.\n### 2. Robust Screening and Quarantine\nKorea aggressively maps and tracks infected cases. Self-quarantines are strictly monitored and enforced - violators risk impriosnment and fines.\n### 3. Unique but Universally-applicable\nKorea uses IT technology and drvie-through testing sites to minimize contact. Mobile apps track the condition and movement of infected individuals.\n### 4. Strict Control\nKorea prohibits individuals who have been in contact with confirmed cases from exiting Korea during the 14-day self-quarantine period.\n### 5. Treatment\nKorea provides advanced medical care to confirmed patients. Treatment is free-of-charge for both Koreans and foreign nationals.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input/coronavirusdataset'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"path = '/kaggle/input/coronavirusdataset/'\n\ncase = p_info = pd.read_csv(path+'Case.csv')\np_info = pd.read_csv(path+'PatientInfo.csv')\np_route = pd.read_csv(path+'PatientRoute.csv')\ntime = pd.read_csv(path+'Time.csv')\nt_age = pd.read_csv(path+'TimeAge.csv')\nt_gender = pd.read_csv(path+'TimeGender.csv')\nt_provin = pd.read_csv(path+'TimeProvince.csv')\nregion = pd.read_csv(path+'Region.csv')\nweather = pd.read_csv(path+'Weather.csv')\nsearch = pd.read_csv(path+'SearchTrend.csv')\nfloating = pd.read_csv(path+'SeoulFloating.csv')\n\ndt = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/covid19-screening-center/dt.csv')\nkor_province = '/kaggle/input/covid19-screening-center/TL_SCCO_SIG_WGS84.json'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make new test/confirmed/released/deceased from accumulated counts\nnew_test = [1]\nnew_negative = [0]\nnew_confirmed = [1]\nnew_released = [0]\nnew_deceased = [0]\n\nfor i in range(len(time['date'])-1):\n    new_test.append(time['test'][i+1] - time['test'][i])\n    new_negative.append(time['negative'][i+1] - time['negative'][i])\n    new_confirmed.append(time['confirmed'][i+1] - time['confirmed'][i])\n    new_released.append(time['released'][i+1] - time['released'][i])\n    new_deceased.append(time['deceased'][i+1] - time['deceased'][i])\n    \ntime['new_test'] = new_test\ntime['new_negative'] = new_negative\ntime['new_confirmed'] = new_confirmed\ntime['new_released'] = new_released\ntime['new_deceased'] = new_deceased","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

Drive-Through Screening Center\nAs the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is ongoing, the number of individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing. For safe and efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been designed and implemented in Korea. Herein, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers. The steps of the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and instructions. The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without leaving his or her cars. Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging. It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global COVID-19 outbreak and transformed according to their own situations.\n\nSource: [Drive-Through Screening Center for COVID-19: a Safe and Efficient Screening System against Massive Community Outbreak](https://jkms.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e123)\n\n![DT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50820635/78366270-38e51600-75fb-11ea-98fa-f306c9a40a35.PNG)  \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Location of the DT Screening Centers\nSource: [MOHW (Ministry of Health and Welfare)](https://www.mohw.go.kr/react/popup_200128_4.html)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import folium \nimport json\nfrom folium import plugins\n\nm = folium.Map([36, 128], zoom_start=7) \n\nplugins.Fullscreen(position='topright',  # Full screen\n                   title='Click to Expand', \n                   title_cancel='Click to Exit', \n                   force_separate_button=True).add_to(m)\n\nplugins.MousePosition().add_to(m) ## you can easily get coordinates.\n\nwith open('/kaggle/input/covid19-screening-center/TL_SCCO_SIG_WGS84.json',mode='rt',encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    geo = json.loads(f.read())\n    f.close()\n    \nfolium.GeoJson(\n    geo,\n    name='seoul_municipalities'\n).add_to(m)\n\nfor i in range(len(dt)):\n\n    location = (dt['latitude'][i],dt['longitude'][i])\n    folium.Marker(location, popup = dt['province'][i], icon = folium.Icon(color = 'gray')).add_to(m)\n\nm","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## To be continued.."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
