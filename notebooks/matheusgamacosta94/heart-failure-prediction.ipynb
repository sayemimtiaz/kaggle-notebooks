Introduction<center><h24>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The present work was intended to analyze some data related to people's health. So known that cardiovascular diseases(CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, and heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs, the  <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data\"><strong>Heart Failure Prediction</strong></a> dataset was chosen.\n\nAssuming most cardiovascular diseases preventeble by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity using population-wide strategies. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management.\n\nIn that way, machine learning models can help to the early risk identifcation. So, in the flolowing sections we will take a look to the data, making a initial analysis and quick visualization. Futher some transformation was made to make the data more presentable to the modeling process. Finaly, a model was created to detect the heart failure. In the end a short conclusion was made, where can be helpful for the strategies taken to prevent the heart failure.\n\nIt is important to remember this is a Notebook to study purposes only.\n\nThis notebook was created by [Matheus Gama Costa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-gama-costa-903456a6/).

The creatinine phosphokinase and diabetes, also do not show a good correlation (around 0.062 and -0.001 respectively). This information is very visual in the histogram and box plots, and is coroborated with de statistical correlation.\n\n### The ejection fraction, in other hand have a negative correlation (around -0.268), so, as it increase the chance of have a heart failure decrease. \n\n### We can see another couple of factors that do not have a good correlation, high blood pressure, and platelets. We have to reinforce that what we are talking about here is about the data, motherless clinically a high blood pressure is an indicator of heart problem, in this dataset it appears to not have a good correlation with the chance of having a death per heart failure.\n\n### The serum creatinine and serum sodium levels are good indicators of the occurrence of death per heart failure. The first has a positive correlation and the second a negative correlation.\n\n### The sex does not appear to have a low correlation with the deaths registered. \n\n### The time shows the best correlation to the death event.
