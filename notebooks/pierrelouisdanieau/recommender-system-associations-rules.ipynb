Their search for the next product to buy is facilitated, and their user experience is therefore significantly improved. Customers are therefore more satisfied.\n\n* **For the company :** As far as the company is concerned, a recommendation engine allows to improve the loyalty of its customers. As they are satisfied with the products they buy, they are more likely to collaborate with the company. The churn rate decreases, allowing the company to reduce its costs related to the acquisition of new customers. And of course, the company sees its turnover increase with the proposition of new products to the customers with cross selling.\n\nThe recommendation engine developed is therefore based on a public dataset proposed by [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) . This dataset contains the transaction history of an online store over 1 year.\n\nThe goal of the system is therefore to propose 1 product to each customer based on their current shopping basket that maximizes the probability of purchase. The final table is composed of the customer identifiers associated with the product that is proposed to him and the associated purchase probability. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

Association Rules modelling : Fp growth algorithm","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Fp Growth is a Data Mining model based on **association rules**.\n\nThis model allows, from a transaction history, to determine the set of most frequent association rules in the dataset. To do so, it needs as input parameter the set of transactions composed of the product baskets the customers have already purchased. \n\nGiven a dataset of transactions, the first step of FP-growth is to calculate item frequencies and identify frequent items.\n\nThe second step of FP-growth uses a suffix tree (FP-tree) structure to encode transactions without generating candidate sets explicitly, which are usually expensive to generate. After the second step, the frequent itemsets can be extracted from the FP-tree and the model returns a set of product association rules like the example below: \n\n            {Product A + Product B} --> {Product C} with 60% probability\n            {Product B + Product C} --> {Product A + Product D} with 78% probability\n            {Prodcut C} --> {Product B + Product D} with 67% probability\n            etc.\n            \nTo establish this table, the model needs to be provided with 2 hyperparameters :\n* **minSupRatio** : minimum support for an itemset to be identified as frequent. For example, if an item appears 3 out of 5 transactions, it has a support of 3/5=0.6.\n* **minConf** :minimum confidence for generating Association Rule. Confidence is an indication of how often an association rule has been found to be true. For example, if in the transactions itemset X appears 4 times, X and Y co-occur only 2 times, the confidence for the rule X => Y is then 2/4 = 0.5. The parameter will not affect the mining for frequent itemsets, but specify the minimum confidence for generating association rules from frequent itemsets.\n\nOnce the association rules have been calculated, all you have to do is apply them to the customers' product baskets.
