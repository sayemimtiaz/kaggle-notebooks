Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to. All bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins.<br>\n<t>The bitcoin system is a collection of computers (also referred to as \"nodes\" or \"miners\") that all run bitcoin's code and store its blockchain. Metaphorically, a blockchain can be thought of as a collection of blocks. In each block is a collection of transactions. Because all the computers running the blockchain has the same list of blocks and transactions, and can transparently see these new blocks being filled with new bitcoin transactions, no one can cheat the system.\n<br>\nAnyone, whether they run a bitcoin \"node\" or not, can see these transactions occurring live. In order to achieve a nefarious act, a bad actor would need to operate 51% of the computing power that makes up bitcoin. Bitcoin has around 12,000 nodes, as of January 2021, and this number is growing.\n\nSo we will view the market trends and wheather its still worth it to invest in it?","metadata":{"id":"9qiaB14Sp9Mg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.674056Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.674503Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.694083Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.674469Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.693296Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cd /kaggle/input/","metadata":{"id":"zoSxU_m2Y5x0","outputId":"3eb8b18a-796a-47e5-b70f-1429e300ee0e","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.699469Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.70003Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.709933Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.699991Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.709104Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport requests\nfrom time import sleep\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score,mean_squared_error","metadata":{"id":"AxKIJ2XTYKVr","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.711936Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.713047Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T19:37:48.585287Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T19:37:47.713006Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T19:37:48.584459Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have the kaggle dataset ,can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data).","metadata":{"id":"2hif879JrksX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data=pd.read_csv('bitcoin-historical-data/bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2021-03-31.csv')","metadata":{"id":"wRSh0FUpYI6B","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T19:37:48.586858Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T19:37:48.587184Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.81477Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T19:37:48.587149Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.813884Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","metadata":{"id":"ClG8jGBkYI6E","outputId":"96a4d336-2473-4cc1-b813-67f97fb074ec","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.817349Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.817928Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.838942Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.817882Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.837986Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data","metadata":{"id":"Ja5GoYOKYI6B","outputId":"9a67b4df-3b86-4f7b-a967-e9deb395f20e","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.84036Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.840741Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.865292Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.840703Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T19:37:54.864537Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From above we can see that their are many null values, so let's check how many null values are their:","metadata":{"id":"wHpj_xq8r3PD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for col in data.columns:                \n    print(\"Number of null values in col \",col,\" is: \",data[col].isnull().sum()) ##

above we can see their was variation between the prices and their corresponding number of trades, as the price increases the number of trades also decreases as we have seen that their is large difference in prices on daily basis, means as the prices goes up , it also went down in same way , so it might become quite difficult for less experience traders to trade for higer price range.

Conclusion:\n- If someone wants to trade in bitcoin then need to watch the prices on daily basis ,because the variation in price for down and up trend are in same proportion , so one need to look for square off for the price trades in order to make profit.\n- The miner or the investor who had trade bitcoin during the year around 2014 or before 2014 would have more wealth now , because the volume was more and the prices were less,so they have make more profit percentage as compare to 2021.\n- Highest price trades are made in 2021 ,but the avg. prices was still very less which shows most of the investors are not aggressive trader or who has fear of loss or less domain knowledge.\n- The Avg. price volume was highest for 2021 and that is for the data of 3 months only ,which represents that even in quarter time we huge trade was occur this year and it may increases by the end of the year.\n- The growth in prices in starting of 2021 is almost kind of exponential and some of the reports mentioned that it might hit 100K USD by end of year ,so if one wants to trade then he good profit could be made by end of the year.\n- For a particular day the highest price and lowest price difference is almost negligible as compared to overall change in year or month,which shows those values have significant changes in prices after 24 hours.\n- The best season to make profit from BTC is winter season , as price for bitcoin get increases for those period in the year.
