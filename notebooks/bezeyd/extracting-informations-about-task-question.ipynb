For a given question we start by selecting the most similar papers to this question. Those papers are likely those which can contain answers for the questions:\n\n    *In this step we will start by importing and preprocess the different documents then we will use **Glove** which is a nlp pretrained model on wikipedia corpus that will provide us we embedding for the abstract of each document and an other embedding for the question. Those two vecoriel resprenstation (embeddings) will be used to calculate the similarity between each document and the given question. then  we keep the most similar paper with the question (those paper which has the a score of similarity greater than a given threshold).*\n    \n2. Extract keywords and key sentences from the given question (using a nlp model).\n\n    *In this step we will extract keywords and key sentences form the question. For that we will use the Spacy en_core_web_md model which is an english multi-task CNN trained on OntoNotes, with GloVe vectors trained on Common Crawl, to extract keywords. We will also use nltk_rake to extract key sentences form the question.*\n\n3. Output sentences\n\n    *This step will provide us with the output of the notebook. \n    For each keyword or key sentence and each similar paper we will return the sentences from the pape's body which contain the keyword/key sentence if and only if the paper contains together this keyword and the word covid19 or coronavirus.*\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np #
