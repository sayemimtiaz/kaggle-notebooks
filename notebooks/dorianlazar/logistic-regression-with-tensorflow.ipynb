Among them is the Keras API which can be used to build a logistic regression model very quickly, as you can see above. And there’s nothing wrong with that. If you have to implement a complex deep learning model, that perhaps you saw in a new paper, Keras saves you a lot of time; it lets you focus on what’s important and don’t have to care about each math operation that has to be done.  \nBut, if your purpose is to learn a basic machine learning technique, like logistic regression, it is worth it using the core math functions from TensorFlow and implementing it from scratch.    \nKnowing TensorFlow’s lower-level math APIs also can help you building a deep learning model when you need to implement a custom training loop, or a custom activation or loss function. It can also be more fun!  \nSo, let’s get started!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To understand better what we’re going to do next, you can read [this article about logistic regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-logistic-regression-81779525d5c6).  \nWhat's our plan for implementing Logistic Regression with TensorFlow?  \nLet's first think of the underlying math that we want to use.  \nThere are many ways to define a loss function and then find the optimal parameters for it, among them, here we will implement in our `LogisticRegression` class the following 3 ways for learning the parameters:\n- We will rewrite the logistic regression equation so that we turn it into a least-squares linear regression problem with different labels and then, we use the closed-form formula to find the weights: ![at text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazuxd/logistic-regression-with-tensorflow/main/imgs/eq1.png)  \n- Like above, we turn logistic into least-squares linear regression, but instead of the closed-form formula, we use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the following loss function: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazuxd/logistic-regression-with-tensorflow/main/imgs/eq4.png) which was obtained by substituting the y in the sum of squared errors loss ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazuxd/logistic-regression-with-tensorflow/main/imgs/eq3.png) with the right-hand side of ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazuxd/logistic-regression-with-tensorflow/main/imgs/eq2.png)  \n- We use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, write the likelihood function, play around with it, restate it as a minimization problem, and apply SGD with the following loss function: ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazuxd/logistic-regression-with-tensorflow/main/imgs/eq5.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the above equations, X is the input matrix that contains observations on the row axis and features on the column axis; y is a column vector that contains the classification labels (0 or 1); f is the sum of squared errors loss function; h is the loss function for the MLE method.   \nIf you want to find out more about how we obtained the above equations, please check out the above-linked article.   \nSo now, this is our goal: translate the above equations into code. And we’ll use TensorFlow for that.   \nWe plan to use an object-oriented approach for implementation. We'll create a `LogisticRegression` class with 3 public methods: `fit()`, `predict()`, and `accuracy()`.   \nAmong fit's parameters, one will determine how our model learns. This parameter is named method (not to be confused with a method as a function of a class) and it can take the following strings as values: 'ols_solve' (OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares), 'ols_sgd’, and 'mle_sgd’.   \nTo not make the `fit()` method too long, we would like to split the code into 3 different private methods, each one responsible for one way of finding the parameters.   \nWe will have the `__ols_solve()` private method for applying the closed-form formula.  \nIn this method and in the other methods that use the OLS approach, we will use the constant EPS to make sure the labels are not exactly 0 or 1, but something in between. That’s to avoid getting plus or minus infinity for the logarithm in the equations above.   \nIn `__ols_solve()` we first check if X has full column rank so that we can apply this method. Then we force y to be between EPS and 1-EPS. The `ols_y` variable holds the labels of the ordinary least-squares linear regression problem that’s equivalent to our logistic regression problem. Basically, we transform the labels that we have for logistic regression so that they are compliant with the linear regression equations. After that, we apply the closed-form formula using TensorFlow functions.

Instead, it will expect as a parameter a function responsible for computing the loss value which the `__sgd()` method will use.   \nIn this method, we first initialize the weights to a random column vector with values drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1/(# of features). The intuition for this std dev is that if we have more features, then we need smaller weights to be able to converge (and not blow up our gradients). Then we go through all the dataset for `iterations` times. At the start of each such iteration, we randomly shuffle our dataset, then for each batch of data, we compute the loss value using the `loss_fn` function taken as a parameter, then use TensorFlow to take the gradient of this loss value with respect to (w.r.t.) `self.weights` and update the weights.   \nThe loss needs to be computed inside `with tf.GradientTape() as tape:` block.
