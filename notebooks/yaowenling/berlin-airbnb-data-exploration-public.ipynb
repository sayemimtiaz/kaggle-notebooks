{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Intro\n\nThe dataset contains 22,552 Airbnb listings in Berlin as of November 2018. For each listing we have the information about the property (e.g. property type, location, number of accommodated guests, cancellation policy, etc) and the host (e.g. whether the host is a super host, whether the identity of the host has been verified). \n\nThe goal of this project is to identify the factors that have the biggest impact on daily price of each listing. Below are some hypotheses that I have in mind before starting the analysis (although I actually have only used Aribnb once so far):\n* **Location**: the closer the property is to some top locations in Berlin (e.g. Berlin main train station, Reichtag, etc), the higher the price.\n* **Property type**: the price of an entire apartment should be higher than a shared apartment or a single bedroom.\n* **Host quality**: according to Airbnb page (https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/829/how-do-i-become-a-superhost), a host will become a superhost if he/she has both been an experience traveler and host and achived higher overall ratings. Properties that are offered by superhosts should have a higher price.\n* **Amenities**: if the property has offered some special amenities that others don't (e.g. TV, hangers, a laptop-friendly workplace), it should have a higher price.\n* **Policies**: properties with more favorable policies (e.g. more flexible cancellation policy) will haev a higher price.\n\nThe project can be devided into two parts:\n1. Explanatory data analysis: data cleansing, data visualisation, summary statistisc, feature engineering\n2. Feature importance using XGBoost (with Grid Search for model selection)\n\nThe explanatory analysis has confirmed most of the hypotheses above with statistical significance. In the end, two factors stand out as the most important features when predicting the daily price of Airbnb listings in Berlin:\n\n🏘 Property types: the price of an entire apartment is higher than a shared apartment or a single bedroom.\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Accommodates: the more guests a property can host, the higher the price. This variable is a good proxy of the size of the property (which is not explicitly provided in the dataset)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Explanatory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 1: Load the dataset\n\nFirst of all, let's load the dataset and have a first look into the shape and structure."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nlistings = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/berlin-airbnb-data/listings_summary.csv\")\nprint(listings.shape)\nlistings.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 2: Describe the dataset\n\nNext, we examine the dataset with more details: column names, data types and missing values."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# 2.1 Check column names\nlistings.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# 2.2 Check dataset info\nlistings.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# 2.3 Examie missing values\nlistings_na = listings.isna().sum()\nlistings_na[listings_na.values > 0].sort_values(ascending=False) # Find out all variables that contain missing values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 3: Pre-process column \"price\"\n\nSince \"price\" is our target variable, we need to make sure it is in good shape: no missing values, data type is correct, etc.\n\nFrom Step 2 we have seen that variable \"price\" does not have any missing values, therefore we can skip the examination of missing values."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# 3.1 Describe column \"price\"\nlistings.describe(include=\"all\")[\"price\"]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Step 3.1 suggests that column \"price\" is of type object rather than int/float.
