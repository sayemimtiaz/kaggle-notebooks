Basically I tried to show distribution of data, relations between variables and target as well as correlations between each other then did some basic model building.\n\nThe data includes 303 patient level features including if they have heart disease at the end or not. Features are like;\n\n- Age: Obvious one...\n- Sex:\n    - 0: Female\n    - 1: Male\n- Chest Pain Type: \n    - 0: Typical Angina\n    - 1: Atypical Angina\n    - 2: Non-Anginal Pain\n    - 3: Asymptomatic\n- Resting Blood Pressure: Person's resting blood pressure.\n- Cholesterol: Serum Cholesterol in mg/dl  \n- Fasting Blood Sugar:\n    - 0:Less Than 120mg/ml\n    - 1: Greater Than 120mg/ml\n- Resting Electrocardiographic Measurement:\n    - 0: Normal\n    - 1: ST-T Wave Abnormality\n    - 2: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy\n- Max Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved\n- Exercise Induced Angina:\n    - 1: Yes\n    - 0: No\n- ST Depression: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.\n- Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment:\n    - 0: Upsloping\n    - 1: Flat\n    - 2: Downsloping\n- Thalassemia: A blood disorder called 'Thalassemia':\n    - 0: Normal\n    - 1: Fixed Defect\n    - 2: Reversable Defect\n- Number of Major Vessels: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.\n\nAfter doing some usual exploratory data analysis I noticed some of the results doesn't make sense, I ain't no expert in field but made me curious and then I found this topic here [The ultimate guide to this dataset!](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/discussion/105877), his points made sense so I decided to use this dataset after inspecting it: [Heart Disease Cleveland UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci).\n\nI'd say it gave me more reasonable results and decided to stick with it, both datasets are pretty close but targets are reversed. It's up to you what dataset you choose, the original one gave me better F1 score but as I said EDA didn't make sense to but I have to tell I'm just inspecting the data and have no medical knowledge on the field.\n\nOne last note: I used some sklearn features just for the sake of showing them, they might be not needed in actual use for this case...\n\nWell, let's get goin then!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading

I'll do small quotes for each classifier from sklearn's official page:\n\n## GradientBoostingClassifier\n\n> Gradient Tree Boosting or Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) is a generalization of boosting to arbitrary differentiable loss functions. GBDT is an accurate and effective off-the-shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and classification problems in a variety of areas including Web search ranking and ecology.\n\n## KNeighborsClassifier\n\n> Neighbors-based classification is a type of instance-based learning or non-generalizing learning: it does not attempt to construct a general internal model, but simply stores instances of the training data. Classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point.\n\n## DecisionTreeClassifier\n\n> Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. Decision trees learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model.\n\n## Support Vector Machines\n\n> Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.\n- The advantages of support vector machines are:\n    - Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n    - Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n    - Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n    - Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n    \n## RandomForestClassifier\n\n>The sklearn.ensemble module includes two averaging algorithms based on randomized decision trees: the RandomForest algorithm and the Extra-Trees method. Both algorithms are perturb-and-combine technique specifically designed for trees. This means a diverse set of classifiers is created by introducing randomness in the classifier construction. The prediction of the ensemble is given as the averaged prediction of the individual classifiers.\n\n## AdaBoostClassifier\n\n> An AdaBoost classifier is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases.\n\n## MLP Classifier\n\n> Multi-layer Perceptron classifier.\nThis model optimizes the log-loss function using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent.\n\n## GaussianNB\n\n> GaussianNB implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. The likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian.\n\n\n### Ok...

We going to use RandomizedSearchCV for this:\n\n    While using a grid of parameter settings is currently the most widely used method for parameter optimization, other search methods have more favourable properties. RandomizedSearchCV implements a randomized search over parameters, where each setting is sampled from a distribution over possible parameter values. This has two main benefits over an exhaustive search:\n\n    A budget can be chosen independent of the number of parameters and possible values.\n\n    Adding parameters that do not influence the performance does not decrease efficiency.\n\n### I'm going to choose small amount of estimators and not many parameters to search for timing purposes but you'll see even that's useful!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Searching parameters for fine tuning:\n\nfor i in [randfclass,svc, adaclass]:\n    \n    if i == svc:\n        parameters = {\n        'C': [1,3,9,27],\n        'tol': [1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4],\n        'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf', 'sigmoid'],\n        'shrinking': [True, False]}\n        \n    if i == randfclass:\n        parameters = {\n            'max_depth': [2, 3, 5],\n            'n_estimators': [50, 100, 150],\n            'criterion': ['gini', 'entropy'],\n            'bootstrap': [True, False],\n        }\n        \n    if i == adaclass:\n        parameters = {\n            'base_estimator': [None, dectree],\n            'n_estimators': [50, 100, 150],\n            'algorithm': ['SAMME','SAMME.R'],\n            'learning_rate': [0.8,1,1.2],\n        }\n    \n    \n    def hyperparameter_tune(base_model, parameters, n_iter, cv, X, y):\n        \n        ''' A function for optimizing mutliple classifiers'''\n        \n        start_time = time.time()\n        optimal_model = RandomizedSearchCV(base_model,\n                                param_distributions=parameters,\n                                n_iter=n_iter,\n                                cv=cv,\n                                scoring = 'f1',\n                                n_jobs=-1,\n                                random_state=seed)\n\n        optimal_model.fit(X, y)    \n\n\n        scores = cross_val_score(optimal_model, X, y, cv=cv,n_jobs=-1, scoring='f1')\n        stop_time = time.time()\n\n        print('====================')\n        print(f'Updated Parameters for {str(base_model.__class__.__name__)}')\n        print('Cross Val Mean: {:.3f}, Cross Val Stdev: {:.3f}'.format(scores.mean(), scores.std()))\n        print('Best Score: {:.3f}'.format(optimal_model.best_score_))\n        print('Best Parameters: {}'.format(optimal_model.best_params_))\n        print('Elapsed Time:', time.strftime('%H:%M:%S', time.gmtime(stop_time - start_time)))\n        print('====================')\n\n\n        return optimal_model.best_params_, optimal_model.best_score_\n    best_params, best_score = hyperparameter_tune(i, parameters, 20, cv, X_cat, y_eli)\n    i.set_params(**best_params)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Tuned Model Results\n\n### Alright!
