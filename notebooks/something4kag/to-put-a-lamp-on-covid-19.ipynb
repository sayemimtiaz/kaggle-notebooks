The basic idea is the same: it multiplies the number of particular viral genes in a sample so they can be observed.\n\nBut LAMP is designed to be much simpler, faster and cheaper than PCR.\n\n* LAMP tests can be conducted in a simple heat bath, meaning almost any lab or hospital could theoretically do the test.\n\n* The results are confirmed by a dye that changes colour — allowing them to be read with the naked eye.\n \n* The result takes just 30 minutes, and as a result, has the potential to allow a huge number to be done quickly, concurrently and in almost any location.\n\nLindomar Pena from the Department of Virology at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Brazil has done extensive work on LAMP diagnosis tests, including validating a LAMP test for the Zika virus. He said the process was extremely sensitive, meaning if it's well designed and conducted, it's highly unlikely to miss any case.\n\nBut that same sensitivity means the test will sometimes return false positives.\n\nDr Lindomar said that while that's problematic in many instances, it's not for COVID-19.\n\"You want as many positives as possible, to control it and trace all the contacts,\" Dr Lindomar said.\nHe said missing cases of COVID-19 would be a big problem, but falsely identifying some cases would not.  \n[Ref LAMP](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-25/amateur-scientist-making-a-rapid-test-for-coronavirus/12084974)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i0.wp.com/foundry.bio/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Loop-mediated-Isothermal-Amplification-LAMP.jpg?resize=768%2C403&ssl=1)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%HTML\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='760' height='428' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/L5zi2P4lggw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></div>\n</div><figcaption>Watch this video from New England Biolabs on how LAMP works. </figcaption></figure>\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#from covid_19_utility_script import *\nfrom covid_19_utility_script_v2 import *","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Topics Tags used in this Notebook in code cell hidden below.
